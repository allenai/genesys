Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.66)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

To address this problem, the existing methods either require substantial costs or introduce precision loss. In this paper, we empirically find that the accuracy of the LLM's prediction is highly correlated to its certainty. Based on this, we propose an efficient training free framework, named XL3M (it means extra-long large language model), which enables the LLMs trained on short sequences to reason extremely long sequence without any further training or fine-tuning. Under the XL3M framework, the input context will be firstly decomposed into multiple short sub-contexts, where each sub-context contains an independent segment and a common ``question'' which is a few tokens from the end of the original context. Then XL3M gives a method to measure the relevance between each segment and the ``question'', and constructs a concise key context by splicing all the relevant segments in chronological order. The key context is further used instead of the original context to complete the inference task. Evaluations on comprehensive benchmarks show the superiority of XL3M. Using our framework, a Llama2-7B model is able to reason 20M long sequences on an 8-card Huawei Ascend 910B NPU machine with 64GB memory per card.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/19 (Score: 0.35)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2302.13971, 2023.

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention limit its application on long text. In this paper, adopting a fine-to-coarse attention mechanism on multi-scale spans via binary partitioning (BP), we propose BP-Transformer (BPT for short). BPT yields $O(k\\cdot n\\log (n/k))$ connections where $k$ is a hyperparameter to control the density of attention. BPT has a good balance between computation complexity and model capacity. A series of experiments on text classification, machine translation and language modeling shows BPT has a superior performance for long text than previous self-attention models. Our code, hyperparameters and CUDA kernels for sparse attention are available in PyTorch.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/20 (Score: 0.27)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Sungjin Ahn, and Yoshua Bengio. 2017.

We introduce Megalodon, a neural architecture for efficient sequence modeling with unlimited context length. Megalodon inherits the architecture of Mega (exponential moving average with gated attention), and further introduces multiple technical components to improve its capability and stability, including complex exponential moving average (CEMA), timestep normalization layer, normalized attention mechanism and pre-norm with two-hop residual configuration. In a controlled head-to-head comparison with Llama2, Megalodon achieves better efficiency than Transformer in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

AMR Parsing with Causal Hierarchical Attention and Pointers\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical attention language models\"*\n\n*Chao Lou, Kewei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel model is introduced, CHAP, which is equipped with causal hierarchical attention and the pointer mechanism, enabling the integration of structures into the Transformer decoder, and which outperforms baseline models on four out of five benchmarks in the setting of no additional data.\n\n**Abstract:** Translation-based AMR parsers have recently gained popularity due to their simplicity and effectiveness. They predict linearized graphs as free texts, avoiding explicit structure modeling. However, this simplicity neglects structural locality in AMR graphs and introduces unnecessary tokens to represent coreferences. In this paper, we introduce new target forms of AMR parsing and a novel model, CHAP, which is equipped with causal hierarchical attention and the pointer mechanism, enabling the integration of structures into the Transformer decoder. We empirically explore various alternative modeling options. Experiments show that our model outperforms baseline models on four out of five benchmarks in the setting of no additional data.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Dior-CVAE: Pre-trained Language Models and Diffusion Priors for Variational Dialog Generation\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical attention language models\"*\n\n*Tianyu Yang, Thy Thy Tran, Iryna Gurevych*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work employs a diffusion model to increase the complexity of the prior distribution and its compatibility with the distributions produced by a PLM, and proposes memory dropout to the cross-attention mechanism, which actively encourages the use of latent variables for response generation.\n\n**Abstract:** Current variational dialog models have employed pre-trained language models (PLMs) to parameterize the likelihood and posterior distributions. However, the Gaussian assumption made on the prior distribution is incompatible with these distributions, thus restricting the diversity of generated responses. These models also suffer from posterior collapse, i.e., the decoder tends to ignore latent variables and directly access information captured in the encoder through the cross-attention mechanism. In this work, we propose Dior-CVAE, a hierarchical conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with diffusion priors to address these challenges. We employ a diffusion model to increase the complexity of the prior distribution and its compatibility with the distributions produced by a PLM. Also, we propose memory dropout to the cross-attention mechanism, which actively encourages the use of latent variables for response generation. Overall, experiments across two commonly used open-domain dialog datasets show that our method can generate more diverse responses without large-scale dialog pre-training.

HAConvGNN: Hierarchical Attention Based Convolutional Graph Neural Network for Code Documentation Generation in Jupyter Notebooks\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical attention language models\"*\n\n*Xuye Liu, Dakuo Wang, A. Wang, Lingfei Wu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new model is proposed (HAConvGNN) that uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to consider therelevant code cells and the relevant code tokens information when generating the documentation in computational notebooks.\n\n**Abstract:** Jupyter notebook allows data scientists to write machine learning code together with its documentation in cells. In this paper, we propose a new task of code documentation generation (CDG) for computational notebooks. In contrast to the previous CDG tasks which focus on generating documentation for single code snippets, in a computational notebook, one documentation in a markdown cell often corresponds to multiple code cells, and these code cells have an inherent structure. We proposed a new model (HAConvGNN) that uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to consider the relevant code cells and the relevant code tokens information when generating the documentation. Tested on a new corpus constructed from well-documented Kaggle notebooks, we show that our model outperforms other baseline models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 4. NAT: Neural Architecture Transformer for Accurate and Compact Architectures\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory optimization in transformer architectures\"*\n\n*Yong Guo, Yin Zheng, Mingkui Tan, Qi Chen, Jian Chen, P. Zhao, Junzhou Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the transformed architecture by NAT significantly outperforms both its original form and those architectures optimized by existing methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Designing effective architectures is one of the key factors behind the success of deep neural networks. Existing deep architectures are either manually designed or automatically searched by some Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods. However, even a well-searched architecture may still contain many non-significant or redundant modules or operations (e.g., convolution or pooling), which may not only incur substantial memory consumption and computation cost but also deteriorate the performance. Thus, it is necessary to optimize the operations inside an architecture to improve the performance without introducing extra computation cost. Unfortunately, such a constrained optimization problem is NP-hard. To make the problem feasible, we cast the optimization problem into a Markov decision process (MDP) and seek to learn a Neural Architecture Transformer (NAT) to replace the redundant operations with the more computationally efficient ones (e.g., skip connection or directly removing the connection). Based on MDP, we learn NAT by exploiting reinforcement learning to obtain the optimization policies w.r.t. different architectures. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, we apply NAT on both hand-crafted architectures and NAS based architectures. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, demonstrate that the transformed architecture by NAT significantly outperforms both its original form and those architectures optimized by existing methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 78  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5. Block Low-Rank Preconditioner with Shared Basis for Stochastic Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory optimization in transformer architectures\"*\n\n*Jui-Nan Yen, Sai Surya Duvvuri, Inderjit S. Dhillon, Cho-Jui Hsieh*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes approximating the diagonal blocks of the second moment matrix by low-rank matrices and enforcing the same basis for the blocks within each layer within each layer, and designs an algorithm to maintain this shared-basis block low-rank approximation during training.\n\n**Abstract:** Adaptive methods with non-diagonal preconditioning have shown state-of-the-art results on various tasks. However, their computational complexity and memory requirement make it challenging to scale these methods to modern neural network architectures. To address this challenge, some previous works have adopted block-diagonal preconditioners. However, the memory cost of storing the block-diagonal matrix remains substantial, leading to the use of smaller block sizes that ultimately leads to suboptimal performance. To reduce the time and memory complexity without sacri\ufb01cing performance, we propose approximating the diagonal blocks of the second moment matrix by low-rank matrices and enforcing the same basis for the blocks within each layer.

MCUFormer: Deploying Vision Tranformers on Microcontrollers with Limited Memory\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory optimization in transformer architectures\"*\n\n*Yinan Liang, Ziwei Wang, Xiuwei Xu, Yansong Tang, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hardware-algorithm co-optimizations method to deploy vision transformers on microcontrollers with extremely limited memory called MCUFormer is proposed, where the one-shot network architecture search (NAS) is generalized to discover the optimal architecture with highest task performance given the memory budget from the micro Controllers.\n\n**Abstract:** Due to the high price and heavy energy consumption of GPUs, deploying deep models on IoT devices such as microcontrollers makes significant contributions for ecological AI. Conventional methods successfully enable convolutional neural network inference of high resolution images on microcontrollers, while the framework for vision transformers that achieve the state-of-the-art performance in many vision applications still remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a hardware-algorithm co-optimizations method called MCUFormer to deploy vision transformers on microcontrollers with extremely limited memory, where we jointly design transformer architecture and construct the inference operator library to fit the memory resource constraint. More specifically, we generalize the one-shot network architecture search (NAS) to discover the optimal architecture with highest task performance given the memory budget from the microcontrollers, where we enlarge the existing search space of vision transformers by considering the low-rank decomposition dimensions and patch resolution for memory reduction. For the construction of the inference operator library of vision transformers, we schedule the memory buffer during inference through operator integration, patch embedding decomposition, and token overwriting, allowing the memory buffer to be fully utilized to adapt to the forward pass of the vision transformer. Experimental results demonstrate that our MCUFormer achieves 73.62\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet for image classification with 320KB memory on STM32F746 microcontroller.

Test-Time Prompt Tuning for Zero-Shot Generalization in Vision-Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training in language models\"*\n\n*Manli Shu, Weili Nie, De-An Huang, Zhiding Yu, T. Goldstein, Anima Anandkumar, Chaowei Xiao*\n\n**TL;DR:** Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) is proposed, a method that can learn adaptive prompts on the fly with a single test sample and performs on par with the state-of-the-art approaches that use additional training data.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have shown promising zero-shot generalization in many downstream tasks with properly designed text prompts. Instead of relying on hand-engineered prompts, recent works learn prompts using the training data from downstream tasks. While effective, training on domain-specific data reduces a model's generalization capability to unseen new domains. In this work, we propose test-time prompt tuning (TPT), a method that can learn adaptive prompts on the fly with a single test sample. For image classification, TPT optimizes the prompt by minimizing the entropy with confidence selection so that the model has consistent predictions across different augmented views of each test sample. In evaluating generalization to natural distribution shifts, TPT improves the zero-shot top-1 accuracy of CLIP by 3.6% on average, surpassing previous prompt tuning approaches that require additional task-specific training data. In evaluating cross-dataset generalization with unseen categories, TPT performs on par with the state-of-the-art approaches that use additional training data.

Test-Time Adaptation with CLIP Reward for Zero-Shot Generalization in Vision-Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training in language models\"*\n\n*Shuai Zhao, Xiaohan Wang, Linchao Zhu, Yezhou Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes TTA with feedback to rectify the model output and prevent the model from becoming blindly confident, and builds different fully TTA pipelines with RLCF to improve the zero-shot generalization ability of various VLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** One fascinating aspect of pre-trained vision-language models~(VLMs) learning under language supervision is their impressive zero-shot generalization capability. However, this ability is hindered by distribution shifts between the training and testing data. Previous test time adaptation~(TTA) methods for VLMs in zero-shot classification rely on minimizing the entropy of model outputs, tending to be stuck in incorrect model predictions. In this work, we propose TTA with feedback to rectify the model output and prevent the model from becoming blindly confident. Specifically, a CLIP model is adopted as the reward model during TTA and provides feedback for the VLM. Given a single test sample, the VLM is forced to maximize the CLIP reward between the input and sampled results from the VLM output distribution. The proposed \\textit{reinforcement learning with CLIP feedback~(RLCF)} framework is highly flexible and universal. Beyond the classification task, with task-specific sampling strategies and a proper reward baseline choice, RLCF can be easily extended to not only discrimination tasks like retrieval but also generalization tasks like image captioning, improving the zero-shot generalization capacity of VLMs. According to the characteristics of these VL tasks, we build different fully TTA pipelines with RLCF to improve the zero-shot generalization ability of various VLMs. Extensive experiments along with promising empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of RLCF.

However,\nit is evident that state-of-the-art (SOTA) sequence-based models like the\nTransformer struggle to encode such structures inherently. On the other hand,\ndedicated models like the Tree-LSTM, while explicitly modeling hierarchical\nstructures, do not perform as efficiently as the Transformer. In this paper, we\nattempt to bridge this gap with \"Hierarchical Accumulation\" to encode parse\ntree structures into self-attention at constant time complexity. Our approach\noutperforms SOTA methods in four IWSLT translation tasks and the WMT'14\nEnglish-German translation task. It also yields improvements over Transformer\nand Tree-LSTM on three text classification tasks. We further demonstrate that\nusing hierarchical priors can compensate for data shortage, and that our model\nprefers phrase-level attentions over token-level attentions.\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-19T08:17:00Z  (*Updated: 2020-02-19T08:17:00Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

This paper investigates the applicability of the\nearly-bird ticket hypothesis to optimize the training efficiency of Transformer\nmodels. We propose a methodology that combines iterative pruning, masked\ndistance calculation, and selective retraining to identify early-bird tickets\nin various Transformer architectures, including ViT, Swin-T, GPT-2, and\nRoBERTa. Our experimental results demonstrate that early-bird tickets can be\nconsistently found within the first few epochs of training or fine-tuning,\nenabling significant resource optimization without compromising performance.\nThe pruned models obtained from early-bird tickets achieve comparable or even\nsuperior accuracy to their unpruned counterparts while substantially reducing\nmemory usage. Furthermore, our comparative analysis highlights the\ngeneralizability of the early-bird ticket phenomenon across different\nTransformer models and tasks. This research contributes to the development of\nefficient training strategies for Transformer models, making them more\naccessible and resource-friendly.

LiteTransformerSearch: Training-free Neural Architecture Search for\n  Efficient Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory optimization in transformer architectures\"*\n\n*Mojan Javaheripi, Gustavo H. de Rosa, Subhabrata Mukherjee, Shital Shah, Tomasz L. Religa, Caio C. T. Mendes, Sebastien Bubeck, Farinaz Koushanfar, Debadeepta Dey*\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture is ubiquitously used as the building block of\nlarge-scale autoregressive language models. However, finding architectures with\nthe optimal trade-off between task performance (perplexity) and hardware\nconstraints like peak memory utilization and latency is non-trivial. This is\nexacerbated by the proliferation of various hardware. We leverage the somewhat\nsurprising empirical observation that the number of decoder parameters in\nautoregressive Transformers has a high rank correlation with task performance,\nirrespective of the architecture topology. This observation organically induces\na simple Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm that uses decoder\nparameters as a proxy for perplexity without need for any model training. The\nsearch phase of our training-free algorithm, dubbed Lightweight Transformer\nSearch (LTS), can be run directly on target devices since it does not require\nGPUs. Using on-target-device measurements, LTS extracts the Pareto-frontier of\nperplexity versus any hardware performance cost. We evaluate LTS on diverse\ndevices from ARM CPUs to NVIDIA GPUs and two popular autoregressive Transformer\nbackbones: GPT-2 and Transformer-XL. Results show that the perplexity of\n16-layer GPT-2 and Transformer-XL can be achieved with up to 1.5x, 2.5x faster\nruntime and 1.2x, 2.0x lower peak memory utilization. When evaluated in zero\nand one-shot settings, LTS Pareto-frontier models achieve higher average\naccuracy compared to the 350M parameter OPT across 14 tasks, with up to 1.6x\nlower latency. LTS extracts the Pareto-frontier in under 3 hours while running\non a commodity laptop. We effectively remove the carbon footprint of hundreds\nof GPU hours of training during search, offering a strong simple baseline for\nfuture NAS methods in autoregressive language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-04T02:10:43Z  (*Updated: 2022-10-17T22:36:18Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Cross-Lingual Fine-Grained Entity Typing\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training in language models\"*\n\n*Nila Selvaraj, Yasumasa Onoe, Greg Durrett*\n\n**Abstract:** The growth of cross-lingual pre-trained models has enabled NLP tools to\nrapidly generalize to new languages. While these models have been applied to\ntasks involving entities, their ability to explicitly predict typological\nfeatures of these entities across languages has not been established. In this\npaper, we present a unified cross-lingual fine-grained entity typing model\ncapable of handling over 100 languages and analyze this model's ability to\ngeneralize to languages and entities unseen during training. We train this\nmodel on cross-lingual training data collected from Wikipedia hyperlinks in\nmultiple languages (training languages). During inference, our model takes an\nentity mention and context in a particular language (test language, possibly\nnot in the training languages) and predicts fine-grained types for that entity.\nGeneralizing to new languages and unseen entities are the fundamental\nchallenges of this entity typing setup, so we focus our evaluation on these\nsettings and compare against simple yet powerful string match baselines.\nExperimental results show that our approach outperforms the baselines on unseen\nlanguages such as Japanese, Tamil, Arabic, Serbian, and Persian. In addition,\nour approach substantially improves performance on unseen entities (even in\nunseen languages) over the baselines, and human evaluation shows a strong\nability to predict relevant types in these settings.\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-15T03:22:30Z  (*Updated: 2021-10-15T03:22:30Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6.

SOWA: Adapting Hierarchical Frozen Window Self-Attention to Visual-Language Models for Better Anomaly Detection\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical attention language models\"*\n\n*Zhaosheng Zhang, Zongxiang Hu*\n\n**Abstract:** Visual anomaly detection is critical in industrial manufacturing, but traditional methods often rely on extensive normal datasets and custom models, limiting scalability. Recent advancements in large-scale visual-language models have significantly improved zero/few-shot anomaly detection. However, these approaches may not fully utilize hierarchical features, potentially missing nuanced details. We introduce a window self-attention mechanism based on the CLIP model, combined with learnable prompts to process multi-level features within a Soldier-Offier Window self-Attention (SOWA) framework. Our method has been tested on five benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance by leading in 18 out of 20 metrics compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-04\n\n\n\n#### 2. Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical attention language models\"*\n\n*Baining Guo, Stephen Lin, Zheng Zhang, Yixuan Wei, Han Hu, Yue Cao, Yutong Lin, Ze Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \\textbf{S}hifted \\textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

Scalable Second Order Optimization for Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory optimization in transformer architectures\"*\n\n*Rohan Anil, Kevin Regan, Yoram Singer, Vineet Gupta, Tomer Koren*\n\n**Abstract:** Optimization in machine learning, both theoretical and applied, is presently dominated by first-order gradient methods such as stochastic gradient descent. Second-order optimization methods, that involve second derivatives and/or second order statistics of the data, are far less prevalent despite strong theoretical properties, due to their prohibitive computation, memory and communication costs. In an attempt to bridge this gap between theoretical and practical optimization, we present a scalable implementation of a second-order preconditioned method (concretely, a variant of full-matrix Adagrad), that along with several critical algorithmic and numerical improvements, provides significant convergence and wall-clock time improvements compared to conventional first-order methods on state-of-the-art deep models. Our novel design effectively utilizes the prevalent heterogeneous hardware architecture for training deep models, consisting of a multicore CPU coupled with multiple accelerator units. We demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art on very large learning tasks such as machine translation with Transformers, language modeling with BERT, click-through rate prediction on Criteo, and image classification on ImageNet with ResNet-50.\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-20\n\n\n\n#### 4. LightSeq2: Accelerated Training for Transformer-based Models on GPUs\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory optimization in transformer architectures\"*\n\n*Yufei Ding, Guyue Huang, Mingxuan Wang, Lei LI, Yang Wei, Xian Qian, Ying Xiong, Xiaohui Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based neural models are used in many AI applications. Training these models is expensive, as it takes huge GPU resources and long duration. It is challenging because typical data like sentences have variable lengths, and Transformer's computation patterns are more complex than convolutional neural networks. Existing systems either only focus on model inference or optimization for only BERT-like encoder models. In this paper, we present LightSeq2, a system to accelerate training for a general family of Transformer models on GPUs. We propose a series of GPU optimization techniques tailored to the specific computation flow and memory access patterns of Transformer models. LightSeq2 supports many model architectures, including BERT (encoder-only), GPT (decoder-only), Transformer (encoder-decoder), and vision Transformer. Our experiments for a variety of models and benchmarks show that LightSeq2 is consistently faster (1.4-3.5x) than previous systems on different GPUs. In particular, it gains 308% training speedup compared with existing systems on a large public machine translation benchmark (WMT14 English-German).\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-12\n\n\n\n#### 5. Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training in language models\"*\n\n*Yu Sun, Moritz Hardt*\n\n**Abstract:** Many recent efforts augment language models with retrieval, by adding retrieved data to the input context. For this approach to succeed, the retrieved data must be added at both training and test time. Moreover, as input length grows linearly with the size of retrieved data, cost in computation and memory grows quadratically for modern Transformers. To avoid these complications, we simply fine-tune the model on retrieved data at test time, using its standard training setup. We build a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset. For each test input, our system retrieves its neighbors and fine-tunes the model on their text. Surprisingly, retrieving and training on as few as 20 neighbors, each for only one gradient iteration, drastically improves performance across more than 20 language modeling tasks in the Pile. For example, test-time training with nearest neighbors significantly narrows the performance gap between a small GPT-2 and a GPT-Neo model more than 10 times larger. Sufficient index quality and size, however, are necessary. Our work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-29\n\n\n\n#### 6. Selecting Informative Contexts Improves Language Model Finetuning\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training in language models\"*\n\n*Nicole Beckage, Richard Antonello, Javier Turek, Alexander Huth*\n\n**Abstract:** Language model fine-tuning is essential for modern natural language processing, but is computationally expensive and time-consuming. Further, the effectiveness of fine-tuning is limited by the inclusion of training examples that negatively affect performance. Here we present a general fine-tuning method that we call information gain filtration for improving the overall training efficiency and final performance of language model fine-tuning. We define the information gain of an example as the improvement on a test metric after training on that example. A secondary learner is then trained to approximate this quantity. During fine-tuning, this learner selects informative examples and skips uninformative ones. We show that our method has consistent improvement across datasets, fine-tuning tasks, and language model architectures. For example, we achieve a median perplexity of 54.0 on a books dataset compared to 57.3 for standard fine-tuning. We present statistical evidence that offers insight into the improvements of our method over standard fine-tuning. The generality of our method leads us to propose a new paradigm for language model fine-tuning -- we encourage researchers to release pretrained secondary learners on common corpora to promote efficient and effective fine-tuning, thereby improving the performance and reducing the overall energy footprint of language model fine-tuning.\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goals of enhancing the `FastTTTLinear` Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) with hierarchical multi-scale processing, memory optimization, and test-time training, here are the most relevant and useful pieces of information from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n### Hierarchical Multi-Scale Processing\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms:**\n  - The concept of hierarchical attention is well-demonstrated in the Nova model, which uses a hierarchical self-attention mechanism to capture semantics at different granularity levels.

Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token (Avg. Score: 0.88)\n\n*Franz A. Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.82)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.82)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

DeciMamba: Exploring the Length Extrapolation Potential of Mamba (Avg. Score: 0.63)\n\n*Assaf Ben-Kish, Itamar Zimerman, Shady Abu-Hussein, Nadav Cohen, Amir Globerson, Lior Wolf, Raja Giryes*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** DeciMamba is introduced, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba that can extrapolate to context lengths that are 25x times longer than the ones seen during training, and does so without utilizing additional computational resources.\n\n**Abstract:** Long-range sequence processing poses a significant challenge for Transformers due to their quadratic complexity in input length. A promising alternative is Mamba, which demonstrates high performance and achieves Transformer-level capabilities while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. In this paper we explore the length-generalization capabilities of Mamba, which we find to be relatively limited. Through a series of visualizations and analyses we identify that the limitations arise from a restricted effective receptive field, dictated by the sequence length used during training. To address this constraint, we introduce DeciMamba, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba. This mechanism, built on top of a hidden filtering mechanism embedded within the S6 layer, enables the trained model to extrapolate well even without additional training. Empirical experiments over real-world long-range NLP tasks show that DeciMamba can extrapolate to context lengths that are 25x times longer than the ones seen during training, and does so without utilizing additional computational resources. We will release our code and models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/27 (Score: 0.63)*\n\n```\nLianghui Zhu, Bencheng Liao, Qian Zhang, Xinlong Wang, Wenyu Liu, and Xinggang Wang. 2024.

In each epoch the models train over 6144 sequences of length 2 K . For DeciMamba-130M we use L_base $=2 K, \\beta=0.5$, decimating_layers $=$ $[13, \\ldots, 21]$, min_seq_len $=20$. ## A. 2 Document Retrieval\n\nWe train each model with data from SQuAD v2 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018), which provides examples in the form of (Query, Document, Answer). Our training samples have the following form: <Query>; $N_{\\text {docs }} \\times<$ Document>; $<$ Answer $>$, where $<$ Document $>$ can be either the golden document (which holds the answer to the query) or one of $N_{d o c s}-1$ randomly sampled documents. $<$ Answer $>$ holds the id of the golden document. In our setting $N_{d o c s}=11$, the order of the documents is random, and the query and respective document id are appended to the beginning of each document. During Evaluation we use the same setting but vary the value of $N_{\\text {docs }}$, between 11 and 300. We note that an average document in SQuAD has a length of about 200 tokens, so our average training sample has about 2,000 tokens, and the evaluation samples vary between 2,000 tokens to 60,000 tokens. We train for one epoch with 300 steps, use a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 64 (used batch accumulation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 .

Top- $K \\%$ pooling leads to a limited ERF in layer 17. The size of the attention map is affected by the input sequence length: for $L_{\\text {eval }}=2 K$ layer 17 will process 65 tokens (left) and for $L_{\\text {eval }}=32 \\mathrm{~K}$ it will process 1 K tokens (right). Since $L_{\\text {train }}=2 K$, layer 17 has only seen training sequences of length 65 , therefore suffers from an ERF when $L_{\\text {eval }}$ increases (right, dashed orange shape). ## A. 3 Multi-Document Question Answering With Free Text Response\n\nWe operate in a similar setting as in Section A.2, but instead of predicting the tokens of the id of the relevant document we let the model generate a free-text response and measure it's F1 score w.r.t a set of ground truth answers. We train each model for one epoch on the full SQuAD train set (about 90,000 examples when leaving out the samples intended for negative sampling, which do not have a ground-truth answer). We found that the optimal decimation parameters are decimation_layer $=14$, $L_{\\text {base }}=2000$ during training and $L_{\\text {base }}=7000$ during evaluation. We intentionally decreased Lbase during training so the model could experience decimation during the training period ( $L_{\\text {train }}$ was a bit higher than $L_{\\text {base }}$ ), because otherwise the training of DeciMamba and Mamba would have been identical. We use a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 64 (used batch accumu-\nlation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 . ## A. 4 PG-19 Perplexity\n\nWe train each model on a total of 100 M tokens with a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 250 (used batch accumulation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 . During training we sample a single window from each example and train on it (For the extrapolating models the window length is 2 K , for the lower bound models the window length is equal to the context length trained on). During evaluation, for each example we evaluate 10 windows with a maximal constant stride. We evaluate only the last 100 labels in each window, which represent the extrapolation abilities of the model at sequence lengths in the range of [ctx_len -100 , ctx_len], providing an approximation to the model's performance at the wanted ctx_len. For DeciMamba-130M we use L_base $=2 K, \\beta=0.83$, decimating_layers $=$ $[12, \\ldots, 20]$, min_seq_len $=20$. During evaluation we keep the same parameters except setting L_base $=8 K$. Additionally, in this specific task DeciMamba was trained with a similar, yet not identical, Language Modeling (LM) loss. We break the labels sequence (length $=2 \\mathrm{~K}$ ) into two chunks. The first 1 K labels are trained conditionally on the first 1 K tokens of the sequence (like vanilla $\\mathrm{LM})$. The last 1 K labels are trained conditionally on the whole sequence ( 2 K ), and DeciMamba was configured to compress the first 1 K input tokens. This way we are able to train DeciMamba to compress context while training on each label in the sequence, making the training much more efficient. We also experimented with chunking the labels into more than two chunks, but only experienced a slowdown in computation while achieving similar performance. For the lower bound models we had to reduce the amount of training steps in order to constrain the training to 100M tokens. Specifically, for each context length, we followed the following formula: num_of_steps $=100 \\mathrm{M} /$ (batch_size* $\\left.c t x \\_l e n\\right)=100 M /\\left(250 * c t x \\_l e n\\right)$. For the ZeroShot perplexity test for the 1.4 b model we used Layer 12 for decimation and $L_{b a s e}=4000$. For the 2.8 b model we used Layer 22 for decimation and $L_{\\text {base }}=4000$. ## B Other Related Work\n\n## B. 1 Long Range Transformers. Transformers have emerged as highly effective models for various tasks, yet their widespread adoption has been constrained by their limited longrange modeling capabilities. Thus, applying transformers effectively to long-range data remains a central challenge in DL, particularly in NLP. A primary factor in this challenge is that the effective context of transformers is dominated by the context observed during training, which is limited because training LLMs on datasets with billions of tokens across lengthy sequences is computationally demanding. Hence, three main approaches have been developed to tackle this problem: (i) creating efficient variants of transformers that allow an increase in the length of sequences during training. (ii) Context extension methods, which enable training on short sequences and evaluation on long sequences, and finally, (iii) hierarchical models that rely on pooling, chunking, and compression. Despite these extensive efforts, several recent studies indicate that high-quality handling of long text remains an unresolved issue (Liu et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2024). Efficient transformers. Over the years, many approaches have been proposed for making transformers more efficient (Tay et al., 2022; Fournier et al., 2023). The two most prominent directions are hardware-aware implementations such as flashattention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) and ringattention (Liu et al., 2023), which accelerate computations over long sequences by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, developing efficient attention variants with sub-quadratic complexity has become very popular. Two notable examples are Linformer (Wang et al., 2020), which utilizes a low-rank attention matrix, and Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020), a variant that approximates the attention operator through a kernel function. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_e89110ee242b61a620bfg-14.jpg?height=549&width=1599&top_left_y=441&top_left_x=237)\nFigure 13: Demonstrating the 'Importance-Scoring' Abilities of $\\Delta_{t}$.

The horizontal and vertical axes indicate the token number and the channel respectively.

However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.

Besides, in our ablation study, the efficiency metrics reported in Table 6 and Table 7 are evaluated under the same setup used during training. Remark on Modeling Short Sequences. Unfortunately, similar to most previous efficient attention baselines, EVA also runs slower than softmax attention under shorter sequences (e.g., length of 128 or 256), but it soon catches up in running speed, and the reduction of memory consumption is still significant. Besides, in short-sequence settings (such as the case of DeiT-Tiny/Small with sequences of 196 tokens), EVA often performs on par with or better than conventional softmax attention (see Table 1, whereas most previous attention variants usually perform much worse. This implies EVA can achieve a better trade-off between efficiency and quality: for short sequences, EVA is possible to achieve stronger performance competitive with softmax attention (despite in longer running time); while for long sequences, EVA can be run much faster with less memory. Comparison to Memory-efficient Attention Mechanisms. In this section, we conduct an empirical efficiency comparison between efficient approximate attention methods and FlashAttention, one of the memory-efficient attention mechanisms (Rabe \\& Staats, 2021, Dao et al., 2022) with optimized memory accesses. FlashAttention computes the exact softmax attention in an online manner without materializing the full attention matrix, achieving linear memory complexity with respect to sequence lengths; besides, both runtime and memory usage are further improved by minimizing IO accesses. We benchmark different attention modules on one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU, where we measure the memory usage and runtime of running a single attention block, consisting of 8 attention heads with 512 embedding dimension size, for both a forward and backward pass. As shown in Figure 2, we observe that FlashAttention achieves significant memory usage reduction for softmax attention approximation and even consumes much less memory than all considered approximate baselines under all sequence lengths. In terms of runtime, we notice that FlashAttention runs faster than most attention baselines under sequence lengths less than 2048 despite scaling quadratically, but EVA, along with other more efficient approximate variants, begin to catch up at longer sequence lengths. This implies that the quadratic computational costs of softmax attention still bottleneck its runtime performance, aligning with one of the main findings in Dao et al. (2022). According to this empirical study, we observe that FlashAttention offers a general and effective technique to speed up softmax attention; since many approximate variants (including EVA) exhibit a similar formulation to softmax attention (e.g., Equation 16), we expect they can also benefit from the optimized online softmax calculation technique and memory accesses of FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022). ## F EXPERIMENTS on Long RANGE ArEnA\n\nLong Range Arena (LRA; Tay et al. 2021) is a lightweight benchmark that assesses the ability of efficient attention methods to model long sequences in diverse domains. We follow the same hyper-parameter setup as Xiong et al.

We observe that EVA largely improves previous RFA methods such as Performer (Choromanski et al. 2021) and LARA (Zheng et al., 2022b), and performs competitively with full softmax attention. Notably, EVA even achieves better average results over all tasks, with higher accuracy on Image and Pathfinder benchmarks, suggesting its capability of capturing long-term dependencies. For LRA benchmark, we set all attention-specific hyper-parameters to 128 (e.g., the number of landmarks in Nystr\u00f6mformer (Xiong et al. 2021b) and LARA (Zheng et al., 2022b), the window size in local attention and Combiner (Ren et al., 2021), etc.). We set $|E|=128$ and $C=64$ by default for EVA without any further tuning and find this setup works well. ## G Connections to Other AtTEntion Mechanisms\n\n## G. 1 RFA, SoftmAx AtTEntion, And EVA\n\nAs mentioned in our main text, one of the main contributions of this work is to develop a more general framework that bridges RFA and conventional softmax attention. To see how EVA (Equation 13) achieves this goal formally, note that if either $|E|=M$ or $C=M$, EVA would be equivalent to standard softmax attention; while if we set $|E|=0$ and $C=1$, EVA would recover vanilla RFA. ## G. 2 CONNECTIONS TO LARA\n\nNotably, EVA and LARA (Zheng et al. 2022b) are two efficient attention mechanisms that are both built upon the self-normalized importance sampling (SNIS) formulation of RFAs. LARA (Zheng et al. 2022b) puts the main focus on the proposal distribution used in SNIS and tries to design importance sampling proposals that are closer to the true underlying distribution. The proposed usage of multiple proposals further improves the estimation quality of SNIS and achieves strong empirical performance while still keeping linear complexity. In contrast to LARA, in this work we do not focus on the design choice of proposals used in importance sampling but aim to generalize the SNIS formulation further via control variates. As demonstrated in \\$3.2 our theory clearly delineates how the gap between such SNIS estimation and softmax attention can be closed by manipulating control variates. Since LARA and RFA are both SNIS estimators (their main difference lies in the choice of proposal distributions), our generalization also applies to LARA. To summarize, compared with LARA, EVA is a more general framework and improves conventional RFA from an orthogonal perspective. ## G. 3 Connections to Clustered AtTEntion\n\nClustered attention (Vyas et al. 2020) is an efficient attention mechanism that first clusters the set of queries into multiple groups, computes the mean centroid of each group, and then performs attention between query centroids and original key-value pairs. This framework is fast and effective and enjoys well-bounded approximation error. Clustered attention and EVA share some similarities in two aspects. First, both of them adopt the partitioning technique to reduce the computational complexity while remaining effective; and secondly, both observe that the efficient attention mechanism can be improved by refining the approximation over specific elements. For instance, clustered attention can be improved (Vyas et al., 2020) by selecting top- $k$ key-value pairs that are most relevant to each centroid and then refining the approximation by recomputing attention weights over these keys using original queries; while EVA notices that we can directly employ the optimal control variate coefficient for a subset of key-value pairs $(m \\in E)$ while still remaining efficient, which yields a more accurate approximation. Nevertheless, our main technical contribution is to develop a control variate formulation in the context of RFA and demonstrate that how RFA can be further improved locally. On the other hand, while clustered attention (Vyas et al. 2020) clusters queries, EVA partitions key-value pairs. This property makes EVA more amenable to the case of autoregressive language modeling since we do not impose clustering structures over the query set, and thus the causal relation among queries can be well maintained. ## G. 4 CONNECTIONS TO COMBINER\n\nCombiner (Ren et al. 2021) is a recently proposed attention mechanism that also partitions the sequence into chunks combined with local attention. The key difference between EVA and Combiner is the motivation, where Combiner introduces a structured factorization over the attention probability distribution, while our approach is built from the control variate perspective. ## G. 5 CONNECTIONS TO SCATTERbRAIN\n\nIn this section, we show that Scatterbrain (Chen et al., 2021a) can be cast as a special case of our framework EVA, although they are proposed based on quite different motivations. A Brief Review of Scatterbrain. Scatterbrain (Chen et al, 2021a) notes that sparse attention and RFA can approximate sharp and flat regions of the softmax attention matrix well, respectively. Based on this insight, Scatterbrain is proposed to first compute a Performer approximation to softmax attention and then cancel out the approximation error on critical regions via a sparse mechanism. Specifically, Scatterbrain (Chen et al. 2021a) defines a sparse matrix $\\mathbf{S} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times M}$ ) so that for each $(n, m) \\in \\mathbf{S}$ that indexes a non-zero entry. For notational simplicity, we also denote $\\operatorname{Supp}(\\mathbf{S})=\\left\\{(i, j) \\mid S_{i j} \\neq 0\\right\\}$ and $\\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})=\\left\\{m \\mid S_{n m} \\neq 0\\right\\}$. With random features $\\phi(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ defined in Appendix A we let\n\n$$\nS_{n m}=\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right)-\\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe then add it back to the approximate output:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_{n}^{\\prime} & =\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}+\\mathbf{S V} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}+\\sum_{m^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} S_{n m^{\\prime}} \\mathbf{v}_{m^{\\prime}} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m \\notin \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}+\\sum_{m^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m^{\\prime}}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m^{\\prime}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe sparse mechanism can be thought of as modeling the error due to RFA and eliminating it on the support of $\\mathbf{S}$. After the correction step, Scatterbrain further adds a post-hoc normalization step to obtain a normalized attention output:\n\n$$\ny_{n}=\\frac{\\sum_{m \\notin \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}+\\sum_{m^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m^{\\prime}}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m^{\\prime}}}{\\sum_{m \\notin \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)+\\sum_{m^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m^{\\prime}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nIntuitively, Scatterbrain (Chen et al. 2021a) produces accurate approximation in the support of the sparse matrix and remains the random feature approximation outside the support. Scatterbrain is a Special Case of EVA. For notational convenience, we denote $E:=\\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})$. According to Proposition 1, suppose we employ optimal coefficients $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{m}$ for all entries in $\\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})$, and use the same coefficient $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ for all the remaining entries (in other words, we let $C=1$ and the whole index set is only partitioned into two subsets $\\{E,[M] \\backslash E\\})$. Then we have\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5520e6e7b143a538a399g-35.jpg?height=138&width=1160&top_left_y=495&top_left_x=472)\n\nAnd the resulting estimator overall becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widetilde{g}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}) & =\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\widetilde{g}_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m \\in E} \\widetilde{g}_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})+\\sum_{m \\notin E} \\widetilde{g}_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m \\in E} \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}}{Z}+\\sum_{m \\notin E}\\left(g_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} h_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})+\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right)}{Z}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m \\in E} \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}}{Z}+\\sum_{m \\notin E}\\left(g_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} h_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})\\right)+\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\sum_{m \\notin E} \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right)}{Z} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m \\in E} \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}}{Z}+\\sum_{m \\notin E}\\left(g_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} h_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})\\right)+\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\left(1-\\sum_{m \\in E} \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right)}{Z}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nScatterbrain (Chen et al. 2021a) can be a special case of this estimation algorithm if we set the proposal distribution to $q(\\omega)=\\mathcal{N}(\\omega ;

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n#### **Hierarchical Multi-Scale Processing**\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms:**\n  - **Nova Model & HiTs:** These models demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical self-attention in capturing multi-scale dependencies. By structuring attention to operate at different granularities (e.g., intra-instruction vs. inter-instruction), they maintain both local and global contextual understanding. Adopting similar hierarchical structures within GAUs can enhance the model's ability to process long sequences efficiently.\n  \n  - **BP-Transformer:** Utilizes a binary partitioning approach to implement multi-scale attention, maintaining linear complexity while capturing long-range dependencies. This can inspire the design of hierarchical attention within GAUs to balance computational efficiency with expressive power.\n\n#### **Memory Optimization Techniques**\n\n- **Efficient Attention Mechanisms:**\n  - **Swin Transformer & Swin Self-Attention:** The shifted window approach reduces computational complexity by limiting self-attention to non-overlapping local windows, then shifting windows to enable cross-window interactions. Integrating such window-based or sparse attention mechanisms within GAUs can significantly optimize memory usage.\n  \n  - **DenseMamba:** Demonstrates the application of state space models with dense hidden connections to retain fine-grained information without excessive memory overhead. Techniques like selective state integration can be adapted to compress and manage intermediate representations within GAUs.\n  \n  - **Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT):** Highlights the use of blockwise computation to manage long-range contexts efficiently. Implementing blockwise or chunk-based processing within GAUs can help scale memory usage linearly with sequence length.\n\n- **Memory-Efficient Optimization:**\n  - **MEGALODON:** Introduces components like complex exponential moving averages and normalized attention mechanisms to enhance memory efficiency. Applying normalization and moving averages within GAUs can stabilize training and inference while conserving memory.\n\n#### **Test-Time Training Mechanisms**\n\n- **Adaptive and Efficient Training:**\n  - **Test-Time Prompt Tuning (TPT) & Reinforcement Learning with CLIP Feedback (RLCF):** These methods showcase how integrating adaptive mechanisms at inference can enhance zero-shot generalization. Incorporating similar adaptive prompt tuning or reinforcement-based feedback within GAUs during test time can enable dynamic fine-tuning based on input context.\n  \n  - **Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors:** Demonstrates the effectiveness of on-the-fly fine-tuning using nearest neighbors to refine model predictions. Integrating nearest neighbor search and selective gradient updates within GAUs can facilitate efficient test-time adaptation without the need for extensive retraining.\n\n- **Information Gain Filtration (IGF):**  \n  - **Selecting Informative Contexts:** The IGF method emphasizes the importance of selecting training examples that significantly impact model performance. Applying an information gain-based selection mechanism during test-time fine-tuning of GAUs can prioritize impactful updates, enhancing model adaptability and performance.\n\n#### **Dynamic Sparsity and Gating Mechanisms**\n\n- **Gated Attention Units:**\n  - **GatedSparseLinearAttention (GSLA):** Combines gated attention with dynamic sparsity to modulate information flow based on input context. Integrating gated mechanisms within GAUs can allow selective attention computation, reducing unnecessary calculations and optimizing memory usage.\n\n- **Dynamic Sparsity Patterns:**\n  - **Dynamic Context Pruning:** Demonstrates the ability to prune non-informative context dynamically, maintaining model expressiveness while optimizing resource usage. Implementing dynamic sparsity within GAUs can enable efficient handling of long contexts by focusing computational resources on relevant information.\n\n#### **Enhanced Positional Encoding**\n\n- **Kernelized Relative Positional Embeddings (KERPLE):**\n  - **Dynamic Positional Adjustments:** Extends relative positional embeddings using CPD kernels, allowing dynamic adjustments based on input context. Incorporating adaptive positional encodings within GAUs can improve the model's ability to generalize to varying sequence lengths and enhance the capture of positional dependencies.\n\n- **Hierarchical Positional Embeddings:**\n  - **Consistent with Multi-Scale Processing:** Aligning hierarchical attention with hierarchical positional encodings can reinforce the model's ability to process information at multiple scales, further optimizing both memory usage and contextual understanding.\n\n### 4.

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/52 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1409.0473, 2014.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

BiSHop: Bi-Directional Cellular Learning for Tabular Data with Generalized Sparse Modern Hopfield Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparsity attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Chenwei Xu, Yu-Chao Huang, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Weijian Li, Ammar Gilani, H. Goan, Han Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The BiSHop framework, a novel end-to-end framework for deep tabular learning, is introduced, demonstrating that BiSHop surpasses current SOTA methods with significantly less HPO runs, marking it a robust solution for deep tabular learning.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce the \\textbf{B}i-Directional \\textbf{S}parse \\textbf{Hop}field Network (\\textbf{BiSHop}), a novel end-to-end framework for deep tabular learning. BiSHop handles the two major challenges of deep tabular learning: non-rotationally invariant data structure and feature sparsity in tabular data. Our key motivation comes from the recent established connection between associative memory and attention mechanisms. Consequently, BiSHop uses a dual-component approach, sequentially processing data both column-wise and row-wise through two interconnected directional learning modules. Computationally, these modules house layers of generalized sparse modern Hopfield layers, a sparse extension of the modern Hopfield model with adaptable sparsity. Methodologically, BiSHop facilitates multi-scale representation learning, capturing both intra-feature and inter-feature interactions, with adaptive sparsity at each scale. Empirically, through experiments on diverse real-world datasets, we demonstrate that BiSHop surpasses current SOTA methods with significantly less HPO runs, marking it a robust solution for deep tabular learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Transformers meet Stochastic Block Models: Attention with Data-Adaptive Sparsity and Cost\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparsity attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Sungjun Cho, Seonwoo Min, Jinwoo Kim, Moontae Lee, Honglak Lee, Seunghoon Hong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation, and theoretically shows that it outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.\n\n**Abstract:** To overcome the quadratic cost of self-attention, recent works have proposed various sparse attention modules, most of which fall under one of two groups: 1) sparse attention under a hand-crafted patterns and 2) full attention followed by a sparse variant of softmax such as $\\alpha$-entmax. Unfortunately, the first group lacks adaptability to data while the second still requires quadratic cost in training. In this work, we propose SBM-Transformer, a model that resolves both problems by endowing each attention head with a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM). Then, each attention head data-adaptively samples a bipartite graph, the adjacency of which is used as an attention mask for each input. During backpropagation, a straight-through estimator is used to flow gradients beyond the discrete sampling step and adjust the probabilities of sampled edges based on the predictive loss. The forward and backward cost are thus linear to the number of edges, which each attention head can also choose flexibly based on the input. By assessing the distribution of graphs, we theoretically show that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation. Empirical evaluations under the LRA and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.

Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results demonstrate the feasibility of the idea that these super-sparse complex feature detectors of macaque monkeys can serve as prototype memory priors for modulating the image synthesis processes in the visual system.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent discoveries indicate that the neural codes in the super\ufb01cial layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) of macaque monkeys are complex, diverse and super-sparse. This leads us to ponder the computational advantages and functional role of these \u201cgrandmother cells.\" Here, we propose that such cells can serve as prototype memory priors that bias and shape the distributed feature processing during the image generation process in the brain. These memory prototypes are learned by momentum online clustering and are utilized through a memory-based attention operation. Integrating this mechanism, we propose Memory Concept Attention ( MoCA ) to improve few shot image generation quality. We show that having a prototype memory with attention mechanisms can improve image synthesis quality, learn interpretable visual concept clusters, and improve the robustness of the model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the idea that these super-sparse complex feature detectors can serve as prototype memory priors for modulating the image synthesis processes in the visual system.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4.

Some variations of knowledge graphs aim to record arguments and their relations for computational argumentation tasks. However, many must simplify semantic types to fit specific schemas, thus losing flexibility and expression ability. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical Argumentation Graph (Hi-ArG), a new structure to organize arguments. We also introduce two approaches to exploit Hi-ArG, including a text-graph multi-modal model GreaseArG and a new pre-training framework augmented with graph information. Experiments on two argumentation tasks have shown that after further pre-training and fine-tuning, GreaseArG supersedes same-scale language models on these tasks, while incorporating graph information during further pre-training can also improve the performance of vanilla language models.

Chain-of-Thought Tuning: Masked Language Models can also Think Step By Step in Natural Language Understanding\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical multi-scale processing in language models\"*\n\n*Caoyun Fan, Jidong Tian, Yitian Li, Wenqing Chen, Hao He, Yaohui Jin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Chain-of-Thought Tuning (CoTT), a two-step reasoning framework based on prompt tuning, to implement step-by-step thinking for MLMs on NLU tasks, and shows that CoTT outperforms baselines and achieves state- of-the-art performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a technique that guides Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose complex tasks into multi-step reasoning through intermediate steps in natural language form. Briefly, CoT enables LLMs to think step by step. However, although many Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks also require thinking step by step, LLMs perform less well than small-scale Masked Language Models (MLMs). To migrate CoT from LLMs to MLMs, we propose Chain-of-Thought Tuning (CoTT), a two-step reasoning framework based on prompt tuning, to implement step-by-step thinking for MLMs on NLU tasks. From the perspective of CoT, CoTT's two-step framework enables MLMs to implement task decomposition; CoTT's prompt tuning allows intermediate steps to be used in natural language form. Thereby, the success of CoT can be extended to NLU tasks through MLMs. To verify the effectiveness of CoTT, we conduct experiments on two NLU tasks: hierarchical classification and relation extraction, and the results show that CoTT outperforms baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Performance of models in prior art is evaluated with standard precision, recall, and F1 measures without regard for the rich hierarchical structure. In this work we argue for hierarchical evaluation of the predictions of neural LMTC models. With the example of the ICD-9 ontology we describe a structural issue in the representation of the structured label space in prior art, and propose an alternative representation based on the depth of the ontology. We propose a set of metrics for hierarchical evaluation using the depth-based representation. We compare the evaluation scores from the proposed metrics with previously used metrics on prior art LMTC models for ICD-9 coding in MIMIC-III.

Interpretable Sentence Representation with Variational Autoencoders and\n  Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"control variates in transformer attention\"*\n\n*Ghazi Felhi*\n\n**Abstract:** In this thesis, we develop methods to enhance the interpretability of recent\nrepresentation learning techniques in natural language processing (NLP) while\naccounting for the unavailability of annotated data. We choose to leverage\nVariational Autoencoders (VAEs) due to their efficiency in relating\nobservations to latent generative factors and their effectiveness in\ndata-efficient learning and interpretable representation learning. As a first\ncontribution, we identify and remove unnecessary components in the functioning\nscheme of semi-supervised VAEs making them faster, smaller and easier to\ndesign. Our second and main contribution is to use VAEs and Transformers to\nbuild two models with inductive bias to separate information in latent\nrepresentations into understandable concepts without annotated data. The first\nmodel, Attention-Driven VAE (ADVAE), is able to separately represent and\ncontrol information about syntactic roles in sentences. The second model,\nQKVAE, uses separate latent variables to form keys and values for its\nTransformer decoder and is able to separate syntactic and semantic information\nin its neural representations. In transfer experiments, QKVAE has competitive\nperformance compared to supervised models and equivalent performance to a\nsupervised model using 50K annotated samples. Additionally, QKVAE displays\nimproved syntactic role disentanglement capabilities compared to ADVAE.\nOverall, we demonstrate that it is possible to enhance the interpretability of\nstate-of-the-art deep learning architectures for language modeling with\nunannotated data in situations where text data is abundant but annotations are\nscarce.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-04T13:16:15Z  (*Updated: 2023-05-04T13:16:15Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. A Variational AutoEncoder for Transformers with Nonparametric\n  Variational Information Bottleneck\n\n*From Search Query: \"control variates in transformer attention\"*\n\n*James Henderson, Fabio Fehr*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a VAE for Transformers by developing a variational information\nbottleneck regulariser for Transformer embeddings. We formalise the embedding\nspace of Transformer encoders as mixture probability distributions, and use\nBayesian nonparametrics to derive a nonparametric variational information\nbottleneck (NVIB) for such attention-based embeddings. The variable number of\nmixture components supported by nonparametric methods captures the variable\nnumber of vectors supported by attention, and the exchangeability of our\nnonparametric distributions captures the permutation invariance of attention.\nThis allows NVIB to regularise the number of vectors accessible with attention,\nas well as the amount of information in individual vectors. By regularising the\ncross-attention of a Transformer encoder-decoder with NVIB, we propose a\nnonparametric variational autoencoder (NVAE). Initial experiments on training a\nNVAE on natural language text show that the induced embedding space has the\ndesired properties of a VAE for Transformers.\n\n**Published:** 2022-07-27T13:59:23Z  (*Updated: 2022-08-12T16:57:26Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector\n  Retrieval\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparsity attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly\nimportant. However, due to the quadratic time complexity of attention\ncomputation, scaling LLMs to longer contexts incurs extremely slow inference\nlatency and high GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors.\nThis paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to both\naccelerate attention computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. By\nleveraging the dynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention\nproposes to use approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV\nvectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most relevant ones with vector search\nduring generation. Unfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS\nindexes are often ineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the\nout-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors in attention\nmechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an\nattention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of\nquery vectors. Our evaluation shows that RetrievalAttention only needs to\naccess 1--3% of data while maintaining high model accuracy. This leads to\nsignificant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs with much\nlower GPU memory footprint. In particular, RetrievalAttention only needs a\nsingle NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB) for serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B\nparameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-16T17:59:52Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-18T13:11:13Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. A Hierarchical Transformer for Unsupervised Parsing\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical multi-scale processing in language models\"*\n\n*Ashok Thillaisundaram*\n\n**Abstract:** The underlying structure of natural language is hierarchical; words combine\ninto phrases, which in turn form clauses. An awareness of this hierarchical\nstructure can aid machine learning models in performing many linguistic tasks.\nHowever, most such models just process text sequentially and there is no bias\ntowards learning hierarchical structure encoded into their architecture. In\nthis paper, we extend the recent transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) by\nenabling it to learn hierarchical representations. To achieve this, we adapt\nthe ordering mechanism introduced in Shen et al., 2018, to the self-attention\nmodule of the transformer architecture.

HiReview: Hierarchical Taxonomy-Driven Automatic Literature Review\n  Generation\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical multi-scale processing in language models\"*\n\n*Yuntong Hu, Zhuofeng Li, Zheng Zhang, Chen Ling, Raasikh Kanjiani, Boxin Zhao, Liang Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we present HiReview, a novel framework for hierarchical\ntaxonomy-driven automatic literature review generation. With the exponential\ngrowth of academic documents, manual literature reviews have become\nincreasingly labor-intensive and time-consuming, while traditional\nsummarization models struggle to generate comprehensive document reviews\neffectively. Large language models (LLMs), with their powerful text processing\ncapabilities, offer a potential solution; however, research on incorporating\nLLMs for automatic document generation remains limited. To address key\nchallenges in large-scale automatic literature review generation (LRG), we\npropose a two-stage taxonomy-then-generation approach that combines graph-based\nhierarchical clustering with retrieval-augmented LLMs. First, we retrieve the\nmost relevant sub-community within the citation network, then generate a\nhierarchical taxonomy tree by clustering papers based on both textual content\nand citation relationships. In the second stage, an LLM generates coherent and\ncontextually accurate summaries for clusters or topics at each hierarchical\nlevel, ensuring comprehensive coverage and logical organization of the\nliterature. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiReview significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior hierarchical\norganization, content relevance, and factual accuracy in automatic literature\nreview generation tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-02T13:02:03Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-02T13:02:03Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Comparative Study of Large Language Model Architectures on Frontier\n\n*From Search Query: \"control variates in transformer attention\"*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in both the AI community and beyond. Among these, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) has emerged as the dominant architecture, spawning numerous variants. However, these variants have undergone pre-training under diverse conditions, including variations in input data, data preprocessing, and training methodologies, resulting in a lack of controlled comparative studies. Here we meticulously examine two prominent open-sourced GPT architectures, GPT-NeoX and LLaMA, leveraging the computational power of Frontier, the world's first Exascale supercomputer. Employing the same materials science text corpus and a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline, we conduct a comparative analysis of their training and downstream performance. Our efforts culminate in achieving state-of-the-art performance on a challenging materials science benchmark. Furthermore, we investigate the computation and energy efficiency, and propose a computationally efficient method for architecture design. To our knowledge, these pre-trained models represent the largest available for materials science. Our findings provide practical guidance for building LLMs on HPC platforms.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. MuseMorphose: Full-Song and Fine-Grained Piano Music Style Transfer with One Transformer VAE\n\n*From Search Query: \"control variates in transformer attention\"*\n\n*Yi-Hsuan Yang, Shih-Lun Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers and variational autoencoders (VAE) have been extensively employed for symbolic (e.g., MIDI) domain music generation. While the former boast an impressive capability in modeling long sequences, the latter allow users to willingly exert control over different parts (e.g., bars) of the music to be generated. In this paper, we are interested in bringing the two together to construct a single model that exhibits both strengths. The task is split into two steps. First, we equip Transformer decoders with the ability to accept segment-level, time-varying conditions during sequence generation. Subsequently, we combine the developed and tested in-attention decoder with a Transformer encoder, and train the resulting MuseMorphose model with the VAE objective to achieve style transfer of long pop piano pieces, in which users can specify musical attributes including rhythmic intensity and polyphony (i.e., harmonic fullness) they desire, down to the bar level. Experiments show that MuseMorphose outperforms recurrent neural network (RNN) based baselines on numerous widely-used metrics for style transfer tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-10\n\n\n\n#### 3. Adaptively Sparse Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparsity attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Andr\u00e9 F. T. Martins, Gon\u00e7alo M. Correia, Vlad Niculae*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanisms have become ubiquitous in NLP. Recent architectures, notably the Transformer, learn powerful context-aware word representations through layered, multi-headed attention. The multiple heads learn diverse types of word relationships. However, with standard softmax attention, all attention heads are dense, assigning a non-zero weight to all context words. In this work, we introduce the adaptively sparse Transformer, wherein attention heads have flexible, context-dependent sparsity patterns. This sparsity is accomplished by replacing softmax with $\\alpha$-entmax: a differentiable generalization of softmax that allows low-scoring words to receive precisely zero weight. Moreover, we derive a method to automatically learn the $\\alpha$ parameter -- which controls the shape and sparsity of $\\alpha$-entmax -- allowing attention heads to choose between focused or spread-out behavior. Our adaptively sparse Transformer improves interpretability and head diversity when compared to softmax Transformers on machine translation datasets. Findings of the quantitative and qualitative analysis of our approach include that heads in different layers learn different sparsity preferences and tend to be more diverse in their attention distributions than softmax Transformers. Furthermore, at no cost in accuracy, sparsity in attention heads helps to uncover different head specializations.\n\n**Conference:** adaptively-sparse-transformers-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-08-30\n\n\n\n#### 4. MindSearch: Mimicking Human Minds Elicits Deep AI Searcher\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical multi-scale processing in language models\"*\n\n*Feng Zhao, Kai Chen, Wenwei Zhang, Jiangning Liu, Qiuchen Wang, Kuikun Liu, Zehui Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Information seeking and integration is a complex cognitive task that consumes enormous time and effort. Inspired by the remarkable progress of Large Language Models, recent works attempt to solve this task by combining LLMs and search engines. However, these methods still obtain unsatisfying performance due to three challenges: (1) complex requests often cannot be accurately and completely retrieved by the search engine once (2) corresponding information to be integrated is spread over multiple web pages along with massive noise, and (3) a large number of web pages with long contents may quickly exceed the maximum context length of LLMs. Inspired by the cognitive process when humans solve these problems, we introduce MindSearch to mimic the human minds in web information seeking and integration, which can be instantiated by a simple yet effective LLM-based multi-agent framework. The WebPlanner models the human mind of multi-step information seeking as a dynamic graph construction process: it decomposes the user query into atomic sub-questions as nodes in the graph and progressively extends the graph based on the search result from WebSearcher. Tasked with each sub-question, WebSearcher performs hierarchical information retrieval with search engines and collects valuable information for WebPlanner. The multi-agent design of MindSearch enables the whole framework to seek and integrate information parallelly from larger-scale (e.g., more than 300) web pages in 3 minutes, which is worth 3 hours of human effort. MindSearch demonstrates significant improvement in the response quality in terms of depth and breadth, on both close-set and open-set QA problems. Besides, responses from MindSearch based on InternLM2.5-7B are preferable by humans to ChatGPT-Web and Perplexity.ai applications, which implies that MindSearch can already deliver a competitive solution to the proprietary AI search engine.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-29\n\n\n\n#### 5. Qwen2-Audio Technical Report\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical multi-scale processing in language models\"*\n\n*Jingren Zhou, Chang Zhou, Junyang Lin, Jinzheng He, YuanJun Lv, Yichong Leng, Zhifang Guo, Xipin Wei, Haojie Wei, Qian Yang, Jin Xu, Yunfei Chu*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce the latest progress of Qwen-Audio, a large-scale audio-language model called Qwen2-Audio, which is capable of accepting various audio signal inputs and performing audio analysis or direct textual responses with regard to speech instructions. In contrast to complex hierarchical tags, we have simplified the pre-training process by utilizing natural language prompts for different data and tasks, and have further expanded the data volume. We have boosted the instruction-following capability of Qwen2-Audio and implemented two distinct audio interaction modes for voice chat and audio analysis. In the voice chat mode, users can freely engage in voice interactions with Qwen2-Audio without text input. In the audio analysis mode, users could provide audio and text instructions for analysis during the interaction. Note that we do not use any system prompts to switch between voice chat and audio analysis modes. Qwen2-Audio is capable of intelligently comprehending the content within audio and following voice commands to respond appropriately. For instance, in an audio segment that simultaneously contains sounds, multi-speaker conversations, and a voice command, Qwen2-Audio can directly understand the command and provide an interpretation and response to the audio. Additionally, DPO has optimized the model's performance in terms of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. According to the evaluation results from AIR-Bench, Qwen2-Audio outperformed previous SOTAs, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, in tests focused on audio-centric instruction-following capabilities. Qwen2-Audio is open-sourced with the aim of fostering the advancement of the multi-modal language community.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, focusing on efficiency, scalability, and adaptability, here are the key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n### Control Variates in Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The use of control variates in attention mechanisms is crucial for reducing variance in attention approximations, which can enhance training stability and inference efficiency.

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

Hofmann, Chris J. Maddison, Daniel M. Roy*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work studies the covariance matrix of a modified Softmax-based attention model with skip connections in the proportional limit of infinite-depth-and-width, and shows that at initialization the limiting distribution can be described by a stochastic differential equation indexed by the depth-to-width ratio.\n\n**Abstract:** In deep learning theory, the covariance matrix of the representations serves as a proxy to examine the network's trainability. Motivated by the success of Transformers, we study the covariance matrix of a modified Softmax-based attention model with skip connections in the proportional limit of infinite-depth-and-width. We show that at initialization the limiting distribution can be described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) indexed by the depth-to-width ratio. To achieve a well-defined stochastic limit, the Transformer's attention mechanism is modified by centering the Softmax output at identity, and scaling the Softmax logits by a width-dependent temperature parameter. We examine the stability of the network through the corresponding SDE, showing how the scale of both the drift and diffusion can be elegantly controlled with the aid of residual connections. The existence of a stable SDE implies that the covariance structure is well-behaved, even for very large depth and width, thus preventing the notorious issues of rank degeneracy in deep attention models. Finally, we show, through simulations, that the SDE provides a surprisingly good description of the corresponding finite-size model. We coin the name shaped Transformer for these architectural modifications.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. CtrlFormer: Learning Transferable State Representation for Visual Control via Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: \"control variates transformer attention\"*\n\n*Yao Mu, Shoufa Chen, Mingyu Ding, Jianyu Chen, Runjian Chen, Ping Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel Control Transformer (CtrlFormer), possessing many appealing benefits that prior arts do not have, and carefully design a contrastive reinforcement learning paradigm to train CtrlFormer, enabling it to achieve high sample efficiency, which is important in control problems.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer has achieved great successes in learning vision and language representation, which is general across various downstream tasks. In visual control, learning transferable state representation that can transfer between different control tasks is important to reduce the training sample size. However, porting Transformer to sample-efficient visual control remains a challenging and unsolved problem. To this end, we propose a novel Control Transformer (CtrlFormer), possessing many appealing benefits that prior arts do not have. Firstly, CtrlFormer jointly learns self-attention mechanisms between visual tokens and policy tokens among different control tasks, where multitask representation can be learned and transferred without catastrophic forgetting. Secondly, we carefully design a contrastive reinforcement learning paradigm to train CtrlFormer, enabling it to achieve high sample efficiency, which is important in control problems. For example, in the DMControl benchmark, unlike recent advanced methods that failed by producing a zero score in the\"Cartpole\"task after transfer learning with 100k samples, CtrlFormer can achieve a state-of-the-art score with only 100k samples while maintaining the performance of previous tasks.

Rush*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experiments show that when pruning large pretrained language models, movement pruning shows significant improvements in high-sparsity regimes and when combined with distillation, the approach achieves minimal accuracy loss with down to only 3% of the model parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Magnitude pruning is a widely used strategy for reducing model size in pure supervised learning; however, it is less effective in the transfer learning regime that has become standard for state-of-the-art natural language processing applications. We propose the use of movement pruning, a simple, deterministic first-order weight pruning method that is more adaptive to pretrained model fine-tuning. We give mathematical foundations to the method and compare it to existing zeroth- and first-order pruning methods. Experiments show that when pruning large pretrained language models, movement pruning shows significant improvements in high-sparsity regimes. When combined with distillation, the approach achieves minimal accuracy loss with down to only 3% of the model parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 415  (*Influential: 70*)\n\n#### 5. Boost Transformer-based Language Models with GPU-Friendly Sparsity and Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparsity transformer\"*\n\n*Chong Yu, Tao Chen, Zhongxue Gan*\n\n**TL;DR:** GPUSQ-TLM scheme achieves state-of-the-art compression on TLM model of various encoder and de-coder blocks with negligible accuracy degradation on SQuAD, GLUE, CNN-DM & XSum and WikiText benchmarking tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Along with the performance improvement in NLP domain, the sizes of transformer-based language models ( TLM ) are also dramatically increased. Some prior works intend to compress TLM models into more compact forms, but do not fully consider the hardware characters may not support the efficient execution for these forms, leading to the deployment of TLM on hardware with noticeable acceleration is still challenging. This paper thoroughly designs a compression scheme named GPUSQ-TLM to maximally utilize the GPU-friendly 2:4 fine-grained structured sparsity and quantization characters . Especially, a dense TLM model is first pruned to meet the GPU\u2019s acceleration constraint of sparse patterns with FP16 type, then it is further quantized into a fixed-point one by quantization-aware training, to provide an extra speedup for integer tensors on GPU. A mixed-strategy knowledge distillation of labels, logits and feature maps is used for best accuracy compensation during pruning and quantization process. Experiment results show GPUSQ-TLM scheme achieves state-of-the-art compression on TLM model of various encoder and de-coder blocks with negligible accuracy degradation on SQuAD, GLUE, CNN-DM & XSum and WikiText benchmarking tasks. Moreover, GPUSQ-TLM can boost actual deployment performance by up to 4.08-4.25 \u00d7 times latency and 6.18-6.79 \u00d7 throughput on A100 GPU.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Point-M2AE: Multi-scale Masked Autoencoders for Hierarchical Point Cloud Pre-training\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical multi-scale transformer\"*\n\n*Renrui Zhang, Ziyu Guo, Peng Gao, Rongyao Fang, Bingyan Zhao, Dong Wang, Y. Qiao, Hongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Point-M2AE is proposed, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds that modifications the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of3D shapes.\n\n**Abstract:** Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown great potentials in self-supervised pre-training for language and 2D image transformers. However, it still remains an open question on how to exploit masked autoencoding for learning 3D representations of irregular point clouds. In this paper, we propose Point-M2AE, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds. Unlike the standard transformer in MAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of 3D shapes. For the encoder that downsamples point tokens by stages, we design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate consistent visible regions across scales, and adopt a local spatial self-attention mechanism during fine-tuning to focus on neighboring patterns. By multi-scale token propagation, the lightweight decoder gradually upsamples point tokens with complementary skip connections from the encoder, which further promotes the reconstruction from a global-to-local perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Point-M2AE for 3D representation learning. With a frozen encoder after pre-training, Point-M2AE achieves 92.9% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, even surpassing some fully trained methods. By fine-tuning on downstream tasks, Point-M2AE achieves 86.43% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, +3.36% to the second-best, and largely benefits the few-shot classification, part segmentation and 3D object detection with the hierarchical pre-training scheme.

A Hierarchical Spatial Transformer for Massive Point Samples in Continuous Space\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical multi-scale transformer\"*\n\n*Wenchong He, Zhe Jiang, Tingsong Xiao, Zelin Xu, Shigang Chen, Ronald Fick, Miles Medina, Christine Angelini*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new hierarchical spatial transformer model which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation is proposed, which outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are widely used deep learning architectures. Existing transformers are mostly designed for sequences (texts or time series), images or videos, and graphs. This paper proposes a novel transformer model for massive (up to a million) point samples in continuous space. Such data are ubiquitous in environment sciences (e.g., sensor observations), numerical simulations (e.g., particle-laden flow, astrophysics), and location-based services (e.g., POIs and trajectories). However, designing a transformer for massive spatial points is non-trivial due to several challenges, including implicit long-range and multi-scale dependency on irregular points in continuous space, a non-uniform point distribution, the potential high computational costs of calculating all-pair attention across massive points, and the risks of over-confident predictions due to varying point density. To address these challenges, we propose a new hierarchical spatial transformer model, which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation. We also design an uncertainty quantification branch to estimate prediction confidence related to input feature noise and point sparsity. We provide a theoretical analysis of computational time complexity and memory costs. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and our model can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.

Hierarchical Neural Operator Transformer with Learnable Frequency-aware Loss Prior for Arbitrary-scale Super-resolution\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical multi-scale transformer\"*\n\n*Xihaier Luo, Xiaoning Qian, Byung-Jun Yoon*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we present an arbitrary-scale super-resolution (SR) method to enhance the resolution of scientific data, which often involves complex challenges such as continuity, multi-scale physics, and the intricacies of high-frequency signals. Grounded in operator learning, the proposed method is resolution-invariant. The core of our model is a hierarchical neural operator that leverages a Galerkin-type self-attention mechanism, enabling efficient learning of mappings between function spaces. Sinc filters are used to facilitate the information transfer across different levels in the hierarchy, thereby ensuring representation equivalence in the proposed neural operator. Additionally, we introduce a learnable prior structure that is derived from the spectral resizing of the input data. This loss prior is model-agnostic and is designed to dynamically adjust the weighting of pixel contributions, thereby balancing gradients effectively across the model. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse datasets from different domains and demonstrate consistent improvements compared to strong baselines, which consist of various state-of-the-art SR methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Interpretable Sentence Representation with Variational Autoencoders and\n  Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"control variates transformer attention\"*\n\n*Ghazi Felhi*\n\n**Abstract:** In this thesis, we develop methods to enhance the interpretability of recent\nrepresentation learning techniques in natural language processing (NLP) while\naccounting for the unavailability of annotated data. We choose to leverage\nVariational Autoencoders (VAEs) due to their efficiency in relating\nobservations to latent generative factors and their effectiveness in\ndata-efficient learning and interpretable representation learning. As a first\ncontribution, we identify and remove unnecessary components in the functioning\nscheme of semi-supervised VAEs making them faster, smaller and easier to\ndesign. Our second and main contribution is to use VAEs and Transformers to\nbuild two models with inductive bias to separate information in latent\nrepresentations into understandable concepts without annotated data. The first\nmodel, Attention-Driven VAE (ADVAE), is able to separately represent and\ncontrol information about syntactic roles in sentences. The second model,\nQKVAE, uses separate latent variables to form keys and values for its\nTransformer decoder and is able to separate syntactic and semantic information\nin its neural representations. In transfer experiments, QKVAE has competitive\nperformance compared to supervised models and equivalent performance to a\nsupervised model using 50K annotated samples. Additionally, QKVAE displays\nimproved syntactic role disentanglement capabilities compared to ADVAE.\nOverall, we demonstrate that it is possible to enhance the interpretability of\nstate-of-the-art deep learning architectures for language modeling with\nunannotated data in situations where text data is abundant but annotations are\nscarce.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-04T13:16:15Z  (*Updated: 2023-05-04T13:16:15Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. A Variational AutoEncoder for Transformers with Nonparametric\n  Variational Information Bottleneck\n\n*From Search Query: \"control variates transformer attention\"*\n\n*James Henderson, Fabio Fehr*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a VAE for Transformers by developing a variational information\nbottleneck regulariser for Transformer embeddings. We formalise the embedding\nspace of Transformer encoders as mixture probability distributions, and use\nBayesian nonparametrics to derive a nonparametric variational information\nbottleneck (NVIB) for such attention-based embeddings. The variable number of\nmixture components supported by nonparametric methods captures the variable\nnumber of vectors supported by attention, and the exchangeability of our\nnonparametric distributions captures the permutation invariance of attention.\nThis allows NVIB to regularise the number of vectors accessible with attention,\nas well as the amount of information in individual vectors. By regularising the\ncross-attention of a Transformer encoder-decoder with NVIB, we propose a\nnonparametric variational autoencoder (NVAE). Initial experiments on training a\nNVAE on natural language text show that the induced embedding space has the\ndesired properties of a VAE for Transformers.\n\n**Published:** 2022-07-27T13:59:23Z  (*Updated: 2022-08-12T16:57:26Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Specifically, we study attention spans, sparse, and\nstructured dropout methods to help understand how their attention mechanism\nextends for vision and language tasks.

RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector\n  Retrieval\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparsity transformer\"*\n\n*Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly\nimportant. However, due to the quadratic time complexity of attention\ncomputation, scaling LLMs to longer contexts incurs extremely slow inference\nlatency and high GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors.\nThis paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to both\naccelerate attention computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. By\nleveraging the dynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention\nproposes to use approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV\nvectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most relevant ones with vector search\nduring generation. Unfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS\nindexes are often ineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the\nout-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors in attention\nmechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an\nattention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of\nquery vectors. Our evaluation shows that RetrievalAttention only needs to\naccess 1--3% of data while maintaining high model accuracy. This leads to\nsignificant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs with much\nlower GPU memory footprint. In particular, RetrievalAttention only needs a\nsingle NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB) for serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B\nparameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-16T17:59:52Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-18T13:11:13Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Smith, Navin Goyal, Yulia Tsvetkov*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers trained on natural language data have been shown to learn its\nhierarchical structure and generalize to sentences with unseen syntactic\nstructures without explicitly encoding any structural bias. In this work, we\ninvestigate sources of inductive bias in transformer models and their training\nthat could cause such generalization behavior to emerge. We extensively\nexperiment with transformer models trained on multiple synthetic datasets and\nwith different training objectives and show that while other objectives e.g.\nsequence-to-sequence modeling, prefix language modeling, often failed to lead\nto hierarchical generalization, models trained with the language modeling\nobjective consistently learned to generalize hierarchically. We then conduct\npruning experiments to study how transformers trained with the language\nmodeling objective encode hierarchical structure. When pruned, we find joint\nexistence of subnetworks within the model with different generalization\nbehaviors (subnetworks corresponding to hierarchical structure and linear\norder). Finally, we take a Bayesian perspective to further uncover\ntransformers' preference for hierarchical generalization: We establish a\ncorrelation between whether transformers generalize hierarchically on a dataset\nand whether the simplest explanation of that dataset is provided by a\nhierarchical grammar compared to regular grammars exhibiting linear\ngeneralization.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-25T07:10:29Z  (*Updated: 2024-05-31T23:47:15Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6.

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to\nproduce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or\nwell-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are\nimpressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their\napplications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit\nhierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle\nlong sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to\ndownsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them\nhierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to\ncreate Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass\nimproves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and\ncan yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular,\nHourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32\ngeneration task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied\nenwik8 benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-26T14:00:49Z  (*Updated: 2022-04-16T20:47:45Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Comparative Study of Large Language Model Architectures on Frontier\n\n*From Search Query: \"control variates transformer attention\"*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in both the AI community and beyond. Among these, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) has emerged as the dominant architecture, spawning numerous variants. However, these variants have undergone pre-training under diverse conditions, including variations in input data, data preprocessing, and training methodologies, resulting in a lack of controlled comparative studies. Here we meticulously examine two prominent open-sourced GPT architectures, GPT-NeoX and LLaMA, leveraging the computational power of Frontier, the world's first Exascale supercomputer. Employing the same materials science text corpus and a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline, we conduct a comparative analysis of their training and downstream performance. Our efforts culminate in achieving state-of-the-art performance on a challenging materials science benchmark. Furthermore, we investigate the computation and energy efficiency, and propose a computationally efficient method for architecture design. To our knowledge, these pre-trained models represent the largest available for materials science. Our findings provide practical guidance for building LLMs on HPC platforms.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. MuseMorphose: Full-Song and Fine-Grained Piano Music Style Transfer with One Transformer VAE\n\n*From Search Query: \"control variates transformer attention\"*\n\n*Yi-Hsuan Yang, Shih-Lun Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers and variational autoencoders (VAE) have been extensively employed for symbolic (e.g., MIDI) domain music generation. While the former boast an impressive capability in modeling long sequences, the latter allow users to willingly exert control over different parts (e.g., bars) of the music to be generated. In this paper, we are interested in bringing the two together to construct a single model that exhibits both strengths. The task is split into two steps. First, we equip Transformer decoders with the ability to accept segment-level, time-varying conditions during sequence generation. Subsequently, we combine the developed and tested in-attention decoder with a Transformer encoder, and train the resulting MuseMorphose model with the VAE objective to achieve style transfer of long pop piano pieces, in which users can specify musical attributes including rhythmic intensity and polyphony (i.e., harmonic fullness) they desire, down to the bar level. Experiments show that MuseMorphose outperforms recurrent neural network (RNN) based baselines on numerous widely-used metrics for style transfer tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-10\n\n\n\n#### 3. Transformers meet Stochastic Block Models: Attention with Data-Adaptive Sparsity and Cost\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparsity transformer\"*\n\n*Seunghoon Hong, Honglak Lee, Moontae Lee, Jinwoo Kim, Seonwoo Min, Sungjun Cho*\n\n**Abstract:** To overcome the quadratic cost of self-attention, recent works have proposed various sparse attention modules, most of which fall under one of two groups: 1) sparse attention under a hand-crafted patterns and 2) full attention followed by a sparse variant of softmax such as $\\alpha$-entmax. Unfortunately, the first group lacks adaptability to data while the second still requires quadratic cost in training. In this work, we propose SBM-Transformer, a model that resolves both problems by endowing each attention head with a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM). Then, each attention head data-adaptively samples a bipartite graph, the adjacency of which is used as an attention mask for each input. During backpropagation, a straight-through estimator is used to flow gradients beyond the discrete sampling step and adjust the probabilities of sampled edges based on the predictive loss. The forward and backward cost are thus linear to the number of edges, which each attention head can also choose flexibly based on the input. By assessing the distribution of graphs, we theoretically show that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation. Empirical evaluations under the LRA and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention. Our implementation can be found in https://github.com/sc782/SBM-Transformer .\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-27\n\n\n\n#### 4. Adaptively Sparse Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparsity transformer\"*\n\n*Andr\u00e9 F. T. Martins, Gon\u00e7alo M. Correia, Vlad Niculae*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanisms have become ubiquitous in NLP. Recent architectures, notably the Transformer, learn powerful context-aware word representations through layered, multi-headed attention. The multiple heads learn diverse types of word relationships. However, with standard softmax attention, all attention heads are dense, assigning a non-zero weight to all context words. In this work, we introduce the adaptively sparse Transformer, wherein attention heads have flexible, context-dependent sparsity patterns. This sparsity is accomplished by replacing softmax with $\\alpha$-entmax: a differentiable generalization of softmax that allows low-scoring words to receive precisely zero weight. Moreover, we derive a method to automatically learn the $\\alpha$ parameter -- which controls the shape and sparsity of $\\alpha$-entmax -- allowing attention heads to choose between focused or spread-out behavior. Our adaptively sparse Transformer improves interpretability and head diversity when compared to softmax Transformers on machine translation datasets. Findings of the quantitative and qualitative analysis of our approach include that heads in different layers learn different sparsity preferences and tend to be more diverse in their attention distributions than softmax Transformers. Furthermore, at no cost in accuracy, sparsity in attention heads helps to uncover different head specializations.\n\n**Conference:** adaptively-sparse-transformers-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-08-30\n\n\n\n#### 5. HiFormer: Hierarchical Multi-scale Representations Using Transformers for Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical multi-scale transformer\"*\n\n*Dorit Merhof, Julien Cohen-Adad, Ehsan Khodapanah Aghdam, Reza Azad, Milad Soltany, Amirhossein Kazerouni, Moein Heidari*\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been the consensus for medical image segmentation tasks. However, they suffer from the limitation in modeling long-range dependencies and spatial correlations due to the nature of convolution operation. Although transformers were first developed to address this issue, they fail to capture low-level features. In contrast, it is demonstrated that both local and global features are crucial for dense prediction, such as segmenting in challenging contexts. In this paper, we propose HiFormer, a novel method that efficiently bridges a CNN and a transformer for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we design two multi-scale feature representations using the seminal Swin Transformer module and a CNN-based encoder. To secure a fine fusion of global and local features obtained from the two aforementioned representations, we propose a Double-Level Fusion (DLF) module in the skip connection of the encoder-decoder structure. Extensive experiments on various medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HiFormer over other CNN-based, transformer-based, and hybrid methods in terms of computational complexity, and quantitative and qualitative results.

Multi-scale Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Cascaded Attention Decoding for Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical multi-scale transformer\"*\n\n*Radu Marculescu, Md Mostafijur Rahman*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have shown great success in medical image segmentation. However, transformers may exhibit a limited generalization ability due to the underlying single-scale self-attention (SA) mechanism. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a Multi-scale hiERarchical vIsion Transformer (MERIT) backbone network, which improves the generalizability of the model by computing SA at multiple scales. We also incorporate an attention-based decoder, namely Cascaded Attention Decoding (CASCADE), for further refinement of multi-stage features generated by MERIT. Finally, we introduce an effective multi-stage feature mixing loss aggregation (MUTATION) method for better model training via implicit ensembling. Our experiments on two widely used medical image segmentation benchmarks (i.e., Synapse Multi-organ, ACDC) demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT over state-of-the-art methods. Our MERIT architecture and MUTATION loss aggregation can be used with downstream medical image and semantic segmentation tasks.\n\n**Conference:** multi-scale-hierarchical-vision-transformer\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n ### Goal and Intent of the Researcher\n\nThe researcher aims to develop a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that surpasses existing state-of-the-art models in several key areas:\n- **Efficiency**: Reduce computational and memory overhead.\n- **Scalability**: Handle longer sequences effectively.\n- **Adaptability**: Perform well on varied inputs and tasks.\n- **Performance**: Achieve low perplexity and high accuracy.\n\nThe focus is on integrating advanced techniques such as:\n- **Control Variates in Transformer Attention**: To reduce variance in attention approximations.\n- **Adaptive Sparsity Patterns**: To dynamically allocate attention resources.\n- **Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention**: To capture both local and global dependencies efficiently.\n\n### Key Useful Information\n\n#### Control Variates in Transformer Attention\n\n- The integration of control variates in transformer attention mechanisms is crucial for reducing variance in attention approximations.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Control Variates in Attention Mechanisms:**\n  - Integrating control variates within transformer attention mechanisms effectively reduces variance in attention approximations. This enhancement leads to more stable training dynamics and improved inference efficiency, especially beneficial for long-sequence processing. The variance reduction ensures that attention heads can maintain focus on relevant tokens without being distracted by noise, thereby preserving model accuracy while optimizing computational resources.\n\n- **Adaptive Sparsity Patterns:**\n  - Adaptive sparsity patterns allow transformers to dynamically allocate attention based on the input context. By selectively attending to pertinent tokens, the model reduces unnecessary computations, leading to enhanced efficiency. This dynamic adjustment is crucial for handling extended sequences, where traditional dense attention mechanisms become computationally impractical. Adaptive sparsity also contributes to memory optimization by limiting the attention scope to relevant segments of the input.\n\n- **Hierarchical Multi-Scale Processing:**\n  - Hierarchical multi-scale attention mechanisms decompose the attention process into multiple hierarchical levels, capturing both local and global dependencies efficiently. This structure enhances scalability, enabling the model to process longer sequences without a corresponding increase in computational cost. Hierarchical attention not only improves memory efficiency but also facilitates better modeling of complex dependencies across different granularities of the input data.\n\n- **Synergistic Integration of Techniques:**\n  - Combining control variates with adaptive sparsity within hierarchical multi-scale attention frameworks presents a synergistic approach to optimizing transformer-based models. Control variates enhance the precision of attention approximations, while adaptive sparsity ensures computational resources are focused on relevant tokens. Hierarchical processing further augments these benefits by enabling multi-level attention, thereby creating a comprehensive framework that addresses efficiency, scalability, and adaptability in language modeling.\n\n- **Memory Optimization Strategies:**\n  - Memory-optimized hierarchical attention systems are pivotal for large-scale transformers, as they facilitate handling longer sequences without excessive memory consumption. Techniques such as blockwise computation, selective state integration, and hierarchical structuring ensure that memory usage scales linearly with sequence length, maintaining model performance while optimizing resource utilization.\n\n### 4.

Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg.

It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/52 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00027, 2020.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/30 (Score: 0.24)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2304.07327, 2023.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/62 (Score: 0.18)*\n\n```\n[15] A. Katharopoulos et al.

Sliced Wasserstein Estimation with Control Variates\n\n*From Search Query: control variates variance reduction transformer*\n\n*Khai Nguyen, Nhat Ho*\n\n**TL;DR:** The key idea is to first find Gaussian approximations of projected one-dimensional measures, then utilize the closed-form of the Wasserstein-2 distance between two Gaussian distributions to design the control variates.\n\n**Abstract:** The sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances between two probability measures are defined as the expectation of the Wasserstein distance between two one-dimensional projections of the two measures. The randomness comes from a projecting direction that is used to project the two input measures to one dimension. Due to the intractability of the expectation, Monte Carlo integration is performed to estimate the value of the SW distance. Despite having various variants, there has been no prior work that improves the Monte Carlo estimation scheme for the SW distance in terms of controlling its variance. To bridge the literature on variance reduction and the literature on the SW distance, we propose computationally efficient control variates to reduce the variance of the empirical estimation of the SW distance. The key idea is to first find Gaussian approximations of projected one-dimensional measures, then we utilize the closed-form of the Wasserstein-2 distance between two Gaussian distributions to design the control variates. In particular, we propose using a lower bound and an upper bound of the Wasserstein-2 distance between two fitted Gaussians as two computationally efficient control variates. We empirically show that the proposed control variate estimators can help to reduce the variance considerably when comparing measures over images and point-clouds. Finally, we demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed control variate estimators in gradient flows to interpolate between two point-clouds and in deep generative modeling on standard image datasets, such as CIFAR10 and CelebA.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Vector-Valued Control Variates\n\n*From Search Query: control variates variance reduction transformer*\n\n*Z. Sun, A. Barp, F. Briol*\n\n**Abstract:** Control variates are variance reduction tools for Monte Carlo estimators. They can provide significant variance reduction, but usually require a large number of samples, which can be prohibitive when sampling or evaluating the integrand is computationally expensive. Furthermore, there are many scenarios where we need to compute multiple related integrals simultaneously or sequentially, which can further exacerbate computational costs. In this paper, we propose vector-valued control variates, an extension of control variates which can be used to reduce the variance of multiple Monte Carlo estimators jointly. This allows for the transfer of information across integration tasks, and hence reduces the need for a large number of samples. We focus on control variates based on kernel interpolants and our novel construction is obtained through a generalised Stein identity and the development of novel matrix-valued Stein reproducing kernels. We demonstrate our methodology on a range of problems including multifidelity modelling, Bayesian inference for dynamical systems, and model evidence computation through thermodynamic integration.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

This is achieved by a new proof technique combining ideas from finite-sum optimization and the analysis of sampling methods.

In this work we present a control variate that is applicable for any reparameterizable distribution with known mean and covariance matrix, e.g. Gaussians with any covariance structure.

Stochastic Training of Graph Convolutional Networks with Variance Reduction\n\n*From Search Query: control variates variance reduction transformer*\n\n*Jianfei Chen, Jun Zhu, Le Song*\n\n**TL;DR:** Control variate based algorithms which allow sampling an arbitrarily small neighbor size are developed and a new theoretical guarantee for these algorithms to converge to a local optimum of GCN is proved.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are powerful deep neural networks for graph-structured data. However, GCN computes the representation of a node recursively from its neighbors, making the receptive field size grow exponentially with the number of layers. Previous attempts on reducing the receptive field size by subsampling neighbors do not have a convergence guarantee, and their receptive field size per node is still in the order of hundreds. In this paper, we develop control variate based algorithms which allow sampling an arbitrarily small neighbor size. Furthermore, we prove new theoretical guarantee for our algorithms to converge to a local optimum of GCN. Empirical results show that our algorithms enjoy a similar convergence with the exact algorithm using only two neighbors per node. The runtime of our algorithms on a large Reddit dataset is only one seventh of previous neighbor sampling algorithms.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 462  (*Influential: 68*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on the integration of control variates, variance reduction techniques, and their impact on transformer architectures, here are some relevant points and directions:\n\n## Applications of Control Variates in Transformer Architectures\n\nControl variates are a variance reduction technique often used in Monte Carlo methods.

Researchers could explore how to integrate control variates into the training process of transformers to stabilize and speed up training.\n\n## Variance Reduction Techniques in Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Sparse Attention Mechanisms**: Papers like \"Sparser is Faster\" and \"Dynamic Context Pruning\" discuss efficient sparse attention mechanisms that inherently reduce computational complexity and memory usage. These mechanisms can be seen as variance reduction techniques in the sense that they reduce the noise and inefficiency in attention computations by focusing only on relevant tokens.\n\n## Theoretical Analysis of Variance Reduction Methods\n\n- Theoretical analysis of variance reduction methods, particularly in the context of sparse attention, is crucial. While the provided sources do not delve into the theoretical aspects specifically, future research could focus on analyzing how sparse attention mechanisms theoretically reduce variance. For example, stochastic block models and bi-level routing attention provide data-adaptive sparsity, which can be analyzed for their theoretical guarantees on variance reduction.\n\n## Implementation Details of Control Variate Integration\n\n- To integrate control variates into transformer architectures, researchers would need to design mechanisms that can effectively reduce the variance in gradient estimates. This could involve using control variates to adjust the gradients during backpropagation, ensuring that the updates are more stable and less noisy. However, specific implementation details would require innovative approaches, as this is not a standard practice in current transformer literature.\n\n## Performance Impact of Variance Reduction in Transformers\n\n- The performance impact of variance reduction techniques, such as sparse attention, has been shown to be significant. For example, dynamic context pruning can reduce up to 80% of the context without significant performance degradation, and flash attention extensions can lead to multi-fold runtime speedups.\n- Integrating control variates could potentially further stabilize training and improve the overall performance by reducing the variance in gradient estimates, although this would need to be empirically validated.\n\n### Future Directions\n\nGiven the current state of research:\n\n- **Control Variate Integration**: Investigate how control variates can be integrated into the training process of transformers to reduce variance in gradient estimates.\n- **Memory-Efficient Hierarchical Structures**: Continue exploring memory-efficient implementations of hierarchical structures, such as those discussed in the context of sparse attention and stochastic block models.\n- **Theoretical Analysis**: Conduct a thorough theoretical analysis of variance reduction methods in sparse attention to provide robust guarantees on their effectiveness.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models.\n",

However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/52 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00027, 2020.

However, the improvement strategies for attention mechanisms typically necessitate extensive retraining, which is impractical for large language models with a vast array of parameters. In this paper, we present DiJiang, a novel Frequency Domain Kernelization approach that enables the transformation of a pre-trained vanilla Transformer into a linear complexity model with little training costs. By employing a weighted Quasi-Monte Carlo method for sampling, the proposed approach theoretically offers superior approximation efficiency. To further reduce the training computational complexity, our kernelization is based on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to the original Transformer, but with significantly reduced training costs and much faster inference speeds. Our DiJiang-7B achieves comparable performance with LLaMA2-7B on various benchmark while requires only about 1/50 training cost.

The Shaped Transformer: Attention Models in the Infinite Depth-and-Width Limit\n\n*From Search Query: control variates transformer attention*\n\n*Lorenzo Noci, Chuning Li, Mufan Bill Li, Bobby He, T. Hofmann, Chris J. Maddison, Daniel M. Roy*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work studies the covariance matrix of a modified Softmax-based attention model with skip connections in the proportional limit of infinite-depth-and-width, and shows that at initialization the limiting distribution can be described by a stochastic differential equation indexed by the depth-to-width ratio.\n\n**Abstract:** In deep learning theory, the covariance matrix of the representations serves as a proxy to examine the network's trainability. Motivated by the success of Transformers, we study the covariance matrix of a modified Softmax-based attention model with skip connections in the proportional limit of infinite-depth-and-width. We show that at initialization the limiting distribution can be described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) indexed by the depth-to-width ratio. To achieve a well-defined stochastic limit, the Transformer's attention mechanism is modified by centering the Softmax output at identity, and scaling the Softmax logits by a width-dependent temperature parameter. We examine the stability of the network through the corresponding SDE, showing how the scale of both the drift and diffusion can be elegantly controlled with the aid of residual connections. The existence of a stable SDE implies that the covariance structure is well-behaved, even for very large depth and width, thus preventing the notorious issues of rank degeneracy in deep attention models. Finally, we show, through simulations, that the SDE provides a surprisingly good description of the corresponding finite-size model. We coin the name shaped Transformer for these architectural modifications.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. CtrlFormer: Learning Transferable State Representation for Visual Control via Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: control variates transformer attention*\n\n*Yao Mu, Shoufa Chen, Mingyu Ding, Jianyu Chen, Runjian Chen, Ping Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel Control Transformer (CtrlFormer), possessing many appealing benefits that prior arts do not have, and carefully design a contrastive reinforcement learning paradigm to train CtrlFormer, enabling it to achieve high sample efficiency, which is important in control problems.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer has achieved great successes in learning vision and language representation, which is general across various downstream tasks. In visual control, learning transferable state representation that can transfer between different control tasks is important to reduce the training sample size. However, porting Transformer to sample-efficient visual control remains a challenging and unsolved problem. To this end, we propose a novel Control Transformer (CtrlFormer), possessing many appealing benefits that prior arts do not have. Firstly, CtrlFormer jointly learns self-attention mechanisms between visual tokens and policy tokens among different control tasks, where multitask representation can be learned and transferred without catastrophic forgetting. Secondly, we carefully design a contrastive reinforcement learning paradigm to train CtrlFormer, enabling it to achieve high sample efficiency, which is important in control problems. For example, in the DMControl benchmark, unlike recent advanced methods that failed by producing a zero score in the\"Cartpole\"task after transfer learning with 100k samples, CtrlFormer can achieve a state-of-the-art score with only 100k samples while maintaining the performance of previous tasks.

PIDformer: Transformer Meets Control Theory\n\n*From Search Query: control variates transformer attention*\n\n*Tam Nguyen, C'esar A. Uribe, Tan M. Nguyen, R. Baraniuk*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel class of transformers is derived, PID-controlled Transformer (PIDformer), aimed at improving robustness and mitigating the rank-collapse issue inherent in softmax transformers.\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we address two main shortcomings of transformer architectures: input corruption and rank collapse in their output representation. We unveil self-attention as an autonomous state-space model that inherently promotes smoothness in its solutions, leading to lower-rank outputs and diminished representation capacity. Moreover, the steady-state solution of the model is sensitive to input perturbations. We incorporate a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) closed-loop feedback control system with a reference point into the model to improve robustness and representation capacity. This integration aims to preserve high-frequency details while bolstering model stability, rendering it more noise-resilient. The resulting controlled state-space model is theoretically proven robust and adept at addressing the rank collapse. Motivated by this control framework, we derive a novel class of transformers, PID-controlled Transformer (PIDformer), aimed at improving robustness and mitigating the rank-collapse issue inherent in softmax transformers. We empirically evaluate the model for advantages and robustness against baseline transformers across various practical tasks, including object classification, image segmentation, and language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Preference Transformer: Modeling Human Preferences using Transformers for RL\n\n*From Search Query: control variates transformer attention*\n\n*Changyeon Kim, Jongjin Park, Jinwoo Shin, Honglak Lee, P. Abbeel, Kimin Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a new preference model based on the weighted sum of non-Markovian rewards, a neural architecture that models human preferences using transformers and demonstrates that Preference Transformer can solve a variety of control tasks using real human preferences, while prior approaches fail to work.\n\n**Abstract:** Preference-based reinforcement learning (RL) provides a framework to train agents using human preferences between two behaviors. However, preference-based RL has been challenging to scale since it requires a large amount of human feedback to learn a reward function aligned with human intent. In this paper, we present Preference Transformer, a neural architecture that models human preferences using transformers. Unlike prior approaches assuming human judgment is based on the Markovian rewards which contribute to the decision equally, we introduce a new preference model based on the weighted sum of non-Markovian rewards. We then design the proposed preference model using a transformer architecture that stacks causal and bidirectional self-attention layers. We demonstrate that Preference Transformer can solve a variety of control tasks using real human preferences, while prior approaches fail to work. We also show that Preference Transformer can induce a well-specified reward and attend to critical events in the trajectory by automatically capturing the temporal dependencies in human decision-making.

Comparative Study of Large Language Model Architectures on Frontier\n\n*From Search Query: control variates transformer attention*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in both the AI community and beyond. Among these, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) has emerged as the dominant architecture, spawning numerous variants. However, these variants have undergone pre-training under diverse conditions, including variations in input data, data preprocessing, and training methodologies, resulting in a lack of controlled comparative studies. Here we meticulously examine two prominent open-sourced GPT architectures, GPT-NeoX and LLaMA, leveraging the computational power of Frontier, the world's first Exascale supercomputer. Employing the same materials science text corpus and a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline, we conduct a comparative analysis of their training and downstream performance. Our efforts culminate in achieving state-of-the-art performance on a challenging materials science benchmark. Furthermore, we investigate the computation and energy efficiency, and propose a computationally efficient method for architecture design. To our knowledge, these pre-trained models represent the largest available for materials science. Our findings provide practical guidance for building LLMs on HPC platforms.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. MuseMorphose: Full-Song and Fine-Grained Piano Music Style Transfer with One Transformer VAE\n\n*From Search Query: control variates transformer attention*\n\n*Yi-Hsuan Yang, Shih-Lun Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers and variational autoencoders (VAE) have been extensively employed for symbolic (e.g., MIDI) domain music generation. While the former boast an impressive capability in modeling long sequences, the latter allow users to willingly exert control over different parts (e.g., bars) of the music to be generated. In this paper, we are interested in bringing the two together to construct a single model that exhibits both strengths. The task is split into two steps. First, we equip Transformer decoders with the ability to accept segment-level, time-varying conditions during sequence generation. Subsequently, we combine the developed and tested in-attention decoder with a Transformer encoder, and train the resulting MuseMorphose model with the VAE objective to achieve style transfer of long pop piano pieces, in which users can specify musical attributes including rhythmic intensity and polyphony (i.e., harmonic fullness) they desire, down to the bar level. Experiments show that MuseMorphose outperforms recurrent neural network (RNN) based baselines on numerous widely-used metrics for style transfer tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-10\n\n\n\n#### 3. Vector Quantized Contrastive Predictive Coding for Template-based Music Generation\n\n*From Search Query: control variates transformer attention*\n\n*L\u00e9opold Crestel, Ga\u00ebtan Hadjeres*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we propose a flexible method for generating variations of discrete sequences in which tokens can be grouped into basic units, like sentences in a text or bars in music. More precisely, given a template sequence, we aim at producing novel sequences sharing perceptible similarities with the original template without relying on any annotation; so our problem of generating variations is intimately linked to the problem of learning relevant high-level representations without supervision. Our contribution is two-fold: First, we propose a self-supervised encoding technique, named Vector Quantized Contrastive Predictive Coding which allows to learn a meaningful assignment of the basic units over a discrete set of codes, together with mechanisms allowing to control the information content of these learnt discrete representations. Secondly, we show how these compressed representations can be used to generate variations of a template sequence by using an appropriate attention pattern in the Transformer architecture. We illustrate our approach on the corpus of J.S. Bach chorales where we discuss the musical meaning of the learnt discrete codes and show that our proposed method allows to generate coherent and high-quality variations of a given template.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design by integrating control variates into transformer attention mechanisms, here are some key points and sources that address the specified details:\n\n## Applications of Control Variates in Transformer Attention Mechanisms\n- The concept of using control variates in transformers is relatively new and focused on reducing variance in the attention mechanisms. A relevant paper, \"Efficient Attention via Control Variates in Transformers\" by Zheng et al. (2023), would be a crucial resource. This paper likely discusses how control variates can be applied to attention mechanisms to improve efficiency and stability.\n\n## Variance Reduction Techniques in Neural Networks\n- Control variates are a variance reduction technique that can be applied to neural networks, particularly in the context of Monte Carlo methods. Understanding how these techniques are generally used in neural networks can provide insights into their application in transformers. While the provided sources do not directly discuss this, literature on variance reduction in Monte Carlo methods and their application in deep learning would be beneficial.\n\n## Implementation Details and Efficiency Considerations\n- Implementation details would involve how control variates are integrated into the attention mechanisms, which can affect the computational overhead and memory usage. The paper by Zheng et al. (2023) would likely cover these aspects, including any trade-offs between computational efficiency and memory usage.\n\n## Impact on Training Stability and Convergence\n- The integration of control variates can significantly impact the training stability and convergence of the model. Analyzing how these techniques reduce variance and stabilize the training process is crucial. This aspect would be covered in the detailed analysis of papers like \"Efficient Attention via Control Variates in Transformers\".\n\n## Memory-Computation Trade-offs in Variance Reduction Approaches\n- The trade-offs between memory and computation are critical when implementing variance reduction techniques. Adaptive sparsity patterns, as mentioned in the proposal, also play a role here.

By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 42/46 (Score: 0.79)*\n\n```\n[N/A]\n(b) Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?

This work takes inspiration from a wide array of work on introducing multiple scales of processing into recurrent neural networks (Chung et al. 2016; Hihi \\& Bengio, 1995; Mozer, 1991, Schmidhuber, 1991, Koutn\u00edk et al., 2014). These works divide the processing into multiple streams each operating at a different temporal granularity. While these works mainly focus on recurrent neural networks and their application is mainly on natural language tasks, we focus on introducing multiple streams of processing and a hierarchical structure into Transformers while also focusing on a broader range of domains beyond natural language. Transformers. Some of the components we describe in the proposed model have been used previously in various Transformer models. Transformer XL (Dai et al., 2019) also divides the input into segments. Each segment considers the tokens from the current segment and the previous segment for attention without passing gradients into the previous segments. A number of previous works (Zhang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021b, Wu et al., 2021, Yuan et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021) have worked on introducing a hierarchical structure in Transformers mainly in the domain of vision. The main goal of these works has been to introduce convolution-like hierarchies into Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020). While these works progressively reduce the spatial resolution of the inputs in order to introduce hierarchies, we introduce hierarchies by adding another slow stream of information processing and without reducing the spatial resolution of the inputs. We also provision for the higher level of the hierarchy (i.e. the slow stream) to provide information to the lower levels as top-down conditioning which is not possible in any of the previous works. Top-Down Conditioning. Top-down information is information propagated from higher to lower levels of the network. It represents the models beliefs of the world and provides context for interpreting perceptual information.\n```\n\n#### 2.

The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark. It also sets a new SOTA test perplexity on One-Billion Word dataset with 5x fewer model parameters than that of the previous-best Transformer-based models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/34 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\n(11) and (12) is generally unknown. So gathering empirical evidences seems the only viable path to answer the first question listed above. The ablation studies by (Khandelwal et al., 2018) examine the effect of context words on a language model. Within the context range of about 200 tokens, word order is only relevant within the 20 most recent tokens or about a sentence. In the long-range context, order has almost no effect on performance, suggesting that the model maintains a high-level, rough semantic representation of faraway words. The observation is succinctly summarized by the title of the paper \"sharp nearby, fuzzy far away\". Remarkably, this is in spirit very close to the key insight into the Multilevel Methods. A few recent attention-related studies have explored this direction with some success, such as word-level and sentence-level attentions in (Miculicich et al., 2018; Abreu et al., 2019), and sentence-level and paragraph-level attentions in (Liu and Lapata, 2019). Even though the proposed hierarchical attention in these studies only has two levels, as opposed to ten or more levels typically used by the Multilevel Methods, the reported positive results are quite suggestive. We therefore hypothesize that the same hierarchical low-rank structure as shown in Eq (13) might also hold for the attention matrix in many NLP tasks. And we treat it as the inductive bias in the hierarchical attention mechanism proposed in this paper. As pointed out in (Goyal and Bengio, 2020), inductive biases encourage the learning algorithm to prioritise solutions with certain properties. Hence good benchmark performance delivered by a Transformer-based model with proposed hierarchical attention can be regarded as a positive evidence to support the hierarchical low-rank structure hypothesis. ### 5.2 Informal Exposition of Hierarchical Attention\n\nIn the standard definition of attention in Eq. (3) and (4), there is no preference given to any keys based on the sequence distance between a query and keys. The observation in (Khandelwal et al.,\n2018) clearly suggests that a distance-dependent attention mechanism should be a better alternative. We will take three steps to informally explain the hierarchical attention mechanism. First, the attention matrix blocks for nearby, mid-distance and long-distance attention are separated in section 5.2.1. This is the first step toward the distance-dependent attention mentioned above. Second, a token hierarchy is established in section 5.2.2. Third, the hierarchical attention is constructed in section 5.2.3\n\n### 5.2.1 Attention Partition\n\nConsider a 16-word sentence in Fig. 1. The sentence is partitioned at three segment granularity. This induces a three-level partition of the attention matrix $A$ for the original sequence:\n\n$$\nA=A^{(2)}+A^{(1)}+A^{(0)}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nA^{(2)}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c|c}\n0 & A_{12}^{(2)} \\\\\n\\hline A_{21}^{(2)} & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_a848c33bf30dfbc079beg-05.jpg?height=258&width=600&top_left_y=1539&top_left_x=291)\n\n$$\nA^{(0)}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}\nA_{11}^{(0)} & A_{12}^{(0)} & & & \\\\\n\\hline A_{21}^{(0)} & A_{22}^{(0)} & A_{23}^{(0)} & & \\\\\n\\hline & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\\\\n\\hline & & & A_{87}^{(0)} & A_{88}^{(0)}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNote that the nonzero entries in $A^{(0)}, A^{(1)}$ and $A^{(2)}$ are the same as the corresponding entries of matrix $A$ in Eq.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/34 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\nInternational Conference on Computer AidedDesign, pages 448-455.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.51)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Goldstein, Anima Anandkumar, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 106  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks, and proposes a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains. However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

Point-M2AE: Multi-scale Masked Autoencoders for Hierarchical Point Cloud Pre-training\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical multi scale attention transformer implementation*\n\n*Renrui Zhang, Ziyu Guo, Peng Gao, Rongyao Fang, Bingyan Zhao, Dong Wang, Y. Qiao, Hongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Point-M2AE is proposed, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds that modifications the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of3D shapes.\n\n**Abstract:** Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown great potentials in self-supervised pre-training for language and 2D image transformers. However, it still remains an open question on how to exploit masked autoencoding for learning 3D representations of irregular point clouds. In this paper, we propose Point-M2AE, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds. Unlike the standard transformer in MAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of 3D shapes. For the encoder that downsamples point tokens by stages, we design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate consistent visible regions across scales, and adopt a local spatial self-attention mechanism during fine-tuning to focus on neighboring patterns. By multi-scale token propagation, the lightweight decoder gradually upsamples point tokens with complementary skip connections from the encoder, which further promotes the reconstruction from a global-to-local perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Point-M2AE for 3D representation learning. With a frozen encoder after pre-training, Point-M2AE achieves 92.9% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, even surpassing some fully trained methods. By fine-tuning on downstream tasks, Point-M2AE achieves 86.43% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, +3.36% to the second-best, and largely benefits the few-shot classification, part segmentation and 3D object detection with the hierarchical pre-training scheme.

MICN: Multi-scale Local and Global Context Modeling for Long-term Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical multi scale attention transformer implementation*\n\n*Huiqiang Wang, Jian Peng, Feihu Huang, Jince Wang, Junhui Chen, Yifei Xiao*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels, and is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, Transformer-based methods have achieved surprising performance in the field of long-term series forecasting, but the attention mechanism for computing global correlations entails high complexity. And they do not allow for targeted modeling of local features as CNN structures do. To solve the above problems, we propose to combine local features and global correlations to capture the overall view of time series (e.g., fluctuations, trends). To fully exploit the underlying information in the time series, a multi-scale branch structure is adopted to model different potential patterns separately. Each pattern is extracted with down-sampled convolution and isometric convolution for local features and global correlations, respectively. In addition to being more effective, our proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, MICN yields 17.2% and 21.6% relative improvements for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively.

History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer for Multi-session Open-domain Dialogue System\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical multi scale attention transformer implementation*\n\n*Tong Zhang, Yong Liu, Boyang Albert Li, Zhiwei Zeng, Pengwei Wang, Yuan You, Chun Miao, Li-zhen Cui*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models and human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models.\n\n**Abstract:** With the evolution of pre-trained language models, current open-domain dialogue systems have achieved great progress in conducting one-session conversations. In contrast, Multi-Session Conversation (MSC), which consists of multiple sessions over a long term with the same user, is under-investigated. In this paper, we propose History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer (HAHT) for multi-session open-domain dialogue. HAHT maintains a long-term memory of history conversations and utilizes history information to understand current conversation context and generate well-informed and context-relevant responses. Specifically, HAHT first encodes history conversation sessions hierarchically into a history memory. Then, HAHT leverages historical information to facilitate the understanding of the current conversation context by encoding the history memory together with the current context with attention-based mechanisms. Finally, to explicitly utilize historical information, HAHT uses a history-aware response generator that switches between a generic vocabulary and a history-aware vocabulary. Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models. Human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. A Hierarchical Spatial Transformer for Massive Point Samples in Continuous Space\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical multi scale attention transformer implementation*\n\n*Wenchong He, Zhe Jiang, Tingsong Xiao, Zelin Xu, Shigang Chen, Ronald Fick, Miles Medina, Christine Angelini*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new hierarchical spatial transformer model which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation is proposed, which outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are widely used deep learning architectures. Existing transformers are mostly designed for sequences (texts or time series), images or videos, and graphs. This paper proposes a novel transformer model for massive (up to a million) point samples in continuous space. Such data are ubiquitous in environment sciences (e.g., sensor observations), numerical simulations (e.g., particle-laden flow, astrophysics), and location-based services (e.g., POIs and trajectories). However, designing a transformer for massive spatial points is non-trivial due to several challenges, including implicit long-range and multi-scale dependency on irregular points in continuous space, a non-uniform point distribution, the potential high computational costs of calculating all-pair attention across massive points, and the risks of over-confident predictions due to varying point density. To address these challenges, we propose a new hierarchical spatial transformer model, which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation. We also design an uncertainty quantification branch to estimate prediction confidence related to input feature noise and point sparsity. We provide a theoretical analysis of computational time complexity and memory costs. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and our model can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.

Focal Modulation Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical multi scale attention transformer implementation*\n\n*Jianfeng Gao, Lu Yuan, Xiyang Dai, Chunyuan Li, Jianwei Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose focal modulation networks (FocalNets in short), where self-attention (SA) is completely replaced by a focal modulation mechanism for modeling token interactions in vision. Focal modulation comprises three components: (i) hierarchical contextualization, implemented using a stack of depth-wise convolutional layers, to encode visual contexts from short to long ranges, (ii) gated aggregation to selectively gather contexts for each query token based on its content, and (iii) element-wise modulation or affine transformation to inject the aggregated context into the query. Extensive experiments show FocalNets outperform the state-of-the-art SA counterparts (e.g., Swin and Focal Transformers) with similar computational costs on the tasks of image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Specifically, FocalNets with tiny and base size achieve 82.3% and 83.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. After pretrained on ImageNet-22K in 224 resolution, it attains 86.5% and 87.3% top-1 accuracy when finetuned with resolution 224 and 384, respectively. When transferred to downstream tasks, FocalNets exhibit clear superiority. For object detection with Mask R-CNN, FocalNet base trained with 1\\times outperforms the Swin counterpart by 2.1 points and already surpasses Swin trained with 3\\times schedule (49.0 v.s. 48.5). For semantic segmentation with UPerNet, FocalNet base at single-scale outperforms Swin by 2.4, and beats Swin at multi-scale (50.5 v.s. 49.7). Using large FocalNet and Mask2former, we achieve 58.5 mIoU for ADE20K semantic segmentation, and 57.9 PQ for COCO Panoptic Segmentation. Using huge FocalNet and DINO, we achieved 64.3 and 64.4 mAP on COCO minival and test-dev, respectively, establishing new SoTA on top of much larger attention-based models like Swinv2-G and BEIT-3.

Kevin Zhou, Zaiyi Liu, Heqin Zhu, Quan Quan, Xueming Fu, Qingsong Yao, Ronghao Xu, Fenghe Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** The generative self-supervised learning strategy exhibits remarkable learning representational capabilities. However, there is limited attention to end-to-end pre-training methods based on a hybrid architecture of CNN and Transformer, which can learn strong local and global representations simultaneously. To address this issue, we propose a generative pre-training strategy called Hybrid Sparse masKing (HySparK) based on masked image modeling and apply it to large-scale pre-training on medical images. First, we perform a bottom-up 3D hybrid masking strategy on the encoder to keep consistency masking. Then we utilize sparse convolution for the top CNNs and encode unmasked patches for the bottom vision Transformers. Second, we employ a simple hierarchical decoder with skip-connections to achieve dense multi-scale feature reconstruction. Third, we implement our pre-training method on a collection of multiple large-scale 3D medical imaging datasets. Extensive experiments indicate that our proposed pre-training strategy demonstrates robust transfer-ability in supervised downstream tasks and sheds light on HySparK's promising prospects.

Multi-Behavior Hypergraph-Enhanced Transformer for Sequential Recommendation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical multi scale attention transformer implementation*\n\n*Chenliang Li, Yanwei Yu, Yuxuan Liang, Lianghao Xia, Chao Huang, Yuhao Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Learning dynamic user preference has become an increasingly important component for many online platforms (e.g., video-sharing sites, e-commerce systems) to make sequential recommendations. Previous works have made many efforts to model item-item transitions over user interaction sequences, based on various architectures, e.g., recurrent neural networks and self-attention mechanism. Recently emerged graph neural networks also serve as useful backbone models to capture item dependencies in sequential recommendation scenarios. Despite their effectiveness, existing methods have far focused on item sequence representation with singular type of interactions, and thus are limited to capture dynamic heterogeneous relational structures between users and items (e.g., page view, add-to-favorite, purchase). To tackle this challenge, we design a Multi-Behavior Hypergraph-enhanced Transformer framework (MBHT) to capture both short-term and long-term cross-type behavior dependencies. Specifically, a multi-scale Transformer is equipped with low-rank self-attention to jointly encode behavior-aware sequential patterns from fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. Additionally, we incorporate the global multi-behavior dependency into the hypergraph neural architecture to capture the hierarchical long-range item correlations in a customized manner. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our MBHT over various state-of-the-art recommendation solutions across different settings. Further ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our model design and benefits of the new MBHT framework. Our implementation code is released at: https://github.com/yuh-yang/MBHT-KDD22.\n\n**Published:** 2022-07-12\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model using hierarchical multi-scale attention mechanisms, here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Hierarchical Attention Architectures in Transformers\n\n- The paper \"SAFormer: An Efficient Hierarchical Transformer Network\" introduces a spatial awareness transformer mechanism along with multi-scale channel-dependent attention. This hierarchical approach adaptively allocates features, which can be beneficial for efficient and effective processing of input data.\n\n- The \"Multi-Scale Temporal Transformer (MSTR)\" for speech emotion recognition also employs a hierarchical structure. It includes a multi-scale temporal feature operator, a fractal self-attention module, and a scale mixer module. This architecture effectively enhances the model's ability to learn multi-scale local representations, which could be adapted for text processing.\n\n## Multi-Scale Processing Implementations\n\n- The MSTR model is a prime example of multi-scale processing. It uses a multi-scale temporal feature operator to produce features at different temporal scales, a fractal self-attention module to model temporal relations within fixed-length windows, and a scale mixer module to fuse these features. This multi-scale approach can be generalized to text data by considering different scales of contextual information.\n\n- The \"LiGAR: LiDAR-Guided Hierarchical Transformer\" framework incorporates a Multi-Scale LIDAR Transformer, which integrates multi-modal data through cross-modal guided attention and an adaptive fusion module. This multi-scale integration strategy could be applied to textual data by considering different scales of contextual information and attention mechanisms.\n\n## Memory Efficiency in Hierarchical Transformers\n\n- The \"SAFormer\" paper highlights the efficiency of hierarchical transformer networks by adaptively allocating features and using multi-scale channel-dependent attention. This approach can significantly reduce computational costs and improve memory efficiency, which is crucial for large-scale language models.\n\n- The MSTR model also reduces computational cost by using fractal self-attention within fixed-length windows, which is more efficient than global self-attention used in vanilla Transformers.\n\n## Performance Analysis of Hierarchical Attention\n\n- The MSTR model demonstrates superior performance over vanilla Transformers and other state-of-the-art methods in speech emotion recognition datasets. This performance improvement is attributed to the multi-scale and hierarchical attention mechanisms, which can be similarly beneficial for text-based tasks.\n\n- The \"SAFormer\" paper likely includes performance analyses showing the benefits of hierarchical and multi-scale attention in terms of accuracy and efficiency, although the specific details are not provided in the summary.\n\n## Integration Strategies for Multi-Scale Processing\n\n- The MSTR model integrates multi-scale features through a scale mixer module, which effectively fuses features at different temporal scales to create a unified emotional feature representation. A similar integration strategy could be applied to text data by fusing contextual information at different scales using appropriate mixing mechanisms.\n\n- The \"LiGAR\" framework uses cross-modal guided attention and an adaptive fusion module to integrate multi-modal data. This approach can be adapted for text data by using cross-attention mechanisms and adaptive fusion strategies to combine features from different scales or contexts.\n\nIn summary, the key insights from these sources suggest that:\n\n- Hierarchical attention architectures, such as those in SAFormer and MSTR, can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of transformers.\n- Multi-scale processing, as seen in MSTR and LiGAR, is crucial for capturing a wide range of contextual information.\n- These approaches can reduce computational costs and improve memory efficiency.\n- Performance analyses indicate that these mechanisms can lead to better accuracy and robustness in various tasks.\n\nBy integrating these concepts into an autoregressive language model, researchers can potentially achieve better performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 2. Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/30 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAs context windows become larger by the day in state-of-the-art models, we expect these gains to become even more relevant. Interpretability. Fig. 8 provides insights into the interpretability aspect of the model's decisionmaking process. It is observed that token removal predominantly occurs when encountering stop words (punctuation), which aligns with the intuition that local information within a sentence becomes less relevant after its completion. Furthermore, it is worth noting that layers at varying depths exhibit distinct behaviors, reinforcing our rationale for dissecting token removal decisions across depth. The variance in sparsity distribution across different depths indicates the necessity of conducting additional interpretability research to obtain valuable insights in the interactions of the tokens within the model. We provide more insights towards this direction in the Appendix C. ## 5 Discussion\n\nWe proposed Adaptively Sparse Attention, a novel approach to dynamically prune the context in decoder-only Transformer architectures. Our results indicate that our technique performs favourably compared to competitive baselines in terms of the ratio between perplexity and sparsity of the attention weights. Remarkably our approach also significantly reduces the computational and memory requirements without affecting its final performance. We practically showcase these benefits achieving more than double the throughput at cases. Adaptively sparse attention comes with two additional practical advantages: first, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained models via a cheap fine-tuning step; second, it represents an orthogonal contribution to the burgeoning research line aimed at increasing the level of efficiency of modern LLMs. As such, we envision its combination with existing techniques like weight pruning and quantization to be a promising avenue for future research. ## References\n\nLalit R Bahl, Frederick Jelinek, and Robert L Mercer.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information.

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: adaptive sparse attention transformer implementation\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

However, their `large' scale introduces significant computational and storage challenges, particularly in managing the key-value states of the transformer, which limits their wider applicability. Therefore, we propose to adaptively release resources from caches and rebuild the necessary key-value states. Particularly, we accomplish this by a lightweight controller module to approximate an ideal top-$K$ sparse attention. This module retains the tokens with the highest top-$K$ attention weights and simultaneously rebuilds the discarded but necessary tokens, which may become essential for future decoding. Comprehensive experiments in natural language generation and modeling reveal that our method is not only competitive with full attention in terms of performance but also achieves a significant throughput improvement of up to 221.8%.

Combiner: Full Attention Transformer with Sparse Computation Cost\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention transformer implementation*\n\n*Hongyu Ren, H. Dai, Zihang Dai, Mengjiao Yang, J. Leskovec, D. Schuurmans, Bo Dai*\n\n**TL;DR:** Combiner is a drop-in replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily implemented in common frameworks, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text modeling tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers provide a class of expressive architectures that are extremely effective for sequence modeling. However, the key limitation of transformers is their quadratic memory and time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ with respect to the sequence length in attention layers, which restricts application in extremely long sequences. Most existing approaches leverage sparsity or low-rank assumptions in the attention matrix to reduce cost, but sacrifice expressiveness. Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attention capability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memory complexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as a conditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate the conditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location can attend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirect attention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations of embeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attention patterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design of such factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost ($\\mathcal{O}(L\\log(L))$ or $\\mathcal{O}(L\\sqrt{L})$). Combiner is a drop-in replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily implemented in common frameworks. An experimental evaluation on both autoregressive and bidirectional sequence tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text modeling tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 4. Fast Attention Over Long Sequences With Dynamic Sparse Flash Attention\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention transformer implementation*\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, F. Fleuret*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention\u2014which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length\u2014becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementation concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attention often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by 2 . 0 \u00d7 and 3 . 3 \u00d7 for sequences of respectively 8 k and 16 k tokens.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Transformers meet Stochastic Block Models: Attention with Data-Adaptive Sparsity and Cost\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention transformer implementation*\n\n*Sungjun Cho, Seonwoo Min, Jinwoo Kim, Moontae Lee, Honglak Lee, Seunghoon Hong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation, and theoretically shows that it outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.\n\n**Abstract:** To overcome the quadratic cost of self-attention, recent works have proposed various sparse attention modules, most of which fall under one of two groups: 1) sparse attention under a hand-crafted patterns and 2) full attention followed by a sparse variant of softmax such as $\\alpha$-entmax. Unfortunately, the first group lacks adaptability to data while the second still requires quadratic cost in training. In this work, we propose SBM-Transformer, a model that resolves both problems by endowing each attention head with a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM). Then, each attention head data-adaptively samples a bipartite graph, the adjacency of which is used as an attention mask for each input. During backpropagation, a straight-through estimator is used to flow gradients beyond the discrete sampling step and adjust the probabilities of sampled edges based on the predictive loss. The forward and backward cost are thus linear to the number of edges, which each attention head can also choose flexibly based on the input. By assessing the distribution of graphs, we theoretically show that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation. Empirical evaluations under the LRA and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.

BiFormer: Vision Transformer with Bi-Level Routing Attention\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention transformer implementation*\n\n*Rynson Lau, Wayne Zhang, Zhanghan Ke, Xinjiang Wang, Lei Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** As the core building block of vision transformers, attention is a powerful tool to capture long-range dependency. However, such power comes at a cost: it incurs a huge computation burden and heavy memory footprint as pairwise token interaction across all spatial locations is computed. A series of works attempt to alleviate this problem by introducing handcrafted and content-agnostic sparsity into attention, such as restricting the attention operation to be inside local windows, axial stripes, or dilated windows. In contrast to these approaches, we propose a novel dynamic sparse attention via bi-level routing to enable a more flexible allocation of computations with content awareness. Specifically, for a query, irrelevant key-value pairs are first filtered out at a coarse region level, and then fine-grained token-to-token attention is applied in the union of remaining candidate regions (\\ie, routed regions). We provide a simple yet effective implementation of the proposed bi-level routing attention, which utilizes the sparsity to save both computation and memory while involving only GPU-friendly dense matrix multiplications. Built with the proposed bi-level routing attention, a new general vision transformer, named BiFormer, is then presented. As BiFormer attends to a small subset of relevant tokens in a \\textbf{query adaptive} manner without distraction from other irrelevant ones, it enjoys both good performance and high computational efficiency, especially in dense prediction tasks. Empirical results across several computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation verify the effectiveness of our design.

Neural Image Compression via Non-Local Attention Optimization and Improved Context Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention transformer implementation*\n\n*Zhan Ma, Yao Wang, Xun Cao, Haojie Liu, Tong Chen, Qiu Shen*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a novel Non-Local Attention optmization and Improved Context modeling-based image compression (NLAIC) algorithm, which is built on top of the deep nerual network (DNN)-based variational auto-encoder (VAE) structure. Our NLAIC 1) embeds non-local network operations as non-linear transforms in the encoders and decoders for both the image and the latent representation probability information (known as hyperprior) to capture both local and global correlations, 2) applies attention mechanism to generate masks that are used to weigh the features, which implicitly adapt bit allocation for feature elements based on their importance, and 3) implements the improved conditional entropy modeling of latent features using joint 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based autoregressive contexts and hyperpriors. Towards the practical application, additional enhancements are also introduced to speed up processing (e.g., parallel 3D CNN-based context prediction), reduce memory consumption (e.g., sparse non-local processing) and alleviate the implementation complexity (e.g., unified model for variable rates without re-training). The proposed model outperforms existing methods on Kodak and CLIC datasets with the state-of-the-art compression efficiency reported, including learned and conventional (e.g., BPG, JPEG2000, JPEG) image compression methods, for both PSNR and MS-SSIM distortion metrics.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design using adaptive sparse attention mechanisms, here are some key findings and insights from the provided sources:\n\n## Implementation Details of Adaptive Sparse Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The paper on the \"Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM)\" introduces a novel probabilistic attention framework that integrates learnable mean and variance into its attention mechanism. This allows the model to dynamically adjust attention based on the input data distribution, which is particularly useful for handling non-stationary data. DAAM uses Gaussian normalization controlled by learnable parameters, enabling each head to focus on different aspects of the data.\n\n## Dynamic Sparsity Patterns in Transformers\n\n- While the sources do not explicitly discuss dynamic sparsity patterns, the concept of adaptive attention mechanisms like DAAM implies a form of dynamic adjustment. However, for explicit dynamic sparsity, the idea of \"Dynamic Context Pruning\" can be relevant, although it is more about pruning uninformative tokens rather than dynamic sparsity in attention weights. This method prunes context tokens during the generation process, which can be seen as a form of dynamic sparsity in the context.\n\n## Efficiency Analysis of Sparse Attention\n\n- The blog post on \"Accelerate Inference of Sparse Transformer Models with OpenVINO\" discusses the efficiency of sparse transformer models. It highlights that sparse models, especially those with high weight sparsity (e.g., 80%), can be optimized for memory-bound deployment scenarios. This optimization involves model pruning and fine-tuning to reduce accuracy degradation, which is crucial for efficient inference.\n\n## Integration Strategies for Adaptive Mechanisms\n\n- The \"PETAH: Parameter Efficient Task Adaptation for Hybrid Transformers\" paper provides insights into integrating adaptive mechanisms with hybrid models. It shows that adapting not only the attention layers but also the convolutional layers in a parameter-efficient way can lead to highly performant and storage-friendly models. This approach can be extended to integrate adaptive sparse attention mechanisms into hybrid transformer architectures.\n\n## Performance Comparisons with Dense Attention\n\n- The \"Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM)\" paper compares the performance of DAAM with traditional self-attention mechanisms. DAAM demonstrates significant improvements, up to approximately +20% in accuracy, especially with highly non-stationary data. This suggests that adaptive sparse attention mechanisms can outperform dense attention in certain scenarios.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Hierarchical Processing**: Combining hierarchical processing with adaptive mechanisms can improve both performance and efficiency. This is evident from the analysis note on VariaHierAT, which suggests that dual-stream processing and distance-dependent attention mechanisms can be effective[Analysis Note].\n- **Memory Efficiency**: Dynamic context pruning and hierarchical structures can significantly reduce memory requirements while maintaining performance. These strategies can be integrated with adaptive sparse attention to enhance memory efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\nBy incorporating these insights, researchers can design autoregressive language models that leverage adaptive sparse attention mechanisms, dynamic sparsity patterns, and efficient integration strategies to achieve better performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

However, their scalability and efficiency remain significant challenges, particularly when handling long sequences and ensuring adaptability to diverse input contexts. The FastTTTLinear Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) in the HierarchicalFastTTTLinear seed design offers a foundational architecture but exhibits limitations in variance reduction, dynamic resource allocation, and hierarchical dependency modeling.\n\nTo address these challenges, this proposal introduces **VariaHierAT**, a novel LM block design that enhances FastTTTLinear by integrating control variates to reduce variance in attention approximations, adaptive sparsity patterns for dynamic computational resource allocation, and hierarchical multi-scale attention mechanisms to capture both local and global dependencies efficiently. These integrations aim to improve the model's efficiency, scalability, and adaptability without compromising performance, paving the way for more robust and versatile language models.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### Control Variates in Transformer Attention\nControl variates have been employed to reduce variance in stochastic estimations, enhancing the stability and efficiency of training processes. Zheng et al. (2023) introduced a framework that integrates control variates into transformer attention mechanisms, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy in long-sequence processing.\n\n### Adaptive Sparsity Patterns\nAdaptive sparsity allows models to dynamically focus computational resources on relevant tokens, improving efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Martins et al. (2019) further explored adaptive sparsity in transformers, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing model interpretability and efficiency.\n\n### Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention\nHierarchical multi-scale attention mechanisms decompose the attention process into multiple hierarchical levels, enabling models to capture dependencies at various granularities efficiently. Wang et al. (2024) proposed hierarchical multi-scale attention in autoregressive models, facilitating the handling of longer sequences without a proportional increase in computational costs. Lee et al.

(2023) demonstrated that integrating control variates with adaptive sparsity patterns within attention mechanisms can optimize computational resources while maintaining model accuracy.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Current Limitations of FastTTTLinear\n1. **Variance in Attention Approximations**:\n   - FastTTTLinear employs linear attention mechanisms that approximate softmax attention. However, the approximation introduces variance, leading to potential instability during training and reduced inference accuracy, especially with long sequences.\n\n2. **Static Resource Allocation**:\n   - The existing FastTTTLinear GAU uses fixed computational resources for attention across all tokens, irrespective of their relevance. This static allocation leads to inefficiencies, as irrelevant tokens consume unnecessary computational power.\n\n3. **Lack of Hierarchical Dependency Modeling**:\n   - FastTTTLinear does not inherently capture multi-scale dependencies, limiting its ability to model both local and global contexts effectively. This deficiency hampers the model's scalability and adaptability to varied input complexities.\n\n### Core Concepts for Improvement\n1. **Control Variates for Variance Reduction**:\n   - Incorporating control variates into the attention mechanism can significantly reduce the variance introduced by attention approximations, enhancing training stability and inference accuracy.\n\n2. **Adaptive Sparsity for Efficient Resource Allocation**:\n   - Implementing adaptive sparsity patterns allows the model to dynamically allocate computational resources, focusing on relevant tokens and thereby improving efficiency and scalability.\n\n3. **Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention for Dependency Modeling**:\n   - Introducing hierarchical multi-scale attention enables the model to capture dependencies at various granularities, facilitating the handling of long sequences without a linear increase in computational costs.\n\n### Mathematical Formulations\n1. **Variance Reduction with Control Variates**:\n   - Let \\( Q, K, V \\) represent the query, key, and value matrices, respectively. In FastTTTLinear, attention is approximated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) \\approx Q K^T V\n     \\]\n   - Introducing control variates \\( C \\) modifies the approximation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) \\approx Q K^T V + C\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( C \\) is designed to offset the variance introduced by the approximation, enhancing stability.\n\n2. **Adaptive Sparsity Pattern Selection**:\n   - Define a sparsity mask \\( M \\) that is a function of the input context \\( X \\):\n     \\[\n     M = f_{\\text{mask}}(X)\n     \\]\n   - The attention computation becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = Q (M \\odot K)^T V\n     \\]\n   - \\( f_{\\text{mask}} \\) dynamically determines which tokens to focus on, enabling sparsity.\n\n3. **Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention**:\n   - Partition the input sequence into hierarchical levels with varying granularities. For example, a two-level hierarchy with local and global attention:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Attention}_{\\text{hier}}(Q, K, V) = \\text{Attention}_{\\text{local}}(Q_l, K_l, V_l) + \\text{Attention}_{\\text{global}}(Q_g, K_g, V_g)\n     \\]\n   - Local attention captures fine-grained dependencies, while global attention models long-range dependencies.\n\n### Potential Trade-offs\n1. **Increased Architectural Complexity**:\n   - Integrating control variates, adaptive sparsity, and hierarchical attention introduces additional components, potentially increasing the model's architectural complexity.\n\n2. **Computational Overhead**:\n   - While adaptive sparsity and hierarchical attention aim to optimize computations, the dynamic selection processes and multi-level computations may introduce overheads that need careful optimization.\n\n3. **Training Stability**:\n   - Introducing control variates and adaptive mechanisms necessitates meticulous tuning to maintain training stability and prevent overfitting or underfitting.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection\nFastTTTLinear\n```\n\n### Modification Overview\n\nTo overcome the identified limitations of FastTTTLinear, the following modifications are proposed:\n\n1. **Integration of Control Variates**:\n   - Incorporate control variates into the attention mechanism to reduce variance in attention approximations, enhancing training stability and inference accuracy.\n\n2. **Implementation of Adaptive Sparsity Patterns**:\n   - Introduce adaptive sparsity in the attention computation to dynamically allocate computational resources based on token relevance, improving efficiency and scalability.\n\n3. **Embedding Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention**:\n   - Develop a hierarchical multi-scale attention mechanism within FastTTTLinear to capture dependencies at multiple granularities, enabling the model to handle long sequences effectively.\n\n### Detailed Modifications\n\n#### 1.

Implementation of Adaptive Sparsity Patterns\n\n**Objective**: Dynamically focus computational resources on relevant tokens, reducing unnecessary computations.\n\n**Implementation**:\n- Introduce a sparsity mask \\( M \\) that is a function of the input context:\n  \\[\n  M = \\sigma(W_s X + b_s)\n  \\]\n  where \\( W_s \\) and \\( b_s \\) are learnable parameters, and \\( \\sigma \\) is a sigmoid activation function.\n- Apply the mask to the key matrix:\n  \\[\n  K_{\\text{masked}} = M \\odot K\n  \\]\n- Modify the attention computation:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = Q K_{\\text{masked}}^T V + C\n  \\]\n  \n**Mathematical Formulation**:\n- Define the sparsity mask generation function \\( f_{\\text{mask}} \\):\n  \\[\n  f_{\\text{mask}}(X) = \\sigma(W_s X + b_s)\n  \\]\n  where higher values in \\( M \\) indicate higher relevance of the corresponding token.\n\n#### 3.
