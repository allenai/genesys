Transformers rely on a trainable attention mechanism that identifies complex dependencies between the elements of each input sequence. Unfortunately, the regular Transformer scales quadratically with the number of tokens $L$ in the input sequence, which is prohibitively expensive for large $L$ and precludes its usage in settings with limited computational resources even for moderate values of $L$. Several solutions have been proposed to address this issue (Beltagy et al., 2020, Gulati et al., 2020, Chan et al. 2020, Child et al. 2019, Bello et al., 2019). Most approaches restrict the attention mechanism to attend to local neighborhoods (Parmar et al. 2018) or incorporate structural priors on attention such as sparsity (Child et al., 2019), pooling-based compression (Rae et al, 2020) clustering/binning/convolution techniques (e.g. (Roy et al., 2020) which applies $k$-means clustering to learn dynamic sparse attention regions, or (Kitaev et al. 2020), where locality sensitive hashing is used to group together tokens of similar embeddings), sliding windows (Beltagy et al., 2020), or truncated targeting (Chelba et al. 2020). There is also a long line of research on using dense attention matrices, but defined by low-rank kernels substituting softmax (Katharopoulos et al. 2020. Shen et al., 2018). Those methods critically rely on kernels admitting explicit representations as dot-products of finite positive-feature vectors. The approaches above do not aim to approximate regular attention, but rather propose simpler and more tractable attention mechanisms, often by incorporating additional constraints (e.g. identical query and key sets as in (Kitaev et al. 2020) , or by trading regular with sparse attention using more\n\n[^0]layers (Child et al., 2019). Unfortunately, there is a lack of rigorous guarantees for the representation power produced by such methods, and sometimes the validity of sparsity patterns can only be verified empirically through trial and error by constructing special GPU operations (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2. DiJiang: Efficient Large Language Models through Compact Kernelization (Avg.

However, the improvement strategies for attention mechanisms typically necessitate extensive retraining, which is impractical for large language models with a vast array of parameters. In this paper, we present DiJiang, a novel Frequency Domain Kernelization approach that enables the transformation of a pre-trained vanilla Transformer into a linear complexity model with little training costs. By employing a weighted Quasi-Monte Carlo method for sampling, the proposed approach theoretically offers superior approximation efficiency. To further reduce the training computational complexity, our kernelization is based on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to the original Transformer, but with significantly reduced training costs and much faster inference speeds. Our DiJiang-7B achieves comparable performance with LLaMA2-7B on various benchmark while requires only about 1/50 training cost.

According to Bochner's theorem, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the kernel function $K(x, z)$ and the probability density $p(w)$ defined on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Monte Carlo is equal weight approximation to kernel integrals. Taking $\\varphi_{p}(x):=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}}\\left[e^{-i w_{1}^{\\top} x}, \\ldots, e^{-i w_{m}^{\\top} x}\\right]^{\\top}$, the feature maps can be constructed as:\n\n$$\nK(x, z)=E_{w \\sim p(\\cdot)}\\left[e^{i w^{\\top} x}\\left(e^{i w^{\\top} z}\\right)^{*}\\right] \\approx \\varphi_{p}(x)^{\\top} \\varphi_{p}^{*}(z)\n$$\n\nwhere $w_{i} \\sim p(\\cdot)$ are samples constructed by Monte Carlo methods. $\\varphi_{p}(\\cdot)$ is the explicit finite dimensional feature map, which depends on the kernel $K$. Moving forward, instead of employing the Monte Carlo method as suggested in (Choromanski et al., 2020), we utilize the Quasi-Monte Carlo method (Le et al., 2013). This shift enables the estimation of the integral using a specific uniform distribution as opposed to a randomly sampled distribution. Utilizing Bochner's theorem allows for a transformative interpretation of the attention mechanism in Transformer models. For the Gaussian Kernel:\n\n$$\nK_{G}(x, y):=e^{-\\frac{\\|x-y\\|^{2}}{2}}=e^{-\\frac{\\|x\\|^{2}+\\|y\\|^{2}}{2}} e^{x^{\\top} y}\n$$\n\nsince the $x$ and $y$ in attention mechanism is usually normalized, the Gaussian Kernel can be regarded as $e^{x^{\\top} y}$, which is the same as the calculation between the queries and keys. Theorem 3.2. The Positive Fixed Features (PFF) is formulated as:\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{P F F}(x):=\\frac{e^{-\\|x\\|^{2}}}{\\sqrt{m}}\\left[e^{\\Phi^{-1}\\left(t_{1}\\right) x^{\\top} v_{1}}, \\ldots, e^{\\Phi^{-1}\\left(t_{m}\\right) x^{\\top} v_{m}}\\right]^{\\top}\n$$\n\nwhere $V=\\left[v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{m}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{S}^{d \\times m}$ is asymptotically uniformly distributed and $t_{i} \\sim U(0,1)$. Then, $\\varphi_{P F F}(x)^{\\top} \\varphi_{P F F}(z)$ is an unbiased estimate of Gaussian kernel $K_{G}(x, y)$. The proof of this theorem involves a transformation to spherical coordinates, which can be found in the supplementary material. Through this transformation, we demonstrate that an approximation based on any asymptotically uniformly distribution can closely approximate the original Gaussian kernel. Furthermore, according to (Asmussen \\& Glynn, 2007), when utilizing uniform sequences, the Quasi-Monte Carlo method can offer superior approximation efficiency compared to the traditional Monte Carlo method. The approximation efficiency of Quasi-Monte Carlo is $\\mathcal{O}(1 / m)$, which is more favorable than the $\\mathcal{O}\\left(1 / m^{-0.5}\\right)$ efficiency of Monte Carlo. Consequently, this implies that using the PFF 9 kernel for approximating the Gaussian kernel is more advantageous than the PRF kernel in Equation 5. Theorem 3.3. The Weighted Positive Fixed Features (WPFF) is formulated as:\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{W P F F}(x):=\\frac{D e^{-\\|x\\|^{2}}}{\\sqrt{m}}\\left[e^{\\Phi^{-1}\\left(t_{1}\\right) x^{\\top} v_{1}}, \\ldots, e^{\\Phi^{-1}\\left(t_{m}\\right) x^{\\top} v_{m}}\\right]^{\\top}\n$$\n\nwhere $D$ is a learnable parameter which can be optimized by the input $x$. Then the upper bound of the integral estimation error of the objective function by WPFF (Weighted Positive Fixed Features) method is not greater than the upper bound of the integral estimation error of the objective function by PFF (Positive Fixed Features) method. Building upon the Quasi-Monte Carlo foundation, we further introduce the concept of weighted Quasi-Monte Carlo to enhance the efficiency of approximation. This advancement aims to leverage the strengths of the Quasi-Monte Carlo method, augmenting it with strategically weighted sampling to improve the precision and convergence rates of our approximations. The detailed proof is provided in the supplementary materials. To further accelerate the training speed, we propose the use of frequency domain transformations to reduce the required computational resources. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) are commonly used methods for such transformations. Compared to ordinary orthogonal transformations, frequency domain transformations have algorithms for rapid computation, significantly reducing the computational cost of our proposed mapping. Specifically, the complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\mathrm{m})$ can be reduced to $\\mathcal{O}(\\log (m))$.

Note that since the $x$ in attention mechanism is usually normalized, we ignore the term of $\\|x\\|^{2}$ in Equation 9 for efficiency. Therefore, using DCT as a kernel can closely approximate the original attention mechanism while have low computation complexity. For scenarios where $m>d$, more DCT transformations can be derived using different boundary conditions.\n```\n\n#### 3. \u221e-former: Infinite Memory Transformer (Avg.

One issue of the vanilla transformer model lies in\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1e87ac89fa2bec7d4d6fg-01.jpg?height=441&width=780&top_left_y=750&top_left_x=1049)\n\nFigure 1: TransNORMER has smaller memory footprints (circle sizes) and produces clearly favorable speed ( $x$-axis) and overall scores ( $y$-axis), when evaluated on the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark than the vanilla transformer and other competing methods. its quadratic space-time complexity with respect to the input length. Various prior works attempt to alleviate this inefficiency (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a; Kitaev et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022b). In this work, we focus on a particular subset of these methods, known as kernel-based linear transformers (Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022) considering their desirable linear space-time complexity. Despite their space-time efficiency, linear transformers are not always in favor for practical adoption, largely due to the degraded performance than the vanilla model. To address this issue, we take a close look at existing kernel-based linear transformers and identify $\\boldsymbol{t w o}$ deficiencies that lead to such a performance gap. Unbounded gradients. Most existing linear transformers inherit attention formulation from the vanilla transformer, which scales attention scores to ensure they are bounded within $[0,1]$. However, we theoretically show that such a scaling strategy\nrenders unbounded gradients for linear transformer models. As a result, the unbounded gradients empirically lead to unstable convergence as our preliminary experiments suggest. Attention dilution. Previous works (Titsias, 2016; Jang et al., 2016; Gao and Pavel, 2017; Qin et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022b,a) suggest that in vanilla transformer, softmax attention maps tend to be local. In contrast, as shown in Fig 2, we observe that linear transformers often trivially distribute attention scores over the entire sequence even in early layers. Due to this issue, which we refer as attention dilution, important local information is less well preserved in linear models, resulting in inferior performance. This negative impact of attention dilution is also evidenced by the performance drop in our controlled experiments if partly replacing vanilla attention in transformer layers with linear attention ones. To mitigate these issues, we propose a linear transformer model, called TrANSNORMER, which shows better performance than vanilla transformer on a wide range of task while being significantly faster during runtime, as shown in Fig. 1. To avoid the unbounded gradients, we introduce NORMATTENTION, which gets rid of scaling over attention matrices while appending an additional normalization only after the attention layer. The choice of the normalization operator is unrestricted, for example, LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) or RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019) both serve the purpose. We show empirical results demonstrating that with Normattention, the gradients are more stable during training, which in turn leads to more consistent convergence. To alleviate the attention dilution issue, we modify the vanilla attention and allow each token to only attend to its neighbouring tokens, resulting in a diagonal attention. To mimic the behaviors on local semantics of the vanilla transformer, we employ the diagonal attention on early layers while using NormAttention for later ones. In this way, we encourage the model to capture both local and global language context. Note that our diagonal attention can be efficiently computed such that the overall linear space-time complexity of TRANSNORMER is preserved. We perform extensive experiments on standard tasks, where TransNORmER demonstrates lower language modeling perplexities on WikiText-103 and overall higher text classification accuracy on\nGLUE than vanilla model and other competing methods. In addition, on the challenging LongRange Arena benchmark, TransNormer also shows favorable results while being faster and more scalable with longer inputs during both training and inference time. ## 2 Background and related work\n\nWe first briefly review vanilla transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) and its efficient variants. The key component of transformers is the self-attention, which operates on query $\\mathbf{Q}$, key $\\mathbf{K}$ and value $\\mathbf{V}$ matrices; each of them is the image of a linear projection taking $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ as input:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{Q}, \\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{K}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}\n$$\n\nwith $n$ the input length, $d$ the hidden dimension. The output $\\mathbf{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ is formulated as:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}} / \\sqrt{d}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\n$$\n\nwhere the $\\operatorname{Softmax}(\\cdot)$ step renders quadratic spacetime complexity with respect to the input length, making it prohibitive for vanilla transformer to scale to long input sequences. To address this issue, numerous efficient transformers have been explored in the literature. These methods can be generally categorized into two families, i.e., pattern based methods and kernel based methods. Pattern based methods (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a; Kitaev et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019) sparsify the attention calculation with handcrafted or learnable masking patterns. Kernel-based methods adopt kernel functions to decompose softmax attention, which reduces the theoretical space-time complexity to linear. In this paper, we refer the kernel-based variants as linear transformers for simplicity. In the kernel-based methods (Choromanski et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020), a kernel function $\\phi(\\cdot)$ maps queries and keys to their hidden representations. Then the output of the linear attention can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{O} & =\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}^{-1} \\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right] \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\Delta} & =\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}_{n}\\right]\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the product of keys and values are computed to avoid the quadratic $n \\times n$ matrix.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 15 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: kernel-based attention, memory-efficient transformers, gaussian kernel neural networks\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Fine-grained Fact Verification with Kernel Graph Attention Network\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based attention*\n\n*Zhenghao Liu, Chenyan Xiong, Maosong Sun, Zhiyuan Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents Kernel Graph Attention Network (KGAT), which conducts more fine-grained fact verification with kernel-based attentions and significantly outperforms existing fact verification models on FEVER, a large-scale benchmark for fact verification.\n\n**Abstract:** Fact Verification requires fine-grained natural language inference capability that finds subtle clues to identify the syntactical and semantically correct but not well-supported claims. This paper presents Kernel Graph Attention Network (KGAT), which conducts more fine-grained fact verification with kernel-based attentions. Given a claim and a set of potential evidence sentences that form an evidence graph, KGAT introduces node kernels, which better measure the importance of the evidence node, and edge kernels, which conduct fine-grained evidence propagation in the graph, into Graph Attention Networks for more accurate fact verification. KGAT achieves a 70.38% FEVER score and significantly outperforms existing fact verification models on FEVER, a large-scale benchmark for fact verification. Our analyses illustrate that, compared to dot-product attentions, the kernel-based attention concentrates more on relevant evidence sentences and meaningful clues in the evidence graph, which is the main source of KGAT\u2019s effectiveness.

Transformer Dissection: An Unified Understanding for Transformer\u2019s Attention via the Lens of Kernel\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based attention*\n\n*Yao-Hung Hubert Tsai, Shaojie Bai, M. Yamada, Louis-Philippe Morency, R. Salakhutdinov*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new formulation of attention via the lens of the kernel is presented, which models the input as a product of symmetric kernels and achieves competitive performance to the current state of the art model with less computation.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer is a powerful architecture that achieves superior performance on various sequence learning tasks, including neural machine translation, language understanding, and sequence prediction. At the core of the Transformer is the attention mechanism, which concurrently processes all inputs in the streams. In this paper, we present a new formulation of attention via the lens of the kernel. To be more precise, we realize that the attention can be seen as applying kernel smoother over the inputs with the kernel scores being the similarities between inputs. This new formulation gives us a better way to understand individual components of the Transformer\u2019s attention, such as the better way to integrate the positional embedding. Another important advantage of our kernel-based formulation is that it paves the way to a larger space of composing Transformer\u2019s attention. As an example, we propose a new variant of Transformer\u2019s attention which models the input as a product of symmetric kernels. This approach achieves competitive performance to the current state of the art model with less computation. In our experiments, we empirically study different kernel construction strategies on two widely used tasks: neural machine translation and sequence prediction.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 213  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 3. Self-Attention through Kernel-Eigen Pair Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based attention*\n\n*Yingyi Chen, Qinghua Tao, F. Tonin, J. Suykens*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Kernel-Eigen Pair Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes (KEP-SVGP) for building uncertainty-aware self-attention where the asymmetry of attention kernels is tackled by Kernel SVD (KSVD) and a reduced complexity is acquired.\n\n**Abstract:** While the great capability of Transformers significantly boosts prediction accuracy, it could also yield overconfident predictions and require calibrated uncertainty estimation, which can be commonly tackled by Gaussian processes (GPs). Existing works apply GPs with symmetric kernels under variational inference to the attention kernel; however, omitting the fact that attention kernels are in essence asymmetric. Moreover, the complexity of deriving the GP posteriors remains high for large-scale data. In this work, we propose Kernel-Eigen Pair Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes (KEP-SVGP) for building uncertainty-aware self-attention where the asymmetry of attention kernels is tackled by Kernel SVD (KSVD) and a reduced complexity is acquired. Through KEP-SVGP, i) the SVGP pair induced by the two sets of singular vectors from KSVD w.r.t. the attention kernel fully characterizes the asymmetry; ii) using only a small set of adjoint eigenfunctions from KSVD, the derivation of SVGP posteriors can be based on the inversion of a diagonal matrix containing singular values, contributing to a reduction in time complexity; iii) an evidence lower bound is derived so that variational parameters and network weights can be optimized with it.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient transformers*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1366  (*Influential: 136*)\n\n#### 5. Memory Efficient Continual Learning with Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient transformers*\n\n*B. Ermi\u015f, Giovanni Zappella, Martin Wistuba, Aditya Rawal, C. Archambeau*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper devise a method to incrementally train a model on a sequence of tasks using pre-trained Transformers and extending them with Adapters that is able to scale to a large number of tasks without significant overhead and allows sharing information across tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** In many real-world scenarios, data to train machine learning models becomes available over time. Unfortunately, these models struggle to continually learn new concepts without forgetting what has been learnt in the past. This phenomenon is known as catastrophic forgetting and it is difficult to prevent due to practical constraints. For instance, the amount of data that can be stored or the computational resources that can be used might be limited. Moreover, applications increasingly rely on large pre-trained neural networks, such as pre-trained Transformers, since the resources or data might not be available in sufficiently large quantities to practitioners to train the model from scratch. In this paper, we devise a method to incrementally train a model on a sequence of tasks using pre-trained Transformers and extending them with Adapters. Different than the existing approaches, our method is able to scale to a large number of tasks without significant overhead and allows sharing information across tasks. On both image and text classification tasks, we empirically demonstrate that our method maintains a good predictive performance without retraining the model or increasing the number of model parameters over time. The resulting model is also significantly faster at inference time compared to Adapter-based state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient Attention Manipulation\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient transformers*\n\n*Mayukh Deb, Bjorn Deiseroth, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, P. Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. Neural Tangent Kernel: Convergence and Generalization in Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: gaussian kernel neural networks*\n\n*Arthur Jacot, Franck Gabriel, Cl\u00e9ment Hongler*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that the evolution of an ANN during training can also be described by a kernel: during gradient descent on the parameters of anANN, the network function follows the so-called kernel gradient associated with a new object, which is called the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK).\n\n**Abstract:** At initialization, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are equivalent to Gaussian processes in the infinite-width limit, thus connecting them to kernel methods. We prove that the evolution of an ANN during training can also be described by a kernel: during gradient descent on the parameters of an ANN, the network function (which maps input vectors to output vectors) follows the so-called kernel gradient associated with a new object, which we call the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This kernel is central to describe the generalization features of ANNs. While the NTK is random at initialization and varies during training, in the infinite-width limit it converges to an explicit limiting kernel and stays constant during training. This makes it possible to study the training of ANNs in function space instead of parameter space. Convergence of the training can then be related to the positive-definiteness of the limiting NTK. We then focus on the setting of least-squares regression and show that in the infinite-width limit, the network function follows a linear differential equation during training. The convergence is fastest along the largest kernel principal components of the input data with respect to the NTK, hence suggesting a theoretical motivation for early stopping. Finally we study the NTK numerically, observe its behavior for wide networks, and compare it to the infinite-width limit.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 2792  (*Influential: 568*)\n\n#### 8. Classifying high-dimensional Gaussian mixtures: Where kernel methods fail and neural networks succeed\n\n*From Search Query: gaussian kernel neural networks*\n\n*Maria Refinetti, Sebastian Goldt, Florent Krzakala, Lenka Zdeborov'a*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is theoretically shown that two-layer neural networks (2LNN) with only a few hidden neurons can beat the performance of kernel learning on a simple Gaussian mixture classification task and illustrates how over-parametrising the neural network leads to faster convergence, but does not improve its final performance.\n\n**Abstract:** A recent series of theoretical works showed that the dynamics of neural networks with a certain initialisation are well-captured by kernel methods. Concurrent empirical work demonstrated that kernel methods can come close to the performance of neural networks on some image classification tasks. These results raise the question of whether neural networks only learn successfully if kernels also learn successfully, despite neural networks being more expressive. Here, we show theoretically that two-layer neural networks (2LNN) with only a few hidden neurons can beat the performance of kernel learning on a simple Gaussian mixture classification task. We study the high-dimensional limit where the number of samples is linearly proportional to the input dimension, and show that while small 2LNN achieve near-optimal performance on this task, lazy training approaches such as random features and kernel methods do not. Our analysis is based on the derivation of a closed set of equations that track the learning dynamics of the 2LNN and thus allow to extract the asymptotic performance of the network as a function of signal-to-noise ratio and other hyperparameters. We finally illustrate how over-parametrising the neural network leads to faster convergence, but does not improve its final performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 66  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 9.

Pehlevan*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new spectral principle is identified: as the size of the training set grows, kernel machines and neural networks fit successively higher spectral modes of the target function.\n\n**Abstract:** We derive analytical expressions for the generalization performance of kernel regression as a function of the number of training samples using theoretical methods from Gaussian processes and statistical physics. Our expressions apply to wide neural networks due to an equivalence between training them and kernel regression with the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). By computing the decomposition of the total generalization error due to different spectral components of the kernel, we identify a new spectral principle: as the size of the training set grows, kernel machines and neural networks fit successively higher spectral modes of the target function. When data are sampled from a uniform distribution on a high-dimensional hypersphere, dot product kernels, including NTK, exhibit learning stages where different frequency modes of the target function are learned.

Attention-Based Adaptive Spectral-Spatial Kernel ResNet for Hyperspectral Image Classification\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based attention*\n\n*Lorenzo Bruzzone, Tiecheng Song, Suvojit Manna, Swalpa Kumar Roy*\n\n**Abstract:** Hyperspectral images (HSIs) provide rich spectral-spatial information with stacked hundreds of contiguous narrowbands. Due to the existence of noise and band correlation, the selection of informative spectral-spatial kernel features poses a challenge. This is often addressed by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with receptive field (RF) having fixed sizes. However, these solutions cannot enable neurons to effectively adjust RF sizes and cross-channel dependencies when forward and backward propagations are used to optimize the network. In this article, we present an attention-based adaptive spectral-spatial kernel improved residual network (A\u00b2S\u00b2K-ResNet) with spectral attention to capture discriminative spectral-spatial features for HSI classification in an end-to-end training fashion. In particular, the proposed network learns selective 3-D convolutional kernels to jointly extract spectral-spatial features using improved 3-D ResBlocks and adopts an efficient feature recalibration (EFR) mechanism to boost the classification performance. Extensive experiments are performed on three well-known hyperspectral data sets, i.e., IP, KSC, and UP, and the proposed A\u00b2S\u00b2K-ResNet can provide better classification results in terms of overall accuracy (OA), average accuracy (AA), and Kappa compared with the existing methods investigated.

Attention-Based Clustering: Learning a Kernel from Context\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based attention*\n\n*Chithrupa Ramesh, Erik Visse-Martindale, Samuel Coward*\n\n**Abstract:** In machine learning, no data point stands alone. We believe that context is an underappreciated concept in many machine learning methods. We propose Attention-Based Clustering (ABC), a neural architecture based on the attention mechanism, which is designed to learn latent representations that adapt to context within an input set, and which is inherently agnostic to input sizes and number of clusters. By learning a similarity kernel, our method directly combines with any out-of-the-box kernel-based clustering approach. We present competitive results for clustering Omniglot characters and include analytical evidence of the effectiveness of an attention-based approach for clustering.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-02\n\n\n\n#### 3. EfficientViT: Memory Efficient Vision Transformer with Cascaded Group Attention\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient transformers*\n\n*Yixuan Yuan, Han Hu, Yuqing Yang, Ningxin Zheng, Houwen Peng, Xinyu Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers have shown great success due to their high model capabilities. However, their remarkable performance is accompanied by heavy computation costs, which makes them unsuitable for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a family of high-speed vision transformers named EfficientViT. We find that the speed of existing transformer models is commonly bounded by memory inefficient operations, especially the tensor reshaping and element-wise functions in MHSA. Therefore, we design a new building block with a sandwich layout, i.e., using a single memory-bound MHSA between efficient FFN layers, which improves memory efficiency while enhancing channel communication. Moreover, we discover that the attention maps share high similarities across heads, leading to computational redundancy. To address this, we present a cascaded group attention module feeding attention heads with different splits of the full feature, which not only saves computation cost but also improves attention diversity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate EfficientViT outperforms existing efficient models, striking a good trade-off between speed and accuracy. For instance, our EfficientViT-M5 surpasses MobileNetV3-Large by 1.9% in accuracy, while getting 40.4% and 45.2% higher throughput on Nvidia V100 GPU and Intel Xeon CPU, respectively. Compared to the recent efficient model MobileViT-XXS, EfficientViT-M2 achieves 1.8% superior accuracy, while running 5.8x/3.7x faster on the GPU/CPU, and 7.4x faster when converted to ONNX format.

H3T: Efficient Integration of Memory Optimization and Parallelism for Large-scale Transformer Training\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient transformers*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, big models based on Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many artificial intelligence (AI) tasks.\nDespite the success of these Transformer-based models, their huge parameter size poses a serious challenge to their training, both from the storage and computation perspectives.\nTo this end, memory optimization (e.g., rematerialization and offloading) and parallelism (e.g., data parallelism and model parallelism) are widely explored to make training Transformers more efficient.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework to automatically find an efficient integration of memory optimization and parallelism for High-Throughput Transformer Training (named H3T), which is rarely considered by existing efforts for training big Transformer-based models.\nSpecifically, we design search algorithms to combine appropriate memory optimization strategies and parallelism schemes to achieve a balance between memory overhead and training efficiency.\nWe implement H3T based on an open-source toolkit BMTrain and then use H3T to train the Transformers of different sizes to evaluate the efficiency of H3T.\nThe experimental results show that H3T outperforms the most popular deep learning (DL) toolkit Megatron-DeepSpeed by $1.2\\times \\sim 4.3\\times$ training speed while reducing $34.6\\% \\sim 80.5\\%$ of memory overhead.\nMoreover, H3T can use only 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs to train GPT-3-175B, which is very difficult for existing DL toolkits.

Deep Neural Networks as Gaussian Processes\n\n*From Search Query: gaussian kernel neural networks*\n\n*Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Samuel S.

This correspondence enables exact\nBayesian inference for infinite width neural networks on regression tasks by\nmeans of evaluating the corresponding GP.

This mechanism allows the model to learn a probability distribution over the input elements, enabling more nuanced and uncertain relationships between inputs and outputs. This approach can mitigate issues like rank-collapse and gradient vanishing, which are common in conventional attention mechanisms.\n\n### Kernelized Attention\nThe concept of kernelized attention is explored in the context of graph learning. Here, the self-attention mechanism is reformulated using kernel methods, where a non-negative kernel function is used to compute attention scores. This can be represented with a corresponding feature map, simplifying the computation and reducing complexity. For example, the use of the RBF kernel or Positive Random Features can be effective in this context.\n\n### Gaussian Kernel Attention\nThe SOFT paper mentioned in the analysis uses a Gaussian kernel function to replace the dot-product similarity in self-attention, eliminating the need for softmax normalization. This approach enables the approximation of the full self-attention matrix via a low-rank matrix decomposition, which is more efficient and maintains expressiveness.\n\n## Memory Access Optimization Techniques for Large Language Models\n\n### Hierarchical Memory Management\nTo optimize memory access, hierarchical approaches to memory management can be beneficial. For instance, the Node-to-Cluster Attention mechanism in graph transformers processes information at both node and cluster levels, avoiding the need to compress each cluster into a single embedding. This approach preserves node-level details and reduces the computational complexity associated with traditional graph coarsening methods.\n\n### Efficient Attention Mechanisms\nThe use of probabilistic attention mechanisms, as in the generalized probabilistic attention mechanism, can help in reducing the memory complexity. Additionally, softmax-free approaches like those using Gaussian kernels can simplify the computation and reduce the memory footprint by avoiding the need for softmax normalization.\n\n### Layer Normalization and Residual Connections\nImplementing layer normalization and residual connections, as commonly done in transformer architectures, can help stabilize training and enable the use of deeper models without significant memory overhead. This is highlighted in the improvements made to Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) by incorporating lessons from transformers.\n\n## Applications of Gaussian Kernels in Neural Network Architectures\n\n### Gaussian Kernel in Self-Attention\nGaussian kernels can replace the traditional dot-product similarity in self-attention mechanisms. This approach avoids the softmax normalization step, allowing for a more efficient computation of attention scores. The SOFT paper demonstrates that this method can maintain the expressiveness of the model while reducing computational complexity.\n\n### Sparse Gaussian Process Attention\nIn the context of safety-critical domains, Sparse Gaussian Process attention (SGPA) is proposed. This method performs Bayesian inference directly in the output space of multi-head attention blocks using sparse Gaussian processes. It replaces the scaled dot-product operation with a valid symmetric kernel, improving in-distribution calibration and out-of-distribution robustness.\n\n### Kernelized Softmax\nThe kernelized softmax approach involves expressing the self-attention mechanism using a non-negative kernel function. This can be represented with a feature map, simplifying the computation and reducing complexity. Various choices of feature maps, such as the RBF kernel, can be effective in this context.\n\nBy integrating these kernel-based attention mechanisms, optimizing memory access patterns through hierarchical and efficient attention mechanisms, and leveraging Gaussian kernels for improved efficiency and expressiveness, researchers can significantly enhance the performance and scalability of autoregressive language models.\n",

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 2.

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods.

Transformers rely on a trainable attention mechanism that identifies complex dependencies between the elements of each input sequence. Unfortunately, the regular Transformer scales quadratically with the number of tokens $L$ in the input sequence, which is prohibitively expensive for large $L$ and precludes its usage in settings with limited computational resources even for moderate values of $L$. Several solutions have been proposed to address this issue (Beltagy et al., 2020, Gulati et al., 2020, Chan et al. 2020, Child et al. 2019, Bello et al., 2019). Most approaches restrict the attention mechanism to attend to local neighborhoods (Parmar et al. 2018) or incorporate structural priors on attention such as sparsity (Child et al., 2019), pooling-based compression (Rae et al, 2020) clustering/binning/convolution techniques (e.g. (Roy et al., 2020) which applies $k$-means clustering to learn dynamic sparse attention regions, or (Kitaev et al. 2020), where locality sensitive hashing is used to group together tokens of similar embeddings), sliding windows (Beltagy et al., 2020), or truncated targeting (Chelba et al. 2020). There is also a long line of research on using dense attention matrices, but defined by low-rank kernels substituting softmax (Katharopoulos et al. 2020. Shen et al., 2018). Those methods critically rely on kernels admitting explicit representations as dot-products of finite positive-feature vectors. The approaches above do not aim to approximate regular attention, but rather propose simpler and more tractable attention mechanisms, often by incorporating additional constraints (e.g. identical query and key sets as in (Kitaev et al. 2020) , or by trading regular with sparse attention using more\n\n[^0]layers (Child et al., 2019). Unfortunately, there is a lack of rigorous guarantees for the representation power produced by such methods, and sometimes the validity of sparsity patterns can only be verified empirically through trial and error by constructing special GPU operations (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 3. KERPLE: Kernelized Relative Positional Embedding for Length Extrapolation (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*Ta-Chung Chi, Ting-Han Fan, P. Ramadge, Alexander I. Rudnicky*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 39  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n**TL;DR:** KERPLE is proposed, a framework that generalizes relative position embedding for extrapolation by kernelizing positional differences using conditionally positive definite (CPD) kernels, and it is shown that a CPD kernel can be transformed into a PD kernel by adding a constant offset.\n\n**Abstract:** Relative positional embeddings (RPE) have received considerable attention since RPEs effectively model the relative distance among tokens and enable length extrapolation. We propose KERPLE, a framework that generalizes relative position embedding for extrapolation by kernelizing positional differences. We achieve this goal using conditionally positive definite (CPD) kernels, a class of functions known for generalizing distance metrics. To maintain the inner product interpretation of self-attention, we show that a CPD kernel can be transformed into a PD kernel by adding a constant offset. This offset is implicitly absorbed in the Softmax normalization during self-attention. The diversity of CPD kernels allows us to derive various RPEs that enable length extrapolation in a principled way. Experiments demonstrate that the logarithmic variant achieves excellent extrapolation performance on three large language modeling datasets. Our implementation and pretrained checkpoints are released at~\\url{https://github.com/chijames/KERPLE.git}.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/37 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nIn Biocomputing 2002, pages 564-575.

However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/52 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\nIn Thirty-Fifth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, 2021.

Prior research has introduced absolute positional encoding (APE) and relative positional encoding (RPE) to distinguish token positions in given sequences. However, both APE and RPE remain fixed after model training regardless of input data, limiting their adaptability and flexibility. Hence, we expect that the desired positional encoding should be context-adaptive and can be dynamically adjusted with the given attention. In this paper, we propose a Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE) method, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and learned fixed priors. Experimental validation on real-world datasets (Arxiv, Books3, and CHE) demonstrates that CAPE enhances model performances in terms of trained length and length generalization, where the improvements are statistically significant. The model visualization suggests that our model can keep both local and anti-local information. Finally, we successfully train the model on sequence length 128 and achieve better performance at evaluation sequence length 8192, compared with other static positional encoding methods, revealing the benefit of the adaptive positional encoding method.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/29 (Score: 0.70)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 6327-6335.

Primal-Attention: Self-attention through Asymmetric Kernel SVD in Primal Representation\n\n*From Search Query: kernel attention implementation*\n\n*Yingyi Chen, Qinghua Tao, F. Tonin, J. Suykens*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work provides a primal-dual representation for the asymmetric kernel in self-attention and successfully applies it to modeling and optimization, and demonstrates that the deployed KSVD optimization regularizes Primal-Attention with a sharper singular value decay than that of the canonical self-ATTention.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, a new line of works has emerged to understand and improve self-attention in Transformers by treating it as a kernel machine. However, existing works apply the methods for symmetric kernels to the asymmetric self-attention, resulting in a nontrivial gap between the analytical understanding and numerical implementation. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to represent and optimize self-attention through asymmetric Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD), which is also motivated by the low-rank property of self-attention normally observed in deep layers. Through asymmetric KSVD, $i$) a primal-dual representation of self-attention is formulated, where the optimization objective is cast to maximize the projection variances in the attention outputs; $ii$) a novel attention mechanism, i.e., Primal-Attention, is proposed via the primal representation of KSVD, avoiding explicit computation of the kernel matrix in the dual; $iii$) with KKT conditions, we prove that the stationary solution to the KSVD optimization in Primal-Attention yields a zero-value objective. In this manner, KSVD optimization can be implemented by simply minimizing a regularization loss, so that low-rank property is promoted without extra decomposition. Numerical experiments show state-of-the-art performance of our Primal-Attention with improved efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate that the deployed KSVD optimization regularizes Primal-Attention with a sharper singular value decay than that of the canonical self-attention, further verifying the great potential of our method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides a primal-dual representation for the asymmetric kernel in self-attention and successfully applies it to modeling and optimization.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Transformers are RNNs: Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention\n\n*From Search Query: kernel attention implementation*\n\n*Angelos Katharopoulos, Apoorv Vyas, Nikolaos Pappas, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work expresses the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and makes use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from O(N) to N, where N is the sequence length.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers achieve remarkable performance in several tasks but due to their quadratic complexity, with respect to the input's length, they are prohibitively slow for very long sequences. To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^2\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 1343  (*Influential: 178*)\n\n#### 3. Various Lengths, Constant Speed: Efficient Language Modeling with Lightning Attention\n\n*From Search Query: kernel attention implementation*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention is presented, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption and TransNormerLLM (TNL) is introduced, a new architecture that is tailored to the authors' lightning attention.\n\n**Abstract:** We present Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption. Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Topic-Aware Response Generation in Task-Oriented Dialogue with Unstructured Knowledge Access\n\n*From Search Query: IO-aware attention mechanisms*\n\n*Yue Feng, Gerasimos Lampouras, Ignacio Iacobacci*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results indicate that TARG achieves state-of-the-art performance in knowledge selection and response generation, outperforming previous state of the art performance on Doc2Dial and performing comparably with previous work on DSTC9; both being knowledge-grounded task-oriented dialogue datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** To alleviate the problem of structured databases' limited coverage, recent task-oriented dialogue systems incorporate external unstructured knowledge to guide the generation of system responses. However, these usually use word or sentence level similarities to detect the relevant knowledge context, which only partially capture the topical level relevance. In this paper, we examine how to better integrate topical information in knowledge grounded task-oriented dialogue and propose ``Topic-Aware Response Generation'' (TARG), an end-to-end response generation model. TARG incorporates multiple topic-aware attention mechanisms to derive the importance weighting scheme over dialogue utterances and external knowledge sources towards a better understanding of the dialogue history. Experimental results indicate that TARG achieves state-of-the-art performance in knowledge selection and response generation, outperforming previous state-of-the-art by 3.2, 3.6, and 4.2 points in EM, F1 and BLEU-4 respectively on Doc2Dial, and performing comparably with previous work on DSTC9; both being knowledge-grounded task-oriented dialogue datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. GTA: A Geometry-Aware Attention Mechanism for Multi-View Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: IO-aware attention mechanisms*\n\n*Takeru Miyato, Bernhard Jaeger, Max Welling, Andreas Geiger*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work argues that existing positional encoding schemes are suboptimal for 3D vision tasks, as they do not respect their underlying 3D geometric structure, and proposes a geometry-aware attention mechanism that encodes the geometric structure of tokens as relative transformation determined by the geometric relationship between queries and key-value pairs.\n\n**Abstract:** As transformers are equivariant to the permutation of input tokens, encoding the positional information of tokens is necessary for many tasks. However, since existing positional encoding schemes have been initially designed for NLP tasks, their suitability for vision tasks, which typically exhibit different structural properties in their data, is questionable. We argue that existing positional encoding schemes are suboptimal for 3D vision tasks, as they do not respect their underlying 3D geometric structure. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a geometry-aware attention mechanism that encodes the geometric structure of tokens as relative transformation determined by the geometric relationship between queries and key-value pairs. By evaluating on multiple novel view synthesis (NVS) datasets in the sparse wide-baseline multi-view setting, we show that our attention, called Geometric Transform Attention (GTA), improves learning efficiency and performance of state-of-the-art transformer-based NVS models without any additional learned parameters and only minor computational overhead.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: IO-aware attention mechanisms*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1366  (*Influential: 136*)\n\n#### 7. SODA: Robust Training of Test-Time Data Adaptors\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training optimization*\n\n*Zige Wang, Yonggang Zhang, Zhen Fang, Long Lan, Wenjing Yang, Bo Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** P pseudo-label-robust data adaptation (SODA) is proposed, which leverages high-confidence predicted labels as reliable labels to optimize the data adaptor with ZOO for label prediction and can significantly enhance the performance of deployed models in the presence of distribution shifts without requiring access to model parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Adapting models deployed to test distributions can mitigate the performance degradation caused by distribution shifts. However, privacy concerns may render model parameters inaccessible. One promising approach involves utilizing zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) to train a data adaptor to adapt the test data to fit the deployed models. Nevertheless, the data adaptor trained with ZOO typically brings restricted improvements due to the potential corruption of data features caused by the data adaptor. To address this issue, we revisit ZOO in the context of test-time data adaptation. We find that the issue directly stems from the unreliable estimation of the gradients used to optimize the data adaptor, which is inherently due to the unreliable nature of the pseudo-labels assigned to the test data. Based on this observation, we propose pseudo-label-robust data adaptation (SODA) to improve the performance of data adaptation. Specifically, SODA leverages high-confidence predicted labels as reliable labels to optimize the data adaptor with ZOO for label prediction.

Design from Policies: Conservative Test-Time Adaptation for Offline Policy Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training optimization*\n\n*Jinxin Liu, Hongyin Zhang, Zifeng Zhuang, Yachen Kang, Donglin Wang, Bin Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we decouple the iterative bi-level offline RL (value estimation and policy extraction) from the offline training phase, forming a non-iterative bi-level paradigm and avoiding the iterative error propagation over two levels. Specifically, this non-iterative paradigm allows us to conduct inner-level optimization (value estimation) in training, while performing outer-level optimization (policy extraction) in testing. Naturally, such a paradigm raises three core questions that are not fully answered by prior non-iterative offline RL counterparts like reward-conditioned policy: (q1) What information should we transfer from the inner-level to the outer-level? (q2) What should we pay attention to when exploiting the transferred information for safe/confident outer-level optimization? (q3) What are the benefits of concurrently conducting outer-level optimization during testing? Motivated by model-based optimization (MBO), we propose DROP (design from policies), which fully answers the above questions. Specifically, in the inner-level, DROP decomposes offline data into multiple subsets, and learns an MBO score model (a1). To keep safe exploitation to the score model in the outer-level, we explicitly learn a behavior embedding and introduce a conservative regularization (a2). During testing, we show that DROP permits deployment adaptation, enabling an adaptive inference across states (a3). Empirically, we evaluate DROP on various tasks, showing that DROP gains comparable or better performance compared to prior methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. Tent: Fully Test-Time Adaptation by Entropy Minimization\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training optimization*\n\n*Dequan Wang, Evan Shelhamer, Shaoteng Liu, B. Olshausen, Trevor Darrell*\n\n**TL;DR:** Tent reduces generalization error for image classification on corrupted ImageNet and CIFAR-10/100 and reaches a new state-of-the-art error on ImageNet-C, and optimize the model for confidence as measured by the entropy of its predictions.\n\n**Abstract:** A model must adapt itself to generalize to new and different data during testing. In this setting of fully test-time adaptation the model has only the test data and its own parameters. We propose to adapt by test entropy minimization (tent1): we optimize the model for confidence as measured by the entropy of its predictions. Our method estimates normalization statistics and optimizes channel-wise affine transformations to update online on each batch. Tent reduces generalization error for image classification on corrupted ImageNet and CIFAR-10/100 and reaches a new state-of-the-art error on ImageNet-C. Tent handles source-free domain adaptation on digit recognition from SVHN to MNIST/MNIST-M/USPS, on semantic segmentation from GTA to Cityscapes, and on the VisDA-C benchmark. These results are achieved in one epoch of test-time optimization without altering training.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 828  (*Influential: 300*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. DiJiang: Efficient Large Language Models through Compact Kernelization\n\n*From Search Query: kernel attention implementation*\n\n*Yunhe Wang, Yuchuan Tian, Xutao Wang, Zhicheng Liu, Hanting Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** In an effort to reduce the computational load of Transformers, research on linear attention has gained significant momentum. However, the improvement strategies for attention mechanisms typically necessitate extensive retraining, which is impractical for large language models with a vast array of parameters. In this paper, we present DiJiang, a novel Frequency Domain Kernelization approach that enables the transformation of a pre-trained vanilla Transformer into a linear complexity model with little training costs. By employing a weighted Quasi-Monte Carlo method for sampling, the proposed approach theoretically offers superior approximation efficiency. To further reduce the training computational complexity, our kernelization is based on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to the original Transformer, but with significantly reduced training costs and much faster inference speeds. Our DiJiang-7B achieves comparable performance with LLaMA2-7B on various benchmark while requires only about 1/50 training cost.

Attention Mechanism Enhanced Kernel Prediction Networks for Denoising of Burst Images\n\n*From Search Query: kernel attention implementation*\n\n*Yongming Huang, Yili Xia, Shenyao Jin, Zixiang Xiong, Bin Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning based image denoising methods have been extensively investigated. In this paper, attention mechanism enhanced kernel prediction networks (AME-KPNs) are proposed for burst image denoising, in which, nearly cost-free attention modules are adopted to first refine the feature maps and to further make a full use of the inter-frame and intra-frame redundancies within the whole image burst. The proposed AME-KPNs output per-pixel spatially-adaptive kernels, residual maps and corresponding weight maps, in which, the predicted kernels roughly restore clean pixels at their corresponding locations via an adaptive convolution operation, and subsequently, residuals are weighted and summed to compensate the limited receptive field of predicted kernels. Simulations and real-world experiments are conducted to illustrate the robustness of the proposed AME-KPNs in burst image denoising.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-18\n\n\n\n#### 3. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: IO-aware attention mechanisms*\n\n*Yiran Zhong, Weixuan Sun, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Weigao Sun, Zhen Qin*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

The Hidden Attention of Mamba Models\n\n*From Search Query: IO-aware attention mechanisms*\n\n*Lior Wolf, Itamar Zimerman, Ameen Ali*\n\n**Abstract:** The Mamba layer offers an efficient selective state space model (SSM) that is highly effective in modeling multiple domains, including NLP, long-range sequence processing, and computer vision. Selective SSMs are viewed as dual models, in which one trains in parallel on the entire sequence via an IO-aware parallel scan, and deploys in an autoregressive manner. We add a third view and show that such models can be viewed as attention-driven models. This new perspective enables us to empirically and theoretically compare the underlying mechanisms to that of the self-attention layers in transformers and allows us to peer inside the inner workings of the Mamba model with explainability methods.

Incorporating Test-Time Optimization into Training with Dual Networks for Human Mesh Recovery\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training optimization*\n\n*Xuemiao Xu, Jian Zhu, Qing Zhang, Chengjiang Long, Mingxian Fan, Yongwei Nie*\n\n**Abstract:** Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) is the task of estimating a parameterized 3D human mesh from an image. There is a kind of methods first training a regression model for this problem, then further optimizing the pretrained regression model for any specific sample individually at test time. However, the pretrained model may not provide an ideal optimization starting point for the test-time optimization. Inspired by meta-learning, we incorporate the test-time optimization into training, performing a step of test-time optimization for each sample in the training batch before really conducting the training optimization over all the training samples. In this way, we obtain a meta-model, the meta-parameter of which is friendly to the test-time optimization. At test time, after several test-time optimization steps starting from the meta-parameter, we obtain much higher HMR accuracy than the test-time optimization starting from the simply pretrained regression model. Furthermore, we find test-time HMR objectives are different from training-time objectives, which reduces the effectiveness of the learning of the meta-model. To solve this problem, we propose a dual-network architecture that unifies the training-time and test-time objectives. Our method, armed with meta-learning and the dual networks, outperforms state-of-the-art regression-based and optimization-based HMR approaches, as validated by the extensive experiments.

Joint Optimization of Class-Specific Training- and Test-Time Data Augmentation in Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training optimization*\n\n*Ben Glocker, Chen Qin, Qi Dou, Konstantinos Kamnitsas, Zeju Li*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents an effective and general data augmentation framework for medical image segmentation. We adopt a computationally efficient and data-efficient gradient-based meta-learning scheme to explicitly align the distribution of training and validation data which is used as a proxy for unseen test data. We improve the current data augmentation strategies with two core designs. First, we learn class-specific training-time data augmentation (TRA) effectively increasing the heterogeneity within the training subsets and tackling the class imbalance common in segmentation. Second, we jointly optimize TRA and test-time data augmentation (TEA), which are closely connected as both aim to align the training and test data distribution but were so far considered separately in previous works. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on four medical image segmentation tasks across different scenarios with two state-of-the-art segmentation models, DeepMedic and nnU-Net. Extensive experimentation shows that the proposed data augmentation framework can significantly and consistently improve the segmentation performance when compared to existing solutions.

This method involves transforming long input sequences into compact tensor representations, allowing for efficient attention computation with improved memory and time efficiency. It uses a custom Triton kernel and can be adapted from pre-trained large language models (LLMs) through continued pretraining.\n\n2. **SageAttention**:\n   SageAttention is another implementation that focuses on efficient and accurate quantization of attention mechanisms. It uses 8-bit quantization and a fast self-attention kernel inspired by FlashAttention-style tiling. This approach is optimized for GPUs and achieves significant speedups compared to other attention implementations like FlashAttention2 and xformers.\n\n3. **Block Sparse Attention**:\n   The MIT HAN Lab's work on Block Sparse Attention provides a library of sparse attention kernels that can be integrated into production systems. This approach modifies the base attention mechanism to improve efficiency, which is crucial for handling large sequence lengths and reducing computational overhead.\n\n### Methods for Integrating IO-Aware Attention with Test-Time Training\n\n1. **FlashAttention**:\n   FlashAttention is an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. This approach can be integrated with test-time training by ensuring that the attention mechanism is optimized for the specific memory hierarchy of the GPU, thereby reducing memory bandwidth requirements and improving overall efficiency.\n\n2. **Hierarchical Memory Structures**:\n   Implementing hierarchical memory structures, as suggested by the analysis, can help in balancing efficiency and expressiveness. During test-time training, the model can leverage these structures to manage memory access efficiently, ensuring that the attention mechanism does not become a bottleneck.\n\n3. **Quantization and Kernel Optimization**:\n   Methods like SageAttention and QoQ (W4A8KV4 quantization algorithm) can be used to optimize attention computation during test-time training. These methods reduce the computational overhead by using lower precision quantization and optimizing kernel operations, which can be particularly beneficial when adapting pre-trained models to new tasks or fine-tuning them during test-time.\n\n### Theoretical Guarantees and Stability Analysis for Different Kernel Choices in Attention Mechanisms\n\n1. **Neural Tangent Kernel**:\n   The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the behavior of attention mechanisms. It offers insights into the convergence and generalization properties of neural networks, which can be crucial for analyzing the stability and performance of different kernel choices in attention mechanisms.\n\n2. **Gaussian Kernels**:\n   The use of Gaussian kernels, as in the SOFT (Softmax-free Transformer) approach, replaces the softmax function with a Gaussian kernel, enabling a full self-attention matrix to be approximated via a low-rank matrix decomposition. This method provides theoretical guarantees for maintaining model expressiveness while eliminating the softmax operation, which can be computationally expensive[Analysis].\n\n3. **Weighted Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods**:\n   Employing weighted Quasi-Monte Carlo methods for sampling, as in the DiJiang approach, theoretically offers superior approximation efficiency. This method can provide stability and accuracy guarantees by ensuring that the sampling process is optimized for the specific attention mechanism being used[Analysis].\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Practical Implementations**: Tensorized attention, SageAttention, and Block Sparse Attention offer practical ways to implement kernel-based attention in production systems, focusing on efficiency and accuracy.\n- **IO-Aware Attention**: FlashAttention and hierarchical memory structures are key to integrating IO-aware attention with test-time training, optimizing memory access and reducing computational overhead.\n- **Theoretical Guarantees**: Neural Tangent Kernel, Gaussian kernels, and weighted Quasi-Monte Carlo methods provide theoretical backing and stability analysis for different kernel choices, ensuring that the attention mechanisms are both efficient and expressive.\n\nBy combining these approaches, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are highly efficient, scalable, and perform well across various tasks.\n",

However, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in quality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack key properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or \"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly simple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance, but are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a learnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple trainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention. Experiments show Hedgehog recovers over $99 \\%$ of standard Transformer quality in train-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior linear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs, and up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also enables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear attention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText103 for 125 M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model, where prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops. ## 1 Introduction\n\nLinear attentions are promising methods for improving Transformer efficiency. By replacing the softmax of attention's query and key dot products with kernel function feature maps, linear attentions reduce attention's time and space complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d d^{\\prime}\\right)$ where $n$ is sequence length, $d$ is head dimension and $d^{\\prime}$ the feature map dimension (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Xiong et al., 2021; Schlag et al., 2021). For typical Transformer settings, e.g., with head dimension $=64$ and sequence lengths at 512 to 32 K , this quadratic-to-linear scaling can result in significant speed and memory improvements (Fig. 6). As drop-in alternatives to popular softmax attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), linear attentions not only improve Transformer efficiency when training new models from scratch but can also improve inference efficiency by converting pretrained Transformers into corresponding linear variants (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). Linear attention enables efficient Transformers in a variety of regimes:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: training Transformer models with linear attention with the goal of matching standard Transformer performance, e.g., as tested on benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) classification (Tay et al., 2021) and WikiText-103 language modeling (Merity et al., 2017). - Finetuned-conversion: swapping the attentions of task-specific Transformers and finetuning them to convert existing models into linear versions, with the goal to recover original task performance with improved efficiency (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ed734f9b01ac86d7959fg-02.jpg?height=467&width=1625&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=239)\n\nFigure 1: Hedgehog learns a trainable linear attention feature map designed to mimic standard attention, resulting in expressive yet efficient linear attentions for various Transformer training settings\n\n- Pretrained-conversion: doing the same as finetuned-conversion but for pretrained Transformers such as large language models (LLMs), e.g., to transfer to new tasks and longer contexts. Unfortunately, existing linear attention mechanisms typically fail to match softmax attention in modeling quality. When training from scratch, linear attentions achieve 4-6 worse perplexity ( ppl ) than softmax attention on standard benchmarks such as WikiText-103 (Schlag et al., 2021; Irie et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2023), the equivalent gap between 125 M and 255 M Transformers (Dai et al., 2019). When converting finetuned models, linear attention models require additional quadratic attention modules to close the gap (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). One might worry that such gaps are fundamental; for example, recent theory using the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) showed that high-quality truly subquadratic algorithms to approximate softmax attention may be impossible with large sequence length $n$ (Alman \\& Song, 2023; Keles et al., 2023). We begin by empirically studying why this performance gap exists between standard softmax and proposed linear attentions. We identify two simple properties for softmax attention which prior linear attentions lack: 1) low-entropy \"spikyness\" and 2) dot-product monotonicity. We hypothesize that the quality gap in linear attentions corresponds with lacking these two properties:\n\n- Low-entropy \"spikyness\": Intuitively, we want attentions that attend to relevant tokens while ignoring irrelevant ones via their query-key interactions. We observe these low-entropy or \"spiky\" attention-weight distributions in standard Transformer attention but not prior linear attention maps-where spikes enabled via the scaled dot-product softmax are lost via other feature maps (Fig. 2) - and find this strongly corresponds to Transformer performance (Fig. 4). - Dot-product monotonicity: This property requires that attention weights increase as the dot products of their corresponding queries and keys increase. Intuitively, the lack of this monotonicity can produce unstable gradients during training and finetuning, where increasing the query-key dot product can result in decreasing the attention weight the other way (and vice versa). As a first step to recover these properties, we explore simple feature maps - such as low-degree Taylor polynomial approximations to the $\\exp ()$ function - that satisfy the above two properties (albeit in restricted regimes of bounded query-key dot products). In practice, we find that queries and keys are often bounded, resulting in linear attentions that recover softmax attention's spikiness, monotonicity, and subsequent performance. Unfortunately, while technically linear in sequence length, these polynomial feature maps remain inefficient to compute. They take $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{p+1}\\right)$ time and space, and we find degree $p \\geq 2$ necessary for performance. We thus propose Hedgehog, an efficient-to-compute learnable linear attention trained to capture the spiky and monotonic softmax properties. Unlike prior works that propose a specific kernel function (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and our polynomial feature maps, we learn these feature maps as single-layer MLPs specifically trained to match softmax attention weights. By mapping from $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, we maintain prior linear attentions' $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$ complexity. However, training these mappings via softmax attention weights as cross-entropy soft-labels, we find Hedgehog can match softmax attention weights with much higher fidelity (Fig. 7), producing low-entropy and monotonic weights that match standard attention performance quality. We validate experimentally that Hedgehog's improved expressivity translates to closing the softmax attention performance gap in the three regimes mentioned above:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: we find Hedgehog matches Transformers on standard attention benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) (Tay et al., 2021) task, and closes the linear attention gap by $68.6 \\%$ on WikiText-103 language modeling (improving up to 6 ppl ). - Finetuned-conversion: we find Hedgehog recovers $>99 \\%$ of original model performance on average across bidirectional encoder-only 110M BERT-base models finetuned on GLUE and causal decoder-only 125M GPT models finetuned on Wikitext-103. - Pretrained-conversion: we find Hedgehog enables effective transfer to new tasks and efficient scaling to longer contexts, while frequently outperforming modern subquadratic sequence architectures by linearizing existing pretrained Transformers. A 125M Hedgehog-GPT-2 finetuned on Wikitext-103 achieves a new state-of-the-art 16.7 ppl for subquadratic models of the same size. Finally, we demonstrate that Hedgehog can be scaled up to modern large language models; we convert pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves up to 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model. In contrast, prior linear attentions result in models that struggle to produce coherent text (with 16.5 ROUGE-1 point drops). ## 2 Preliminaries and Related Work\n\nWe provide background on attention computation, describe kernel feature based linear attentions, and finally provide details on existing linear attention mechanisms proposed in the literature.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 3. Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Han Bao, Ryuichiro Hataya, Ryo Karakida*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices is characterized and it is revealed that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n**Abstract:** The self-attention mechanism prevails in modern machine learning. It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

However, they usually suffer from degraded performances on various tasks and corpus. In this paper, we examine existing kernel-based linear transformers and identify two key issues that lead to such performance gaps: 1) unbounded gradients in the attention computation adversely impact the convergence of linear transformer models; 2) attention dilution which trivially distributes attention scores over long sequences while neglecting neighbouring structures. To address these issues, we first identify that the scaling of attention matrices is the devil in unbounded gradients, which turns out unnecessary in linear attention as we show theoretically and empirically. To this end, we propose a new linear attention that replaces the scaling operation with a normalization to stabilize gradients. For the issue of attention dilution, we leverage a diagonal attention to confine attention to only neighbouring tokens in early layers. Benefiting from the stable gradients and improved attention, our new linear transformer model, transNormer, demonstrates superior performance on text classification and language modeling tasks, as well as on the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark, surpassing vanilla transformer and existing linear variants by a clear margin while being significantly more space-time efficient. The code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/Transnormer .\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nExisting methods mainly differ in the design of kernel functions. For example, Choromanski et al. (2020)\nand Katharopoulos et al. (2020) adopt activation function $1+e l u$ to process query and key. Wang et al. (2020) assumes attention matrices are lowrank. Peng et al. (2020) and Zheng et al. (2022) approximate softmax under constrained theoretical bounds. Qin et al. (2022) propose a linear alternative to the attention based on empirical properties of the softmax function. These methods focus on either approximating or altering the softmax operator while preserving its properties. Compared with the vanilla transformer, these methods often trade performance for efficiency, usually resulting in worse task performance. In this paper, we argue that there are two essential reasons leading to such a performance gap, discussed in detail as follows. ## 3 The devil in linear attention\n\nIn this section, we motivate the design principles of TRANSNORMER by providing theoretical evidence for the unbounded gradients, and empirical results showing the adverse influence of attention dilution. ### 3.1 Unbounded gradients\n\nFew work on linear transformers analyzes their gradients during training. Our first key observation is that kernel-based linear attention suffer from unbounded gradients, causing unstable convergence during training. In the following, we highlight the main theoretical results while referring readers to Appendix D for the full derivation. Consider a self-attention module, either vanilla or linear attention. Its attention matrix $\\mathbf{P} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ can be represented in the following unified form ${ }^{1}$ :\n\n$$\np_{i j}=\\frac{f\\left(s_{i j}\\right)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{n} f\\left(s_{i k}\\right)}, f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nVanilla and linear attention differ mainly in their computation of token-wise similarities $s_{i j}{ }^{2}$. In vanilla attention, $s_{i j}$ is computed as:\n\n$$\ns_{i j}=\\mathbf{q}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{j} / \\sqrt{d}, f(x)=\\exp (x)\n$$\n\nwhile for linear attentions, $s_{i j}$ can be decomposed using a kernel function $\\phi$, such that:\n\n$$\ns_{i j}=\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}\\right)^{\\top} \\phi\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right), f(x)=x\n$$\n\n[^1]Given the above definitions, the gradients of the attention matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ is derived as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p_{i j}}{\\partial s_{i k}}=\\frac{f^{\\prime}\\left(s_{i k}\\right)}{f\\left(s_{i k}\\right)}\\left(1_{j=k} p_{i j}-p_{i j} p_{i k}\\right)\n$$\n\nTherefore, for the vanilla attention, the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial p_{i j}}{\\partial s_{i k}}$ is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf^{\\prime}(x) & =\\exp (x)=f(x) \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial p_{i j}}{\\partial s_{i k}} & =1_{j=k} p_{i j}-p_{i j} p_{i k} \\\\\n& = \\begin{cases}p_{i k}-p_{i k} p_{i k} \\in[0,1 / 4] & j=k \\\\\n-p_{i j} p_{i k} \\in[-1 / 4,0] & j \\neq k\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand it is bounded as:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{\\partial p_{i j}}{\\partial s_{i k}}\\right| \\leq \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n\nHowever, for linear attentions, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf^{\\prime}(x) & =1 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial p_{i j}}{\\partial s_{i k}} & =\\frac{1}{s_{i k}}\\left(1_{j=k} p_{i j}-p_{i j} p_{i k}\\right) \\\\\n& = \\begin{cases}\\frac{1}{s_{i k}}\\left(p_{i k}-p_{i k} p_{i k}\\right) & j=k \\\\\n\\frac{1}{s_{i k}}\\left(-p_{i j} p_{i k}\\right) & j \\neq k\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand $^{3}$\n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{\\partial p_{i j}}{\\partial s_{i k}}\\right| \\leq \\frac{1}{4\\left|s_{i k}\\right|}\n$$\n\nSince $\\left|s_{i k}\\right|^{-1}=\\left|\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}\\right) \\phi\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right)^{\\mathrm{T}}\\right|^{-1}$ can be arbitrarily large, the gradient of linear attention has no upper bound. On the other hand, we can also show that the gradient of linear attention has no lower bound ${ }^{4}$ :\nProposition 3.1. $\\forall M>0$, there exists $\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{j} \\in$ $\\mathbb{R}^{d}, j=1, \\ldots, n$, such that:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{\\partial p_{i j}}{\\partial s_{i k}}\\right|>M\n$$\n\nThe unbounded gradients lead to less stable optimization and worse convergence results in our preliminary studies. ### 3.2 Attention dilution\n\nIt is a known property of vanilla attention to emphasize on neighbouring tokens (Titsias, 2016; Qin et al., 2022). However, this property does not directly inherit to the linear transformer variants. To quantify the attention dilution issue, we introduce a metric called locally accumulated attention\n\n[^2]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1e87ac89fa2bec7d4d6fg-04.jpg?height=382&width=1236&top_left_y=259&top_left_x=237)\n\nFigure 2: (a): Comparison of locally accumulated attention scores of different transformer variants. The x-axis denotes ratio of neighbourhood size relative to the input length; the $y$-axis denotes accumulated attention scores inside this neighbourhood for the centering token. The curve for the vanilla transformer model increases more sharply, indicating that the attention scores are more concentrated. Our model greatly alleviates the attention dilution issue for linear models. (b): Qualitative comparison of attention matrices in early model layers. The proposed TRANSNORMER produces more similar patterns to the original vanilla transformer, benefiting to better capture local-global language context, while the linear model suffers clearly from the issue of attention dilution and gets distracted by distant tokens in early layers. score, which measures how much attention scores are distributed within the local neighbourhood of a particular token. For an input sequence of length $N$, consider a local neighbourhood $\\left\\{x_{\\text {start }}, \\ldots, x_{i} \\ldots, x_{\\text {end }}\\right\\}$ centering around token $x_{i}$ of total length $r \\cdot N$, with $r$ the ratio relative to the total input, the locally accumulated attention score for token $x_{i}$ is defined as $l(i, r, N)=p_{i, \\text { start }}+\\ldots+p_{i, \\text { end }}$. A higher score indicates the particular attention layer concentrates on the local neighbourhood, while a lower score tends to indicate the issue of attention dilution, where scores are distributed more evenly to local and distant tokens. For example, $l(i, 0.4, N)=0.6$ means that that $40 \\%$ of the neighbors around $i$ 'th token contribute $60 \\%$ of the attention score. In Fig. 2 (a), we compare locally accumulated attention scores ( $y$-axis) for vanilla transformer and linear transformer, with varying sizes of neighbourhood by ratio (x-axis). We show the average score over each position across the entire sequence. It can be seen that the area under the vanilla model curve is significantly larger than that of the linear model. This provides evidence that the vanilla attention is more concentrated locally, while the linear transformer suffers from the issue of attention dilution. This is further qualitatively supported by Fig. 2 (b), where the attention maps for vanilla model are more concentrated than the linear model. ## 4 Method\n\nBased on the aforementioned observations, we propose a new linear transformer network called TRANSNORMER that addresses the above two lim- itations of current linear transformers.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 15 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: test-time training linear attention, adaptive block computation, attention stability analysis\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

While this has been technically known since the 1960s, no prior work has effectively studied the operations of NNs in such a form, presumably due to prohibitive time and space complexities and impractical model sizes, all of them growing linearly with the number of training patterns which may get very large. However, this dual formulation offers a possibility of directly visualising how an NN makes use of training patterns at test time, by examining the corresponding attention weights. We conduct experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi-task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discuss potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.

Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training linear attention*\n\n*Ofir Press, Noah A. Smith, M. Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though it finds that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation, and introduces a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi).\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 557  (*Influential: 82*)\n\n#### 3.

In this work we empirically investigate several questions related to the efficacy of dropout, specifically as it concerns networks employing the popular rectified linear activation function. We investigate the quality of the test time weight-scaling inference procedure by evaluating the geometric average exactly in small models, as well as compare the performance of the geometric mean to the arithmetic mean more commonly employed by ensemble techniques. We explore the effect of tied weights on the ensemble interpretation by training ensembles of masked networks without tied weights. Finally, we investigate an alternative criterion based on a biased estimator of the maximum likelihood ensemble gradient.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2013\n\n**Citations:** 103  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4.

Wipf, Junchi Yan*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel all-pair message passing scheme for efficiently propagating node signals between arbitrary nodes, as an important building block for a pioneering Transformer-style network for node classification on large graphs, dubbed as NodeFormer.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks have been extensively studied for learning with inter-connected data. Despite this, recent evidence has revealed GNNs' deficiencies related to over-squashing, heterophily, handling long-range dependencies, edge incompleteness and particularly, the absence of graphs altogether. While a plausible solution is to learn new adaptive topology for message passing, issues concerning quadratic complexity hinder simultaneous guarantees for scalability and precision in large networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel all-pair message passing scheme for efficiently propagating node signals between arbitrary nodes, as an important building block for a pioneering Transformer-style network for node classification on large graphs, dubbed as \\textsc{NodeFormer}. Specifically, the efficient computation is enabled by a kernerlized Gumbel-Softmax operator that reduces the algorithmic complexity to linearity w.r.t. node numbers for learning latent graph structures from large, potentially fully-connected graphs in a differentiable manner. We also provide accompanying theory as justification for our design. Extensive experiments demonstrate the promising efficacy of the method in various tasks including node classification on graphs (with up to 2M nodes) and graph-enhanced applications (e.g., image classification) where input graphs are missing.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 146  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 5. Randomized tests for high-dimensional regression: A more efficient and powerful solution\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive block computation*\n\n*Yue Li, Ilmun Kim, Yuting Wei*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a testing procedure that blends the classical $F$-test with a random projection step, and shows that the proposed test achieves sharp adaptive rates and is proved to be minimax optimal.\n\n**Abstract:** We investigate the problem of testing the global null in the high-dimensional regression models when the feature dimension $p$ grows proportionally to the number of observations $n$. Despite a number of prior work studying this problem, whether there exists a test that is model-agnostic, efficient to compute and enjoys high power, still remains unsettled. In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative by leveraging the random projection techniques, and propose a testing procedure that blends the classical $F$-test with a random projection step. When combined with a systematic choice of the projection dimension, the proposed procedure is proved to be minimax optimal and, meanwhile, reduces the computation and data storage requirements. We illustrate our results in various scenarios when the underlying feature matrix exhibits an intrinsic lower dimensional structure (such as approximate block structure or has exponential/polynomial eigen-decay), and it turns out that the proposed test achieves sharp adaptive rates. Our theoretical findings are further validated by comparisons to other state-of-the-art tests on the synthetic data.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

However, most standard neural networks have a fixed function type and computation budget regardless of the sample's nature or difficulty. Adaptivity is a powerful paradigm as it not only imbues practitioners with flexibility pertaining to the downstream usage of these models but can also serve as a powerful inductive bias for solving certain challenging classes of problems. In this work, we introduce a new approach called AdaTape, which allows for dynamic computation in neural networks through adaptive tape tokens. AdaTape utilizes an elastic input sequence by equipping an architecture with a dynamic read-and-write tape. Specifically, we adaptively generate input sequences using tape tokens obtained from a tape bank which can be either trainable or derived from input data. We examine the challenges and requirements to obtain dynamic sequence content and length, and propose the Adaptive Tape Reading (ATR) algorithm to achieve both goals. Through extensive experiments on image recognition tasks, we show that AdaTape can achieve better performance while maintaining the computational cost.

Transformers as Algorithms: Generalization and Stability in In-context Learning\n\n*From Search Query: attention stability analysis*\n\n*Yingcong Li, M. E. Ildiz, Dimitris Papailiopoulos, Samet Oymak*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work formalizes in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem where a transformer model implicitly constructs a hypothesis function at inference-time and identifies an inductive bias phenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by the task complexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner.\n\n**Abstract:** In-context learning (ICL) is a type of prompting where a transformer model operates on a sequence of (input, output) examples and performs inference on-the-fly. In this work, we formalize in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem where a transformer model implicitly constructs a hypothesis function at inference-time. We first explore the statistical aspects of this abstraction through the lens of multitask learning: We obtain generalization bounds for ICL when the input prompt is (1) a sequence of i.i.d. (input, label) pairs or (2) a trajectory arising from a dynamical system. The crux of our analysis is relating the excess risk to the stability of the algorithm implemented by the transformer. We characterize when transformer/attention architecture provably obeys the stability condition and also provide empirical verification. For generalization on unseen tasks, we identify an inductive bias phenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by the task complexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner. Finally, we provide numerical evaluations that (1) demonstrate transformers can indeed implement near-optimal algorithms on classical regression problems with i.i.d. and dynamic data, (2) provide insights on stability, and (3) verify our theoretical predictions.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 120  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 8. Transformers Learn Nonlinear Features In Context: Nonconvex Mean-field Dynamics on the Attention Landscape\n\n*From Search Query: attention stability analysis*\n\n*Juno Kim, Taiji Suzuki*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper studies the optimization of a Transformer consisting of a fully connected layer followed by a linear attention layer, and proves in the mean-field and two-timescale limit that the infinite-dimensional loss landscape for the distribution of parameters, while highly nonconvex, becomes quite benign.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models based on the Transformer architecture have demonstrated impressive capabilities to learn in context. However, existing theoretical studies on how this phenomenon arises are limited to the dynamics of a single layer of attention trained on linear regression tasks. In this paper, we study the optimization of a Transformer consisting of a fully connected layer followed by a linear attention layer. The MLP acts as a common nonlinear representation or feature map, greatly enhancing the power of in-context learning. We prove in the mean-field and two-timescale limit that the infinite-dimensional loss landscape for the distribution of parameters, while highly nonconvex, becomes quite benign. We also analyze the second-order stability of mean-field dynamics and show that Wasserstein gradient flow almost always avoids saddle points. Furthermore, we establish novel methods for obtaining concrete improvement rates both away from and near critical points. This represents the first saddle point analysis of mean-field dynamics in general and the techniques are of independent interest.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: attention stability analysis*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: it replaces the softmax activation with a ReLU, and shows that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training linear attention*\n\n*Carlos Guestrin, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Sanmi Koyejo, Xiaolong Wang, Xinlei Chen, Yann Dubois, Genghan Zhang, Arjun Vikram, Jiarui Xu, Karan Dalal, Xinhao Li, Yu Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-05\n\n\n\n#### 2. Giraffe: Adventures in Expanding Context Lengths in LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training linear attention*\n\n*Siddartha Naidu, Arvind Sundararajan, Samuel Dooley, Manley Roberts, Deep Karkhanis, Arka Pal*\n\n**Abstract:** Modern large language models (LLMs) that rely on attention mechanisms are typically trained with fixed context lengths which enforce upper limits on the length of input sequences that they can handle at evaluation time. To use these models on sequences longer than the train-time context length, one might employ techniques from the growing family of context length extrapolation methods -- most of which focus on modifying the system of positional encodings used in the attention mechanism to indicate where tokens or activations are located in the input sequence. We conduct a wide survey of existing methods of context length extrapolation on a base LLaMA or LLaMA 2 model, and introduce some of our own design as well -- in particular, a new truncation strategy for modifying the basis for the position encoding. We test these methods using three new evaluation tasks (FreeFormQA, AlteredNumericQA, and LongChat-Lines) as well as perplexity, which we find to be less fine-grained as a measure of long context performance of LLMs. We release the three tasks publicly as datasets on HuggingFace. We discover that linear scaling is the best method for extending context length, and show that further gains can be achieved by using longer scales at evaluation time. We also discover promising extrapolation capabilities in the truncated basis. To support further research in this area, we release three new 13B parameter long-context models which we call Giraffe: 4k and 16k context models trained from base LLaMA-13B, and a 32k context model trained from base LLaMA2-13B. We also release the code to replicate our results.\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-21\n\n\n\n#### 3. Bottleneck Transformers for Visual Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive block computation*\n\n*Ashish Vaswani, Pieter Abbeel, Jonathon Shlens, Niki Parmar, Tsung-Yi Lin, Aravind Srinivas*\n\n**Abstract:** We present BoTNet, a conceptually simple yet powerful backbone architecture that incorporates self-attention for multiple computer vision tasks including image classification, object detection and instance segmentation. By just replacing the spatial convolutions with global self-attention in the final three bottleneck blocks of a ResNet and no other changes, our approach improves upon the baselines significantly on instance segmentation and object detection while also reducing the parameters, with minimal overhead in latency. Through the design of BoTNet, we also point out how ResNet bottleneck blocks with self-attention can be viewed as Transformer blocks. Without any bells and whistles, BoTNet achieves 44.4% Mask AP and 49.7% Box AP on the COCO Instance Segmentation benchmark using the Mask R-CNN framework; surpassing the previous best published single model and single scale results of ResNeSt evaluated on the COCO validation set. Finally, we present a simple adaptation of the BoTNet design for image classification, resulting in models that achieve a strong performance of 84.7% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark while being up to 1.64x faster in compute time than the popular EfficientNet models on TPU-v3 hardware. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a strong baseline for future research in self-attention models for vision\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-01-27\n\n\n\n#### 4. Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive block computation*\n\n*Gang Sun, Li Shen, Jie Hu, Samuel Albanie, Enhua Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** The central building block of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is the convolution operator, which enables networks to construct informative features by fusing both spatial and channel-wise information within local receptive fields at each layer. A broad range of prior research has investigated the spatial component of this relationship, seeking to strengthen the representational power of a CNN by enhancing the quality of spatial encodings throughout its feature hierarchy. In this work, we focus instead on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the \"Squeeze-and-Excitation\" (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We show that these blocks can be stacked together to form SENet architectures that generalise extremely effectively across different datasets. We further demonstrate that SE blocks bring significant improvements in performance for existing state-of-the-art CNNs at slight additional computational cost. Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017 classification submission which won first place and reduced the top-5 error to 2.251%, surpassing the winning entry of 2016 by a relative improvement of ~25%.

DeepNet: Scaling Transformers to 1,000 Layers\n\n*From Search Query: attention stability analysis*\n\n*Furu Wei, Dongdong Zhang, Shaohan Huang, Li Dong, Shuming Ma, Hongyu Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to stabilize extremely deep Transformers. Specifically, we introduce a new normalization function (DeepNorm) to modify the residual connection in Transformer, accompanying with theoretically derived initialization. In-depth theoretical analysis shows that model updates can be bounded in a stable way. The proposed method combines the best of two worlds, i.e., good performance of Post-LN and stable training of Pre-LN, making DeepNorm a preferred alternative. We successfully scale Transformers up to 1,000 layers (i.e., 2,500 attention and feed-forward network sublayers) without difficulty, which is one order of magnitude deeper than previous deep Transformers. Remarkably, on a multilingual benchmark with 7,482 translation directions, our 200-layer model with 3.2B parameters significantly outperforms the 48-layer state-of-the-art model with 12B parameters by 5 BLEU points, which indicates a promising scaling direction.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-01\n\n\n\n#### 6. Lumina-T2X: Transforming Text into Any Modality, Resolution, and Duration via Flow-based Large Diffusion Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: attention stability analysis*\n\n*Rongjie Huang, Longtian Qiu, Dongyang Liu, Hongsheng Li, Yu Qiao, Jingwen He, He Tong, Weicai Ye, Tianshuo Yang, Zhengkai Jiang, Wenqi Shao, Junlin Xi, Renrui Zhang, Shijie Geng, Chen Lin, Yuhang Zhang, Xu Luo, Ruoyi Du, Le Zhuo, Peng Gao*\n\n**Abstract:** Sora unveils the potential of scaling Diffusion Transformer for generating photorealistic images and videos at arbitrary resolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, yet it still lacks sufficient implementation details. In this technical report, we introduce the Lumina-T2X family - a series of Flow-based Large Diffusion Transformers (Flag-DiT) equipped with zero-initialized attention, as a unified framework designed to transform noise into images, videos, multi-view 3D objects, and audio clips conditioned on text instructions. By tokenizing the latent spatial-temporal space and incorporating learnable placeholders such as [nextline] and [nextframe] tokens, Lumina-T2X seamlessly unifies the representations of different modalities across various spatial-temporal resolutions. This unified approach enables training within a single framework for different modalities and allows for flexible generation of multimodal data at any resolution, aspect ratio, and length during inference. Advanced techniques like RoPE, RMSNorm, and flow matching enhance the stability, flexibility, and scalability of Flag-DiT, enabling models of Lumina-T2X to scale up to 7 billion parameters and extend the context window to 128K tokens. This is particularly beneficial for creating ultra-high-definition images with our Lumina-T2I model and long 720p videos with our Lumina-T2V model. Remarkably, Lumina-T2I, powered by a 5-billion-parameter Flag-DiT, requires only 35% of the training computational costs of a 600-million-parameter naive DiT. Our further comprehensive analysis underscores Lumina-T2X's preliminary capability in resolution extrapolation, high-resolution editing, generating consistent 3D views, and synthesizing videos with seamless transitions. We expect that the open-sourcing of Lumina-T2X will further foster creativity, transparency, and diversity in the generative AI community.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-09\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on test-time training capabilities, adaptive block-based computation, and stability analysis, here are some key insights and methods derived from the provided sources and additional relevant information:\n\n### Methods for Maintaining Test-Time Training Capabilities in Linear Attention Models\n\n1. **Test-Time Training (TTT) Layers**:\n   The concept of TTT layers, as introduced in the papers, involves treating the hidden state of the model as a machine learning model itself. This allows the hidden state to be updated through self-supervised learning even during test sequences. Specifically, TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP layers have been proposed, where the hidden state is a linear model or a two-layer MLP, respectively. These layers maintain their performance by continuously updating the hidden state through gradient steps on self-supervised loss, which is crucial for test-time training.\n\n2. **Adaptive Learning Rules**:\n   The update rule for the hidden state in TTT layers is a step of self-supervised learning. This adaptive learning mechanism ensures that the model can learn and adapt during test time, which is essential for maintaining test-time training capabilities.\n\n### Techniques for Adaptive Block-Based Computation in Transformers\n\n1. **Block-Based Attention Computation**:\n   Techniques like Lightning Attention-2 and FlashAttention utilize block-based computation to achieve efficient attention mechanisms. Lightning Attention-2 separates attention computation into intra-block and inter-block components, using conventional attention for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This approach helps in achieving true linear complexity while maintaining model quality.\n\n2. **IO-Aware Tiling**:\n   FlashAttention uses an IO-aware tiling strategy to reduce memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. This strategy is crucial for optimizing memory access patterns and improving computational efficiency.\n\n3. **Hierarchical Memory Structures**:\n   Employing hierarchical memory structures can balance efficiency and expressiveness. By carefully managing the GPU memory hierarchy, models can optimize both computation and memory access, which is essential for adaptive block-based computation.\n\n### Stability Analysis and Theoretical Guarantees for Attention Mechanisms\n\n1. **Kernel-Based Methods**:\n   Methods like SOFT and DiJiang provide theoretical backing for linear attention variants. SOFT uses a Gaussian kernel function to replace the dot-product similarity without further normalization, enabling a full self-attention matrix to be approximated via a low-rank matrix decomposition. This approach offers an efficient alternative to traditional softmax while maintaining expressiveness.\n\n2. **Weighted Sampling Approaches**:\n   DiJiang employs a weighted Quasi-Monte Carlo method for sampling, which theoretically offers superior approximation efficiency. This method can improve the approximation quality of attention mechanisms, providing a more stable and accurate representation.\n\n3. **Max-Margin Token Selection**:\n   Techniques like max-margin token selection provide rigorous guarantees for attention optimization. This method ensures that the attention mechanism is optimized to select the most relevant tokens, which can enhance the stability and performance of the model.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Memory Optimization**:\n  Careful consideration of the GPU memory hierarchy is essential. IO-aware designs and hierarchical memory structures can significantly improve the efficiency of the model without sacrificing its expressiveness.\n\n- **Theoretical Foundations**:\n  Kernel-based methods and weighted sampling approaches offer theoretical guarantees that can help in ensuring the stability and performance of the attention mechanisms in production settings.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that not only maintain test-time training capabilities but also optimize computational efficiency, memory access, and stability, ultimately leading to better overall performance.\n",

Fast Transformers via Sketching Polynomial Kernels (Avg. Score: 0.27)\n\n*Praneeth Kacham, V. Mirrokni, Peilin Zhong*\n\n**Published in:**  (2023)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper demonstrates that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality, and develops polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic time and memory complexity inherent to self-attention mechanisms, with respect to sequence length, presents a critical computational bottleneck in the training and deployment of large-scale Transformer-based language models. Recent theoretical results indicate the intractability of sub-quadratic softmax attention approximation under reasonable complexity assumptions. This paper addresses this challenge by first demonstrating that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality. Next, we develop polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees. Crucially, our approach achieves this speedup without requiring the sparsification of attention matrices. We also present a block-based algorithm to apply causal masking efficiently. Combining these techniques, we provide \\emph{PolySketchFormer}, a practical linear-time Transformer architecture for language modeling that offers provable guarantees. We validate PolySketchFormer empirically by training language models capable of handling long contexts. These experiments utilize both synthetic and real-world datasets (PG19, Wikipedia and C4) on Google Cloud TPUs. For context lengths of 32k and GPT-2 style models, our model achieves a 2.5-4x speedup in training compared to FlashAttention, with no observed degradation in quality across our experiments.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/40 (Score: 0.27)*\n\n```\nWe include more details in Appendix F. Models. For real world datasets, we train decoder-only models (only contain causal masked attention layers) of three different scales, mirroring the GPT-2 family (Radford et al., 2019): Small, Medium and Large. For small scale models, we train models using context lengths from 512 to $32 k$. For medium scale models, we only train using context length $8 k$. For large scale models, we only train using context length 2 k . The reason that we did not train longer context length for medium and large scale models is that non-kernel based attention mechanisms (softmax, polynomial) are too slow or go out of memory (OOM). The detailed descriptions of model sizes can be found in Appendix H. We take the recipe of Transformer++ (see (Hua et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023; Gu \\& Dao, 2023) as well). We refer readers to Appendix I for a detailed description of the Transformer++ used by us. If not specified otherwise, we use 10k warmup steps, 125 k total training steps and a linear learning rate schedule. Depending on the original model scale, we also train kernel based attention models (Polysketch and Performer) with $0-3$ additional layers, since these models are significantly faster than non-kernel based attention models so we can afford to train larger models compared to vanilla softmax. It only slightly increases model sizes. Attention Mechanisms. We train models with the following 4 categories of attention mechanisms: (i) Softmax, (ii) Polynomial ( $p=2,4,8$ ), (iii) Polysketch (approximating polynomial attention of $p=4$ ) with variants enabling learned sketches (Section 2.3) or local exact polynomial attention (Section 3.2) or both, and (iv) Performer equipped with our lower triangular multiplication approach (Section 3.1) for handling causal masks. For both Performer and Polysketch, all attention heads share the same $\\phi^{\\prime}$ within the same attention layer. Hyper-parameters. For FlashAttention, we try both block size 256 and $512^{7}$. For our fast lower triangular multiplication approach, we use $b=1024$ for both Polysketch and Performer. We test both sketch sizes $r=32$ and $r=64$ for our Polysketch attention. We use 2048 features for Performer ${ }^{8}$. Pre-training metrics measurements (perplexities) over different context lengths. We train GPT-2 style small scale models equipped with different attention mechanisms on the Wiki-40B (Guo et al., 2020) and PG-19 (Rae et al., 2019) datasets with context length from 512 to 32 k where each training batch contains 1 M tokens. For all kernel based attentions (Performer and Polysketch), we use 13 layers instead of 12. More training details are mentioned in Appendix E. The perplexity results are shown in Figure 2 and training latencies are shown in Figure 4. Due to the space limit, we put all exact numbers in Appendix E including a detailed discussion. We observe that in the setting of 32 k context length, Polysketch (learned + local, $\\mathrm{r}=32$ ) achieves $\\mathbf{2 x}$ speed-up in comparison with FlashAttention of the fastest setup. As shown in Table 2 and Table 3 in Appendix E, when we increase the sketch size $r$ from 32 to 64 , we further reduce the perplexities. In addition, as shown in Table 4, Polysketch (learned + local, $r=64$ ) still keeps $\\sim 10 \\%$ speed-up in comparison with FlashAttention of the fastest setup. In addition, we observed that every kernelbased attention approach (Performer and Polysketch) with fast lower triangular matrix multiplication method almost keeps the same speed across different context lengths given that we use same number of training tokens per step.\n```\n\n#### 2. Generating Long Sequences with Sparse Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.06)\n\n*R. Child, S. Gray, Alec Radford, I. Sutskever*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2019)\t**Cited by** 1488  (*Influential: 137*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces sparse factorizations of the attention matrix which reduce this to $O(n)$, and generates unconditional samples that demonstrate global coherence and great diversity, and shows it is possible in principle to use self-attention to model sequences of length one million or more.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are powerful sequence models, but require time and memory that grows quadratically with the sequence length. In this paper we introduce sparse factorizations of the attention matrix which reduce this to $O(n \\sqrt{n})$. We also introduce a) a variation on architecture and initialization to train deeper networks, b) the recomputation of attention matrices to save memory, and c) fast attention kernels for training. We call networks with these changes Sparse Transformers, and show they can model sequences tens of thousands of timesteps long using hundreds of layers. We use the same architecture to model images, audio, and text from raw bytes, setting a new state of the art for density modeling of Enwik8, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-64. We generate unconditional samples that demonstrate global coherence and great diversity, and show it is possible in principle to use self-attention to model sequences of length one million or more.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/19 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\nFor text and audio, we used two-dimensional attention embeddings, where $d_{\\text {attn }}=2$ and the index corresponds to each position's row and column index in a matrix of width equal to the stride. ### 5.4. Saving memory by recomputing attention weights\n\nGradient checkpointing has been shown to be effective in reducing the memory requirements of training deep neural networks (Chen et al., 2016), (Gruslys et al., 2016). It is worth noting, however, that this technique is particularly effective for self-attention layers when long sequences are processed, as memory usage is high for these layers relative to the cost of computing them. Using recomputation alone, we are able to train dense attention networks with hundreds of layers on sequence lengths of 16,384 , which would be infeasible on modern hardware otherwise. In our experiments, we recompute the attention and feedforward blocks during the backwards pass. To simplify our implementation, we do not apply dropout within the attention blocks, as in (Vaswani et al., 2017), and instead only apply it at the end of each residual addition, as seen in Figure 4. ### 5.5. Efficient block-sparse attention kernels\n\nThe sparse attention masks in 3(b) and 3(c) can be efficiently computed by slicing out sub-blocks from the query, key, and value matrices and computing the product in blocks. Attention over a local window can be computed as-is, whereas attention with a stride of $k$ can be computed by transposing the matrix and computing a local window. Fixed attention positions can be aggregated and computed in blocks. In order to ease experimentation, we implemented a set of GPU kernels which efficiently perform these operations. The softmax operation is fused into a single kernel and also uses registers to eliminate loading the input data more than once, allowing it to run at the same speed as a simple nonlinearity. The upper triangle of the attention matrix is never computed, moreover, removing the need for the negative bias term of (Vaswani et al., 2017) and halving the number of operations to be performed. ### 5.6. Mixed-precision training\n\nWe store network weights in single-precision floating-point, but otherwise compute network activations and gradients in half-precision, as in (Micikevicius et al., 2017). This accelerates our training due to the usage of Tensor Core operations on the V100 GPU. During the gradient calculation, we use\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_befcc9f073998d256dabg-07.jpg?height=985&width=1706&top_left_y=207&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 5. Unconditional samples from ImageNet 64x64, generated with an unmodified softmax temperature of 1.0. We are able to learn long-range dependencies directly from pixels without using a multi-scale architecture. dynamic loss scaling to reduce numerical underflow, and we communicate half-precision gradients when averaging across multiple GPUs. When sampling, we cast the queries and keys to single-precision, as the query-key product can sometimes overflow the max value of half-precision. ## 6. Training\n\nWe use the Adam optimizer with a linear warmup of 5000 iterations and a gradient clipping of 1.0 , both of which we found important for model stability. We use a weight decay penalty of 0.01 . We annealed the learning rate according to a cosine decay as in (Radford et al., 2018). We train on 8 V100 GPUs unless otherwise noted. All embeddings are of a constant dimension $d$, usually one of $\\{256,512,1024\\}$. By default, all linear transforms are to the same dimension, with the exception of the feed-forward network, which projects the input to $4 d$, unless we use \"half-size\" transformations, where it is $2 d$. Additionally, sometimes we halve the size of the query and key transformations. We initialize the token embedding $W_{e}$ from $\\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\frac{0.125}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)$ and the position embeddings from $\\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\frac{0.125}{\\sqrt{d n_{\\text {emb }}}}\\right)$. Within the attention and feedforward components, all biases are initial- ized to 0 and all weights are initialized from $\\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\frac{0.125}{\\sqrt{d_{i n}}}\\right)$ where $d_{i n}$ is the fan-in dimension.\n```\n\n#### 3. Sparser is Faster and Less is More: Efficient Sparse Attention for Long-Range Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.03)\n\n*Chao Lou, Zixia Jia, Zilong Zheng, Kewei Tu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** SPARSEK Attention is introduced, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance and can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models with minimal fine-tuning.\n\n**Abstract:** Accommodating long sequences efficiently in autoregressive Transformers, especially within an extended context window, poses significant challenges due to the quadratic computational complexity and substantial KV memory requirements inherent in self-attention mechanisms. In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/41 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nThe idea is that we can compute step $t$ based on the results from step $t-1$ instead of starting from scratch. Algorithm 2 illustrates the algorithm, where highlighted lines are the main difference from Algorithm 1. We introduce two min-heaps (and maintain the sum of elements for each heap) for tracking the search progress of $(u, w)$ and achieving $O(1)$ evaluation of line 9 in Algorithm 2. Note that each insertion into a min-heap costs logarithmic time in the heap size and each $z_{t}$ introduces at most two more possible ( $u, w$ ) pairs (lines 2-6 in Algorithm 2). Therefore, executing Algorithm 2 over $m$ incremental sets (i.e., $m$ steps) costs $O(m \\log m)$ in total. As Peters et al. [54] have noted, the solution $\\boldsymbol{p}^{*}$ tends to contain only a few nonzeros, leading to small $u^{*}$ and $w^{*}$. Therefore, in practice, we can use partial sort on the $k^{\\prime}=O(k)$ largest values instead of full sort in Algorithm 1, thereby achieving a complexity of $O(m \\log k)$. With respect to Algorithm 2, this change is equivalent to restricting the size of the min-heap $\\mathcal{S}$ to an upper bound for achieving the same reduction in complexity. ### 3.4 Extensions\n\nTraining with fixed-size truncation-free cache Our selection method enables training on extremely long documents that need to be segmented into smaller chunks for recurrent processing. Algorithm 3 illustrates the process. Without introducing any additional truncation strategies or parameters, the algorithm maintains a fixed-size cache benefit by recurrent calculations and produces exactly the same results as calculating without chunking, which is guaranteed by the irreversibility of our selection method. To minimize the memory footprint, we stop the gradients of the cache, thereby pruning the computation graph, as in Transformer-XL [17]. With this algorithm, we can extend the training context length to hundreds of thousands of tokens. Combine with other efficient attention mechanism Our SPARSEK attention can be combined with other sparse attention as long as they have irreversible selection patterns. In this work, we integrate SPARSEK attention with sliding window (SW) attention by default, motivated by the well-known experience that sliding windows are simple yet incredibly strong for language modeling [58, 37]. Specifically, given a sliding window size $w$, we replace $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{K}}_{i}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{V}}_{i}$ in (5) with\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{K}}_{i}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n\\Delta_{i-w} \\boldsymbol{K} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{K}_{i-w+1: i}\n\\end{array}\\right] \\quad \\hat{\\boldsymbol{V}}_{i}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n\\Delta_{i-w} \\boldsymbol{V} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{V}_{i-w+1: i}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nThis combination does not introduce any overhead thanks to our fused Triton kernel. In this combination, SPARSEK attention attention aims at efficiently global (long-range) dependencies modeling, while SW attention is used for modeling local dependencies. Besides, SPARSEK attention can also be combined with linear attention methods, which hypothesize the existence of low-rank structures in attention scores rather than sparsity. From a theoretical perspective, Chen et al. [10] reveal that linear attention and sparse attention capture different attention patterns, and their combination provides a closer approximation to full attention. In this work, we extend their results to SparseK attention and recent attention optimizations [19]. For technical details, please refer to Appendix B.1. Straight-through estimator From TOPK to SpArseK, we employ relaxation techniques to facilitate gradient-based training. Alternatively, the straight-through estimator (ST) [5] can be utilized, i.e., $\\Delta^{\\text {st }}=\\Delta^{\\text {soft }}-\\operatorname{stop} \\_\\operatorname{grad}\\left(\\Delta^{\\text {soft }}\\right)+\\Delta^{\\text {hard }}$, allowing the model to perform true selection. By utilizing the ST method, the model achieves slightly improved efficiency since it bypasses the multiplication of selection scores during the forward pass. Our experimental results indicate that employing ST results in negligible performance degradation. Consequently, this technique shows promise in balancing performance and computational efficiency. ### 3.5 Techniques for Faster and More Stable Training\n\nWe introduce three beneficial modeling tricks discovered in our experiments. We also develop an optimized implementation based on FlashAttention- $2^{2}$ for obtaining practically efficient sparse attention.\n```\n\n#### 4. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.02)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 5. Compositional Attention: Disentangling Search and Retrieval (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Sarthak Mittal, S. Raparthy, I. Rish, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2021)\t**Cited by** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure, and demonstrates that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 14 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: block-based test-time training, adaptive attention stability, kernel attention guarantees\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Current state-of-the-art approaches use a memory of previously processed frames and rely on matching to estimate segmentation masks of subsequent frames. Lacking any adaptation mechanism, such methods are prone to test-time distribution shifts. This work focuses on matching-based VOS under distribution shifts such as video corruptions, stylization, and sim-to-real transfer. We explore test-time training strategies that are agnostic to the specific task as well as strategies that are designed specifically for VOS. This includes a variant based on mask cycle consistency tailored to matching-based VOS methods. The experimental results on common benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed test-time training yields significant improvements in performance. In particular for the sim-to-real scenario and despite using only a single test video, our approach manages to recover a substantial portion of the performance gain achieved through training on real videos.

Test-Time Training Can Close the Natural Distribution Shift Performance Gap in Deep Learning Based Compressed Sensing\n\n*From Search Query: block-based test-time training*\n\n*Mohammad Zalbagi Darestani, Jiayu Liu, Reinhard Heckel*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a domain adaptation method for deep learning based compressive sensing that relies on self-supervision during training paired with test-time training at inference that essentially closes the distribution shift performance gap for state-of-the-art architectures for accelerated MRI.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning based image reconstruction methods outperform traditional methods. However, neural networks suffer from a performance drop when applied to images from a different distribution than the training images. For example, a model trained for reconstructing knees in accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does not reconstruct brains well, even though the same network trained on brains reconstructs brains perfectly well. Thus there is a distribution shift performance gap for a given neural network, defined as the difference in performance when training on a distribution $P$ and training on another distribution $Q$, and evaluating both models on $Q$. In this work, we propose a domain adaptation method for deep learning based compressive sensing that relies on self-supervision during training paired with test-time training at inference. We show that for four natural distribution shifts, this method essentially closes the distribution shift performance gap for state-of-the-art architectures for accelerated MRI.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: block-based test-time training*\n\n*Moritz Hardt, Yu Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling by building a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset and fine-tunes the model on retrieved data at test time.\n\n**Abstract:** Many recent efforts augment language models with retrieval, by adding retrieved data to the input context. For this approach to succeed, the retrieved data must be added at both training and test time. Moreover, as input length grows linearly with the size of retrieved data, cost in computation and memory grows quadratically for modern Transformers. To avoid these complications, we simply fine-tune the model on retrieved data at test time, using its standard training setup. We build a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset. For each test input, our system retrieves its neighbors and fine-tunes the model on their text. Surprisingly, retrieving and training on as few as 20 neighbors, each for only one gradient iteration, drastically improves performance across more than 20 language modeling tasks in the Pile. For example, test-time training with nearest neighbors significantly narrows the performance gap between a small GPT-2 and a GPT-Neo model more than 10 times larger. Sufficient index quality and size, however, are necessary. Our work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Learning to Incorporate Texture Saliency Adaptive Attention to Image Cartoonization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention stability*\n\n*Xiang Gao, Yuqi Zhang, Yingjie Tian*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that texture saliency adaptive attention in adversarial learning, as a missing ingredient of related methods in image cartoonization, is of significant importance in facilitating and enhancing image cartoon stylization, especially for high-resolution input pictures.\n\n**Abstract:** Image cartoonization is recently dominated by generative adversarial networks (GANs) from the perspective of unsupervised image-to-image translation, in which an inherent challenge is to precisely capture and sufficiently transfer characteristic cartoon styles (e.g., clear edges, smooth color shading, abstract fine structures, etc.). Existing advanced models try to enhance cartoonization effect by learning to promote edges adversarially, introducing style transfer loss, or learning to align style from multiple representation space. This paper demonstrates that more distinct and vivid cartoonization effect could be easily achieved with only basic adversarial loss. Observing that cartoon style is more evident in cartoon-texture-salient local image regions, we build a region-level adversarial learning branch in parallel with the normal image-level one, which constrains adversarial learning on cartoon-texture-salient local patches for better perceiving and transferring cartoon texture features. To this end, a novel cartoon-texture-saliency-sampler (CTSS) module is proposed to dynamically sample cartoon-texture-salient patches from training data. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that texture saliency adaptive attention in adversarial learning, as a missing ingredient of related methods in image cartoonization, is of significant importance in facilitating and enhancing image cartoon stylization, especially for high-resolution input pictures.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6.

Robust and Efficient Kernel Hyperparameter Paths with Guarantees\n\n*From Search Query: kernel attention guarantees*\n\n*Joachim Giesen, S. Laue, P. Wieschollek*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work devises a robust and efficient path tracking algorithm that can also handle kernel hyperparameter paths, and uses this algorithm to compute approximatekernel hyperparamter solution paths for support vector machines and robust kernel regression.\n\n**Abstract:** Algorithmically, many machine learning tasks boil down to solving parameterized optimization problems. The choice of the parameter values in these problems can have a significant influence on the statistical performance of the corresponding methods. Thus, algorithmic support for choosing good parameter values has received quite some attention recently, especially algorithms for computing the whole solution path of a parameterized optimization problem. These algorithms can be used, for instance, to track the solution of a regularized learning problem along the regularization parameter path, or for tracking the solution of kernelized problems along a kernel hyperparameter path. Since exact path following algorithms can be numerically unstable, robust and efficient approximate path tracking algorithms have gained in popularity for regularized learning problems. By now algorithms with optimal path complexity in terms of a guaranteed approximation error are known for many regularized learning problems. That is not the case for kernel hyperparameter path tracking algorithms, where the exact path tracking algorithms can also suffer from numerical problems. Here we address this problem by devising a robust and efficient path tracking algorithm that can also handle kernel hyperparameter paths. The algorithm has asymptotically optimal complexity. We use this algorithm to compute approximate kernel hyperparamter solution paths for support vector machines and robust kernel regression. Experimental results for these problems applied to various data sets confirm the theoretical complexity analysis.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2014\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Theoretical Guarantees for Variational Inference with Fixed-Variance Mixture of Gaussians\n\n*From Search Query: kernel attention guarantees*\n\n*Tom Huix, Anna Korba, Alain Durmus, \u00c9ric Moulines*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work aims to contribute to the theoretical study of VI in the non-Gaussian case by investigating the setting of Mixture of Gaussians with fixed covariance and constant weights, and study two sources of error of variational inference in this context when optimizing the mollified relative entropy.\n\n**Abstract:** Variational inference (VI) is a popular approach in Bayesian inference, that looks for the best approximation of the posterior distribution within a parametric family, minimizing a loss that is typically the (reverse) Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical properties of VI have only received attention recently, and mostly when the parametric family is the one of Gaussians. This work aims to contribute to the theoretical study of VI in the non-Gaussian case by investigating the setting of Mixture of Gaussians with fixed covariance and constant weights. In this view, VI over this specific family can be casted as the minimization of a Mollified relative entropy, i.e. the KL between the convolution (with respect to a Gaussian kernel) of an atomic measure supported on Diracs, and the target distribution. The support of the atomic measure corresponds to the localization of the Gaussian components. Hence, solving variational inference becomes equivalent to optimizing the positions of the Diracs (the particles), which can be done through gradient descent and takes the form of an interacting particle system. We study two sources of error of variational inference in this context when optimizing the mollified relative entropy. The first one is an optimization result, that is a descent lemma establishing that the algorithm decreases the objective at each iteration. The second one is an approximation error, that upper bounds the objective between an optimal finite mixture and the target distribution.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Current SGD-based algorithms suffer from either a high computational cost that exponentially grows with number of GCN layers, or a large space requirement for keeping the entire graph and the embedding of each node in memory. In this paper, we propose Cluster-GCN, a novel GCN algorithm that is suitable for SGD-based training by exploiting the graph clustering structure. Cluster-GCN works as the following: at each step, it samples a block of nodes that associate with a dense subgraph identified by a graph clustering algorithm, and restricts the neighborhood search within this subgraph. This simple but effective strategy leads to significantly improved memory and computational efficiency while being able to achieve comparable test accuracy with previous algorithms. To test the scalability of our algorithm, we create a new Amazon2M data with 2 million nodes and 61 million edges which is more than 5 times larger than the previous largest publicly available dataset (Reddit). For training a 3-layer GCN on this data, Cluster-GCN is faster than the previous state-of-the-art VR-GCN (1523 seconds vs 1961 seconds) and using much less memory (2.2GB vs 11.2GB). Furthermore, for training 4 layer GCN on this data, our algorithm can finish in around 36 minutes while all the existing GCN training algorithms fail to train due to the out-of-memory issue. Furthermore, Cluster-GCN allows us to train much deeper GCN without much time and memory overhead, which leads to improved prediction accuracy---using a 5-layer Cluster-GCN, we achieve state-of-the-art test F1 score 99.36 on the PPI dataset, while the previous best result was 98.71 by [16].

N-BEATS: Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: block-based test-time training*\n\n*Dmitri Carpov, Boris N. Oreshkin, Nicolas Chapados, Yoshua Bengio*\n\n**Abstract:** We focus on solving the univariate times series point forecasting problem using deep learning. We propose a deep neural architecture based on backward and forward residual links and a very deep stack of fully-connected layers. The architecture has a number of desirable properties, being interpretable, applicable without modification to a wide array of target domains, and fast to train. We test the proposed architecture on several well-known datasets, including M3, M4 and TOURISM competition datasets containing time series from diverse domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for two configurations of N-BEATS for all the datasets, improving forecast accuracy by 11% over a statistical benchmark and by 3% over last year's winner of the M4 competition, a domain-adjusted hand-crafted hybrid between neural network and statistical time series models. The first configuration of our model does not employ any time-series-specific components and its performance on heterogeneous datasets strongly suggests that, contrarily to received wisdom, deep learning primitives such as residual blocks are by themselves sufficient to solve a wide range of forecasting problems. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed architecture can be augmented to provide outputs that are interpretable without considerable loss in accuracy.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-05-24\n\n\n\n#### 3. Adaptive Transformers in RL\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention stability*\n\n*Shakti Kumar, Jerrod Parker, Panteha Naderian*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent developments in Transformers have opened new interesting areas of research in partially observable reinforcement learning tasks. Results from late 2019 showed that Transformers are able to outperform LSTMs on both memory intense and reactive tasks. In this work we first partially replicate the results shown in Stabilizing Transformers in RL on both reactive and memory based environments. We then show performance improvement coupled with reduced computation when adding adaptive attention span to this Stable Transformer on a challenging DMLab30 environment. The code for all our experiments and models is available at https://github.com/jerrodparker20/adaptive-transformers-in-rl.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-08\n\n\n\n#### 4. Learning Efficient GANs for Image Translation via Differentiable Masks and co-Attention Distillation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention stability*\n\n*Ling Shao, Rongrong Ji, Fei Chao, Yan Wang, Mingbao Lin, Shaojie Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely-used in image translation, but their high computation and storage costs impede the deployment on mobile devices. Prevalent methods for CNN compression cannot be directly applied to GANs due to the peculiarties of GAN tasks and the unstable adversarial training. To solve these, in this paper, we introduce a novel GAN compression method, termed DMAD, by proposing a Differentiable Mask and a co-Attention Distillation. The former searches for a light-weight generator architecture in a training-adaptive manner. To overcome channel inconsistency when pruning the residual connections, an adaptive cross-block group sparsity is further incorporated. The latter simultaneously distills informative attention maps from both the generator and discriminator of a pre-trained model to the searched generator, effectively stabilizing the adversarial training of our light-weight model. Experiments show that DMAD can reduce the Multiply Accumulate Operations (MACs) of CycleGAN by 13x and that of Pix2Pix by 4x while retaining a comparable performance against the full model. Our code can be available at https://github.com/SJLeo/DMAD.\n\n**Published:** 2020-11-17\n\n\n\n#### 5. Rethinking Attention with Performers\n\n*From Search Query: kernel attention guarantees*\n\n*Lukasz Kaiser, Andreea Gane, Valerii Likhosherstov, Lucy Colwell, Afroz Mohiuddin, Xingyou Song, Krzysztof Choromanski, Adrian Weller, Jared Davis, David Dohan, David Belanger, Tamas Sarlos, Peter Hawkins*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce Performers, Transformer architectures which can estimate regular (softmax) full-rank-attention Transformers with provable accuracy, but using only linear (as opposed to quadratic) space and time complexity, without relying on any priors such as sparsity or low-rankness. To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-09-30\n\n\n\n#### 6. Training Quantum Embedding Kernels on Near-Term Quantum Computers\n\n*From Search Query: kernel attention guarantees*\n\n*Johannes Jakob Meyer, Paul K. Faehrmann, Peter-Jan H. S. Derks, Elies Gil-Fuster, David Wierichs, Thomas Hubregtsen*\n\n**Abstract:** Kernel methods are a cornerstone of classical machine learning. The idea of using quantum computers to compute kernels has recently attracted attention. Quantum embedding kernels (QEKs) constructed by embedding data into the Hilbert space of a quantum computer are a particular quantum kernel technique that allows to gather insights into learning problems and that are particularly suitable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. In this work, we first provide an accessible introduction to quantum embedding kernels and then analyze the practical issues arising when realizing them on a noisy near-term quantum computer. We focus on quantum embedding kernels with variational parameters. These variational parameters are optimized for a given dataset by increasing the kernel-target alignment, a heuristic connected to the achievable classification accuracy. We further show under which conditions noise from device imperfections influences the predicted kernel and provide a strategy to mitigate these detrimental effects which is tailored to quantum embedding kernels. We also address the influence of finite sampling and derive bounds that put guarantees on the quality of the kernel matrix. We illustrate our findings by numerical experiments and tests on actual hardware.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-05\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model by integrating block-based processing with test-time training, ensuring stability in adaptive attention mechanisms, and providing theoretical guarantees for kernel-based attention methods, here are some key points and references that can guide the research:\n\n## Methods for Combining Block-Based Processing with Test-Time Training\n\n### Test-Time Training Layers\nThe concept of Test-Time Training (TTT) layers, as introduced in \"Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States,\" involves making the hidden state a machine learning model itself. This allows for continuous adaptation through self-supervised learning during inference. To combine this with block-based processing, one could:\n\n- **Split Attention Calculation**: Similar to Lightning Attention-2, split the attention calculation into intra-block and inter-block attention. For intra-block attention, use conventional attention, and for inter-block attention, use linear attention kernel tricks. This approach can be integrated with TTT layers to adapt the hidden states within each block and across blocks during test time.\n\n- **Hierarchical Memory Structures**: Implement hierarchical memory structures to balance efficiency and expressiveness. This can involve using different levels of granularity for attention within and across blocks, allowing for more efficient and adaptive processing during test time.\n\n### Efficient Update Mechanisms\nTo maintain stability, efficient update mechanisms are crucial. This can be achieved by:\n\n- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Use self-supervised learning objectives to update the hidden states during test time. This ensures that the model adapts continuously without requiring labeled data.\n\n- **IO-Aware Tiling**: Utilize IO-aware tiling strategies, such as those from FlashAttention, to optimize memory and computation. This is particularly important for block-based processing to ensure real performance gains.\n\n## Techniques for Ensuring Stability in Adaptive Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Maintaining \"Spiky\" Attention Properties\nTo ensure stability in adaptive attention mechanisms, maintaining \"spiky\" attention properties is crucial. This can be achieved through:\n\n- **Hedgehog Approach**: Implement the Hedgehog approach, which identifies and maintains low-entropy \"spikyness\" and dot-product monotonicity in softmax attention. This helps in preserving the quality of attention while improving efficiency.\n\n- **Max-Margin Token Selection**: Use max-margin token selection to provide theoretical guarantees for the stability of attention mechanisms. This approach ensures that the attention weights are robust and less prone to overfitting.\n\n### Adaptive Attention Stability\nFor adaptive attention mechanisms, stability can be ensured by:\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: Employ regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and maintain stability. This can include methods like dropout, weight decay, or other forms of regularization that help in stabilizing the attention weights.\n\n- **Self-Supervised Objectives**: Use self-supervised objectives during test-time training to adapt the attention mechanisms. This continuous adaptation helps in maintaining stability by ensuring the model remains aligned with the changing context.\n\n## Theoretical Guarantees for Kernel-Based Attention Methods\n\n### Kernel Methods\nKernel-based attention methods can provide efficient approximations and theoretical guarantees. Here are some points to consider:\n\n- **Linear Attention Kernel Tricks**: Use linear attention kernel tricks, as seen in Lightning Attention-2, to achieve true linear complexity while maintaining quality. These methods often rely on kernel functions that can be theoretically analyzed for their performance and stability.\n\n- **Efficient Computation**: Implement kernel-based methods that provide efficient computation. For example, using kernel functions that allow for fast and memory-efficient exact attention, such as FlashAttention, can offer both practical and theoretical benefits.\n\n- **Theoretical Analysis**: Conduct a thorough theoretical analysis of the kernel-based attention methods. This involves proving bounds on the approximation error, stability, and generalization performance of these methods. References such as \"Transformers as Algorithms: Generalization and Stability in In-context Learning\" can provide insights into such theoretical guarantees.\n\nBy integrating these approaches, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that combines the benefits of block-based processing, test-time training, and stable adaptive attention mechanisms, all while providing robust theoretical guarantees.\n",

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.64)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Recognizing the inherent challenges in extending the context window for LLMs, primarily built on Transformer architecture, we propose a new model architecture, referred to as Zebra. This architecture efficiently manages the quadratic time and memory complexity issues associated with full attention in the Transformer by employing grouped local-global attention layers. Our model, akin to a zebra's alternating stripes, balances local and global attention layers, significantly reducing computational requirements and memory consumption. Comprehensive experiments, including pretraining from scratch, continuation of long context adaptation training, and long instruction tuning, are conducted to evaluate the Zebra's performance. The results show that Zebra achieves comparable or superior performance on both short and long sequence benchmarks, while also enhancing training and inference efficiency.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/44 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\nSmith, and Lingpeng Kong. 2021.

Score: 0.30)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weixuan Sun, Huicai Deng, Dongxu Li, Yunshen Wei, Baohong Lv, Junjie Yan, Lingpeng Kong, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 152  (*Influential: 23*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A linear transformer called cosFormer is proposed that can achieve comparable or better accuracy to the vanilla transformer in both casual and cross attentions and is based on two key properties of softmax attention: non-negativeness of the attention matrix and a non-linear re-weighting scheme that can concentrate the distribution of the Attention matrix.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer has shown great successes in natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing. As one of its core components, the softmax attention helps to capture long-range dependencies yet prohibits its scale-up due to the quadratic space and time complexity to the sequence length. Kernel methods are often adopted to reduce the complexity by approximating the softmax operator. Nevertheless, due to the approximation errors, their performances vary in different tasks/corpus and suffer crucial performance drops when compared with the vanilla softmax attention. In this paper, we propose a linear transformer called cosFormer that can achieve comparable or better accuracy to the vanilla transformer in both casual and cross attentions. cosFormer is based on two key properties of softmax attention: i). non-negativeness of the attention matrix; ii). a non-linear re-weighting scheme that can concentrate the distribution of the attention matrix. As its linear substitute, cosFormer fulfills these properties with a linear operator and a cosine-based distance re-weighting mechanism. Extensive experiments on language modeling and text understanding tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We further examine our method on long sequences and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Long-Range Arena benchmark.

Teaching Temporal Logics to Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: transformer architecture test-time training implementation*\n\n*B. Finkbeiner, Christopher Hahn, M. Rabe, Frederik Schmitt*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Transformer generalized from imperfect training data to the semantics of LTL, and the results were surprising: the Transformer returns the syntactically equivalent trace in 89% of the cases on a held-out test set.\n\n**Abstract:** We show that a deep neural network can learn the semantics of linear-time temporal logic (LTL). As a challenging task that requires deep understanding of the LTL semantics, we show that our network can solve the trace generation problem for LTL: given a satisfiable LTL formula, find a trace that satisfies the formula. We frame the trace generation problem for LTL as a translation task, i.e., to translate from formulas to satisfying traces, and train an off-the-shelf implementation of the Transformer, a recently introduced deep learning architecture proposed for solving natural language processing tasks. We provide a detailed analysis of our experimental results, comparing multiple hyperparameter settings and formula representations. After training for several hours on a single GPU the results were surprising: the Transformer returns the syntactically equivalent trace in 89% of the cases on a held-out test set. Most of the \"mispredictions\", however, (and overall more than 99% of the predicted traces) still satisfy the given LTL formula. In other words, the Transformer generalized from imperfect training data to the semantics of LTL.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 56  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 2. Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: transformer architecture test-time training implementation*\n\n*Moritz Hardt, Yu Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling by building a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset and fine-tunes the model on retrieved data at test time.\n\n**Abstract:** Many recent efforts augment language models with retrieval, by adding retrieved data to the input context. For this approach to succeed, the retrieved data must be added at both training and test time. Moreover, as input length grows linearly with the size of retrieved data, cost in computation and memory grows quadratically for modern Transformers. To avoid these complications, we simply fine-tune the model on retrieved data at test time, using its standard training setup. We build a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset. For each test input, our system retrieves its neighbors and fine-tunes the model on their text. Surprisingly, retrieving and training on as few as 20 neighbors, each for only one gradient iteration, drastically improves performance across more than 20 language modeling tasks in the Pile. For example, test-time training with nearest neighbors significantly narrows the performance gap between a small GPT-2 and a GPT-Neo model more than 10 times larger. Sufficient index quality and size, however, are necessary. Our work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Test-Time Training Can Close the Natural Distribution Shift Performance Gap in Deep Learning Based Compressed Sensing\n\n*From Search Query: transformer architecture test-time training implementation*\n\n*Mohammad Zalbagi Darestani, Jiayu Liu, Reinhard Heckel*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a domain adaptation method for deep learning based compressive sensing that relies on self-supervision during training paired with test-time training at inference that essentially closes the distribution shift performance gap for state-of-the-art architectures for accelerated MRI.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning based image reconstruction methods outperform traditional methods. However, neural networks suffer from a performance drop when applied to images from a different distribution than the training images. For example, a model trained for reconstructing knees in accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does not reconstruct brains well, even though the same network trained on brains reconstructs brains perfectly well. Thus there is a distribution shift performance gap for a given neural network, defined as the difference in performance when training on a distribution $P$ and training on another distribution $Q$, and evaluating both models on $Q$. In this work, we propose a domain adaptation method for deep learning based compressive sensing that relies on self-supervision during training paired with test-time training at inference. We show that for four natural distribution shifts, this method essentially closes the distribution shift performance gap for state-of-the-art architectures for accelerated MRI.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Test-Time Robust Personalization for Federated Learning\n\n*From Search Query: transformer architecture test-time training implementation*\n\n*Liang Jiang, Tao Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies the pitfalls of existing works under test-time distribution shifts and proposes Federated Test-time Head Ensemble plus tuning (FedTHE+), which personalizes FL models with robustness to various test- time distribution shifts.\n\n**Abstract:** Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm where many clients collaboratively learn a shared global model with decentralized training data. Personalized FL additionally adapts the global model to different clients, achieving promising results on consistent local training and test distributions. However, for real-world personalized FL applications, it is crucial to go one step further: robustifying FL models under the evolving local test set during deployment, where various distribution shifts can arise. In this work, we identify the pitfalls of existing works under test-time distribution shifts and propose Federated Test-time Head Ensemble plus tuning(FedTHE+), which personalizes FL models with robustness to various test-time distribution shifts. We illustrate the advancement of FedTHE+ (and its computationally efficient variant FedTHE) over strong competitors, by training various neural architectures (CNN, ResNet, and Transformer) on CIFAR10 andImageNet with various test distributions. Along with this, we build a benchmark for assessing the performance and robustness of personalized FL methods during deployment.

AutoGT: Automated Graph Transformer Architecture Search\n\n*From Search Query: transformer architecture test-time training implementation*\n\n*Zizhao Zhang, Xin Wang, Chaoyu Guan, Ziwei Zhang, Haoyang Li, Wenwu Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Automated Graph Transformer (AutoGT), a neural architecture search framework that can automatically discover the optimal graph Transformer architectures by joint optimization of Transformer architecture and graph encoding strategies and proposes a novel encoding-aware performance estimation strategy.\n\n**Abstract:** Although Transformer architectures have been successfully applied to graph data with the advent of Graph Transformer, the current design of Graph Transformers still heavily relies on human labor and expertise knowledge to decide on proper neural architectures and suitable graph encoding strategies at each Transformer layer. In literature, there have been some works on the automated design of Transformers focusing on non-graph data such as texts and images without considering graph encoding strategies, which fail to handle the non-euclidean graph data. In this paper, we study the problem of automated graph Transformers, for the first time. However, solving these problems poses the following challenges: i) how can we design a unified search space for graph Transformer, and ii) how to deal with the coupling relations between Transformer architectures and the graph encodings of each Transformer layer. To address these challenges, we propose Automated Graph Transformer (AutoGT), a neural architecture search framework that can automatically discover the optimal graph Transformer architectures by joint optimization of Transformer architecture and graph encoding strategies. Specifically, we first propose a unified graph Transformer formulation that can represent most state-ofthe-art graph Transformer architectures. Based upon the unified formulation, we further design the graph Transformer search space that includes both candidate architectures and various graph encodings. To handle the coupling relations, we propose a novel encoding-aware performance estimation strategy by gradually training and splitting the supernets according to the correlations between graph encodings and architectures. The proposed strategy can provide a more consistent and fine-grained performance prediction when evaluating the jointly optimized graph encodings and architectures. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that our proposed AutoGT gains sufficient improvement over state-of-the-art hand-crafted baselines on all datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and wide applicability.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Three things everyone should know about Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: transformer architecture test-time training implementation*\n\n*Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Jakob Verbeek, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Matthieu Cord, Hugo Touvron*\n\n**Abstract:** After their initial success in natural language processing, transformer architectures have rapidly gained traction in computer vision, providing state-of-the-art results for tasks such as image classification, detection, segmentation, and video analysis. We offer three insights based on simple and easy to implement variants of vision transformers. (1) The residual layers of vision transformers, which are usually processed sequentially, can to some extent be processed efficiently in parallel without noticeably affecting the accuracy. (2) Fine-tuning the weights of the attention layers is sufficient to adapt vision transformers to a higher resolution and to other classification tasks. This saves compute, reduces the peak memory consumption at fine-tuning time, and allows sharing the majority of weights across tasks. (3) Adding MLP-based patch pre-processing layers improves Bert-like self-supervised training based on patch masking. We evaluate the impact of these design choices using the ImageNet-1k dataset, and confirm our findings on the ImageNet-v2 test set. Transfer performance is measured across six smaller datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-18\n\n\n\n#### 2. Solving ImageNet: a Unified Scheme for Training any Backbone to Top Results\n\n*From Search Query: transformer architecture test-time training implementation*\n\n*Asaf Noy, Emanuel Ben-Baruch, Hussam Lawen, Tal Ridnik*\n\n**Abstract:** ImageNet serves as the primary dataset for evaluating the quality of computer-vision models. The common practice today is training each architecture with a tailor-made scheme, designed and tuned by an expert. In this paper, we present a unified scheme for training any backbone on ImageNet. The scheme, named USI (Unified Scheme for ImageNet), is based on knowledge distillation and modern tricks. It requires no adjustments or hyper-parameters tuning between different models, and is efficient in terms of training times. We test USI on a wide variety of architectures, including CNNs, Transformers, Mobile-oriented and MLP-only. On all models tested, USI outperforms previous state-of-the-art results. Hence, we are able to transform training on ImageNet from an expert-oriented task to an automatic seamless routine. Since USI accepts any backbone and trains it to top results, it also enables to perform methodical comparisons, and identify the most efficient backbones along the speed-accuracy Pareto curve.

LRRNet: A Novel Representation Learning Guided Fusion Network for Infrared and Visible Images\n\n*From Search Query: transformer architecture test-time training implementation*\n\n*Josef Kittler, Jiwen Lu, Xiao-Jun Wu, Tianyang Xu, Hui Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning based fusion methods have been achieving promising performance in image fusion tasks. This is attributed to the network architecture that plays a very important role in the fusion process. However, in general, it is hard to specify a good fusion architecture, and consequently, the design of fusion networks is still a black art, rather than science. To address this problem, we formulate the fusion task mathematically, and establish a connection between its optimal solution and the network architecture that can implement it. This approach leads to a novel method proposed in the paper of constructing a lightweight fusion network. It avoids the time-consuming empirical network design by a trial-and-test strategy. In particular we adopt a learnable representation approach to the fusion task, in which the construction of the fusion network architecture is guided by the optimisation algorithm producing the learnable model. The low-rank representation (LRR) objective is the foundation of our learnable model. The matrix multiplications, which are at the heart of the solution are transformed into convolutional operations, and the iterative process of optimisation is replaced by a special feed-forward network. Based on this novel network architecture, an end-to-end lightweight fusion network is constructed to fuse infrared and visible light images. Its successful training is facilitated by a detail-to-semantic information loss function proposed to preserve the image details and to enhance the salient features of the source images. Our experiments show that the proposed fusion network exhibits better fusion performance than the state-of-the-art fusion methods on public datasets. Interestingly, our network requires a fewer training parameters than other existing methods. The codes are available at https://github.com/hli1221/imagefusion-LRRNet\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on test-time training in transformer architectures, integration of kernel attention with block processing, and performance comparisons, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Specific Implementations of Test-Time Training in Transformer Architectures\n\n- The concept of test-time training (TTT) is crucial for adapting pre-trained models to out-of-distribution test data. A paper on \"Zero-Shot Image Manipulation Localization with Test-Time Training\" discusses a TTT framework that can be adapted to transformer architectures. This framework involves a shared encoder, a main head for the main task, and an auxiliary head for self-supervised learning. During test-time, the encoder is fine-tuned for each test sample based on a self-supervised objective function, allowing the model to adapt to unseen data.\n\n## Integration Methods for Combining Kernel Attention with Block Processing\n\n- The \"Lightning Attention-2\" paper provides insights into combining kernel methods with block-based processing. It suggests using conventional attention computation within blocks and applying linear attention kernel tricks for inter-block computations. This approach enables efficient handling of long sequences and optimizes GPU hardware usage, which is crucial for memory efficiency and computational complexity.\n\n## Performance Comparisons of Different Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The performance of different attention mechanisms can be evaluated based on stability, memory efficiency, and computational complexity. For instance, the \"Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates\" paper highlights that attention localization through eigenspectrum concentration of query-key parameter matrices leads to more stable attention mechanisms. This is important for ensuring that the model does not suffer from rank or entropy collapse.\n\n- The \"Towards Stable Test-Time Adaptation\" paper compares the stability of different test-time adaptation methods, including the Sharpness-Aware and Reliable (SAR) method, which is shown to be more stable and computationally efficient under various test scenarios.\n\n## Implementation Details, Integration Methods, and Performance Metrics\n\n- **Implementation Details**: Test-time training can be implemented using a two-stage process. During the first stage, the network is trained using both the main loss and a self-supervised loss. In the second stage, the encoder is fine-tuned for each test sample based on the self-supervised objective function.\n\n- **Integration Methods**: Combining kernel attention with block processing involves using block-wise parallel transformer architectures. This approach allows for efficient handling of long sequences by dividing the input into blocks and applying different attention mechanisms within and between blocks.\n\n- **Performance Metrics**: Performance can be evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), stability measures like eigenspectrum variance, and computational efficiency metrics like training and inference time. For example, the \"PatchTST\" model for time series forecasting achieves a low MSE and demonstrates improved computational efficiency by reducing the computation and memory usage of attention maps through patching.\n\n## Memory Efficiency and Computational Complexity\n\n- **Memory Efficiency**: Block-based processing and tiling techniques can significantly optimize GPU hardware usage. The \"PatchTST\" model, for instance, reduces memory usage by segmenting time series into subseries-level patches, which are then encoded by a Transformer. This approach quadratically reduces the computation and memory usage of attention maps.\n\n- **Computational Complexity**: Linear attention implementations can achieve theoretical computational benefits. The \"Lightning Attention-2\" paper shows that using linear attention kernel tricks for inter-block computations can handle unlimited sequence lengths efficiently, reducing the computational complexity compared to traditional attention mechanisms.\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can design autoregressive language models that are more efficient, stable, and adaptable, particularly through the use of test-time training, kernel attention, and block-based processing.\n",

Its first level uses a smaller sliding window pattern to aggregate information from neighbors. Its second level employs a larger window to increase receptive fields with pooling attention to reduce both computational cost and memory consumption. We first evaluate Poolingformer on two long sequence QA tasks: the monolingual NQ and the multilingual TyDi QA.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/12 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/2106.01540, 2021.

The Dual Form of Neural Networks Revisited: Connecting Test Time Predictions to Training Patterns via Spotlights of Attention\n\n*From Search Query: block attention hierarchical test-time training*\n\n*Kazuki Irie, R'obert Csord'as, J. Schmidhuber*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work conducts experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi- task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discusses potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear layers in neural networks (NNs) trained by gradient descent can be expressed as a key-value memory system which stores all training datapoints and the initial weights, and produces outputs using unnormalised dot attention over the entire training experience. While this has been technically known since the 1960s, no prior work has effectively studied the operations of NNs in such a form, presumably due to prohibitive time and space complexities and impractical model sizes, all of them growing linearly with the number of training patterns which may get very large. However, this dual formulation offers a possibility of directly visualising how an NN makes use of training patterns at test time, by examining the corresponding attention weights. We conduct experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi-task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discuss potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.

Test-Time Amendment with a Coarse Classifier for Fine-Grained Classification\n\n*From Search Query: block attention hierarchical test-time training*\n\n*Kanishk Jain, Shyamgopal Karthik, Vineet Gandhi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach for Post-Hoc Correction called Hierarchical Ensembles (HiE) that utilizes label hierarchy to improve the performance of fine-grained classification at test-time using the coarse- grained predictions to significantly reduce mistake severity.\n\n**Abstract:** We investigate the problem of reducing mistake severity for fine-grained classification. Fine-grained classification can be challenging, mainly due to the requirement of domain expertise for accurate annotation. However, humans are particularly adept at performing coarse classification as it requires relatively low levels of expertise. To this end, we present a novel approach for Post-Hoc Correction called Hierarchical Ensembles (HiE) that utilizes label hierarchy to improve the performance of fine-grained classification at test-time using the coarse-grained predictions. By only requiring the parents of leaf nodes, our method significantly reduces avg. mistake severity while improving top-1 accuracy on the iNaturalist-19 and tieredImageNet-H datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art on both benchmarks. We also investigate the efficacy of our approach in the semi-supervised setting. Our approach brings notable gains in top-1 accuracy while significantly decreasing the severity of mistakes as training data decreases for the fine-grained classes. The simplicity and post-hoc nature of HiE renders it practical to be used with any off-the-shelf trained model to improve its predictions further.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Test-time Adaptation for Machine Translation Evaluation by Uncertainty Minimization\n\n*From Search Query: block attention hierarchical test-time training*\n\n*Runzhe Zhan, Xuebo Liu, Derek F. Wong, Cuilian Zhang, Lidia S. Chao, Min Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper aims to address the inference bias of neural metrics through uncertainty minimization during test time, without requiring additional data, by employing the prediction uncertainty of the current data as a signal to update a small fraction of parameters during testTime.\n\n**Abstract:** The neural metrics recently received considerable attention from the research community in the automatic evaluation of machine translation. Unlike text-based metrics that have interpretable and consistent evaluation mechanisms for various data sources, the reliability of neural metrics in assessing out-of-distribution data remains a concern due to the disparity between training data and real-world data. This paper aims to address the inference bias of neural metrics through uncertainty minimization during test time, without requiring additional data. Our proposed method comprises three steps: uncertainty estimation, test-time adaptation, and inference. Specifically, the model employs the prediction uncertainty of the current data as a signal to update a small fraction of parameters during test time and subsequently refine the prediction through optimization. To validate our approach, we apply the proposed method to three representative models and conduct experiments on the WMT21 benchmarks. The results obtained from both in-domain and out-of-distribution evaluations consistently demonstrate improvements in correlation performance across different models. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the proposed method effectively reduces model uncertainty.

M-L2O: Towards Generalizable Learning-to-Optimize by Test-Time Fast Self-Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: block attention hierarchical test-time training*\n\n*Junjie Yang, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen, Zhangyang Wang, Yitao Liang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates a potential solution to this open challenge, by meta-training an L2O optimizer that can perform fast test-time self-adaptation to an out-of-distribution task, in only a few steps, by proposing a proposed framework (termed as M-L2O).\n\n**Abstract:** Learning to Optimize (L2O) has drawn increasing attention as it often remarkably accelerates the optimization procedure of complex tasks by ``overfitting\"specific task type, leading to enhanced performance compared to analytical optimizers. Generally, L2O develops a parameterized optimization method (i.e., ``optimizer\") by learning from solving sample problems. This data-driven procedure yields L2O that can efficiently solve problems similar to those seen in training, that is, drawn from the same ``task distribution\". However, such learned optimizers often struggle when new test problems come with a substantially deviation from the training task distribution. This paper investigates a potential solution to this open challenge, by meta-training an L2O optimizer that can perform fast test-time self-adaptation to an out-of-distribution task, in only a few steps. We theoretically characterize the generalization of L2O, and further show that our proposed framework (termed as M-L2O) provably facilitates rapid task adaptation by locating well-adapted initial points for the optimizer weight. Empirical observations on several classic tasks like LASSO and Quadratic, demonstrate that M-L2O converges significantly faster than vanilla L2O with only $5$ steps of adaptation, echoing our theoretical results.

Design from Policies: Conservative Test-Time Adaptation for Offline Policy Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: block attention hierarchical test-time training*\n\n*Jinxin Liu, Hongyin Zhang, Zifeng Zhuang, Yachen Kang, Donglin Wang, Bin Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we decouple the iterative bi-level offline RL (value estimation and policy extraction) from the offline training phase, forming a non-iterative bi-level paradigm and avoiding the iterative error propagation over two levels. Specifically, this non-iterative paradigm allows us to conduct inner-level optimization (value estimation) in training, while performing outer-level optimization (policy extraction) in testing. Naturally, such a paradigm raises three core questions that are not fully answered by prior non-iterative offline RL counterparts like reward-conditioned policy: (q1) What information should we transfer from the inner-level to the outer-level? (q2) What should we pay attention to when exploiting the transferred information for safe/confident outer-level optimization? (q3) What are the benefits of concurrently conducting outer-level optimization during testing? Motivated by model-based optimization (MBO), we propose DROP (design from policies), which fully answers the above questions. Specifically, in the inner-level, DROP decomposes offline data into multiple subsets, and learns an MBO score model (a1). To keep safe exploitation to the score model in the outer-level, we explicitly learn a behavior embedding and introduce a conservative regularization (a2). During testing, we show that DROP permits deployment adaptation, enabling an adaptive inference across states (a3). Empirically, we evaluate DROP on various tasks, showing that DROP gains comparable or better performance compared to prior methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design focusing on block-based or hierarchical attention mechanisms, test-time training stability, kernel-based attention methods, and memory-efficient implementations, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Block-Based or Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The **Block Transformer** approach is particularly relevant here. It enhances inference efficiency in large language models through hierarchical global-to-local modeling. This method divides the input sequence into blocks and applies attention mechanisms hierarchically, reducing computational complexity and improving efficiency for long sequence processing.\n\n- **QKFormer** is another example that uses a hierarchical spiking transformer based on Q-K attention. This model demonstrates a hierarchical structure that can be efficient for processing long sequences and has shown promising results in terms of performance and efficiency.\n\n## Test-Time Training Stability and Adaptation\n\n- **Adaptive test-time training** involves mechanisms that allow the model to adapt during inference. The concept of \"Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States\" is relevant here, although it focuses on RNNs. For transformers, integrating similar adaptive mechanisms at the block level could enhance stability and performance during test-time adaptation. Researching stability mechanisms and self-supervised learning objectives will be crucial.\n\n- The stability of adaptive training can be improved by using techniques such as regularization and careful tuning of the adaptation rate. This ensures that the model adapts to new data without overfitting or losing its generalization capabilities.\n\n## Kernel-Based Attention Methods\n\n- **Kernel-based attention methods** provide theoretical guarantees and can be integrated with block structures. While the references provided do not directly discuss kernel-based attention in transformers, this concept is generally explored in the context of attention mechanisms. For instance, kernel-based methods can be used to approximate attention weights, providing a more efficient and theoretically grounded approach. Researching papers on kernel methods in machine learning and their application to attention mechanisms would be beneficial.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Attention Implementations\n\n- **FlashAttention** is a relevant reference for memory-efficient exact attention mechanisms. It introduces IO-awareness to reduce memory usage, which can be integrated with block-based hierarchical attention to further improve efficiency.\n\n- The **memristor-based accelerator** for transformer self-attention is another example of a memory-efficient implementation. This approach uses in-memory computing to perform matrix operations, significantly reducing computational latency and memory requirements.\n\n## Theoretical Foundations, Implementation Details, and Performance Metrics\n\n- **Theoretical Foundations**: Understanding the self-attention mechanism and its variants (self-attention and cross-attention) is crucial. The original transformer paper by Vaswani et al. provides a solid foundation for this.\n\n- **Implementation Details**: The Block Transformer and QKFormer models provide detailed implementation strategies for hierarchical attention mechanisms. These models can serve as templates for integrating block-based processing with adaptive test-time training and kernel-based attention methods.\n\n- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluating the performance of these models involves metrics such as perplexity, accuracy in downstream tasks, robustness to variant inputs, and efficiency in training and inference. The Block Transformer, for example, has shown improvements in inference efficiency and scalability with sequence length.\n\n## Investigation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Block-Based Processing\n- Search for existing block attention methods like Block Transformer and QKFormer.\n- Compare these with similar hierarchical approaches to assess efficiency claims and novelty.\n\n### Phase 2: Adaptive Training\n- Investigate test-time training techniques, focusing on stability mechanisms and self-supervised learning objectives.\n- Study the integration of adaptive mechanisms at the block level to ensure stability during adaptation.\n\n### Phase 3: Kernel Methods\n- Examine kernel-based attention papers to verify theoretical guarantees.\n- Assess the challenges of integrating kernel methods with block-based hierarchical attention.\n\nBy following this plan and leveraging the insights from the referenced papers, the researchers can develop a novel autoregressive language model that combines the benefits of block-based hierarchical attention, adaptive test-time training, and kernel-based attention methods, while ensuring memory efficiency and computational feasibility.\n",

Transformers rely on a trainable attention mechanism that identifies complex dependencies between the elements of each input sequence. Unfortunately, the regular Transformer scales quadratically with the number of tokens $L$ in the input sequence, which is prohibitively expensive for large $L$ and precludes its usage in settings with limited computational resources even for moderate values of $L$. Several solutions have been proposed to address this issue (Beltagy et al., 2020, Gulati et al., 2020, Chan et al. 2020, Child et al. 2019, Bello et al., 2019). Most approaches restrict the attention mechanism to attend to local neighborhoods (Parmar et al. 2018) or incorporate structural priors on attention such as sparsity (Child et al., 2019), pooling-based compression (Rae et al, 2020) clustering/binning/convolution techniques (e.g. (Roy et al., 2020) which applies $k$-means clustering to learn dynamic sparse attention regions, or (Kitaev et al. 2020), where locality sensitive hashing is used to group together tokens of similar embeddings), sliding windows (Beltagy et al., 2020), or truncated targeting (Chelba et al. 2020). There is also a long line of research on using dense attention matrices, but defined by low-rank kernels substituting softmax (Katharopoulos et al. 2020. Shen et al., 2018). Those methods critically rely on kernels admitting explicit representations as dot-products of finite positive-feature vectors. The approaches above do not aim to approximate regular attention, but rather propose simpler and more tractable attention mechanisms, often by incorporating additional constraints (e.g. identical query and key sets as in (Kitaev et al. 2020) , or by trading regular with sparse attention using more\n\n[^0]layers (Child et al., 2019). Unfortunately, there is a lack of rigorous guarantees for the representation power produced by such methods, and sometimes the validity of sparsity patterns can only be verified empirically through trial and error by constructing special GPU operations (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2. KERPLE: Kernelized Relative Positional Embedding for Length Extrapolation (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*Ta-Chung Chi, Ting-Han Fan, P. Ramadge, Alexander I.

We propose KERPLE, a framework that generalizes relative position embedding for extrapolation by kernelizing positional differences. We achieve this goal using conditionally positive definite (CPD) kernels, a class of functions known for generalizing distance metrics. To maintain the inner product interpretation of self-attention, we show that a CPD kernel can be transformed into a PD kernel by adding a constant offset. This offset is implicitly absorbed in the Softmax normalization during self-attention. The diversity of CPD kernels allows us to derive various RPEs that enable length extrapolation in a principled way. Experiments demonstrate that the logarithmic variant achieves excellent extrapolation performance on three large language modeling datasets. Our implementation and pretrained checkpoints are released at~\\url{https://github.com/chijames/KERPLE.git}.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/37 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nIn Biocomputing 2002, pages 564-575.

Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention (Avg.

For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/38 (Score: 0.82)*\n\n```\nThis is illustrated on Fig. 2, bottom left. ## 3 Method\n\nWe develop an efficient CUDA kernel written in Triton (Tillet et al., 2019) that maintains the careful memory management of FlashAttention but can handle a causal structure defined through an arbitrary indexing of the keys and the queries. In the case where this indexing consists of a binary decision to drop or not the head of a query/key, this corresponds to our QK-sparse kernels as described in $\\S$ 3.1. In the case where the indexing corresponds to bucket indices e.g. obtained from hashing, this corresponds to our Hash-sparse kernel described in \u00a7 3.2. Notations. Input tensors for attention as in Vaswani et al. (2017) are of shape $B \\times H \\times T \\times D$, with $B$ being the batch size, $H$ the number of heads, $T$ the sequence length, and $D$ the dimension per head. In the following we take the view of a single head and instead consider a query tensor $\\boldsymbol{Q}$ of shape $T_{Q} \\times D$, and a key $\\boldsymbol{K}$ and value $\\boldsymbol{V}$ tensors of shapes $T_{K V} \\times D$. The algorithms described below will be run in parallel for all elements of the Cartesian product $B \\times H$.

This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.79)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n#### 5. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.69)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.69)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: kernel attention theoretical guarantees memory efficiency\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Kernel Stein Discrepancy thinning: a theoretical perspective of pathologies and a practical fix with regularization\n\n*From Search Query: kernel attention theoretical guarantees memory efficiency*\n\n*Cl'ement B'enard, B. Staber, S. Veiga*\n\n**TL;DR:** A theoretical analysis of several empirical pathologies of Stein thinning, to clearly identify the mechanisms at stake, and suggest improved strategies, and introduces the regularization of the algorithm to alleviate the identified pathologies.\n\n**Abstract:** Stein thinning is a promising algorithm proposed by (Riabiz et al., 2022) for post-processing outputs of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The main principle is to greedily minimize the kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD), which only requires the gradient of the log-target distribution, and is thus well-suited for Bayesian inference. The main advantages of Stein thinning are the automatic remove of the burn-in period, the correction of the bias introduced by recent MCMC algorithms, and the asymptotic properties of convergence towards the target distribution. Nevertheless, Stein thinning suffers from several empirical pathologies, which may result in poor approximations, as observed in the literature. In this article, we conduct a theoretical analysis of these pathologies, to clearly identify the mechanisms at stake, and suggest improved strategies. Then, we introduce the regularized Stein thinning algorithm to alleviate the identified pathologies. Finally, theoretical guarantees and extensive experiments show the high efficiency of the proposed algorithm. An implementation of regularized Stein thinning as the kernax library in python and JAX is available at https://gitlab.com/drti/kernax.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Theoretical Guarantees for Variational Inference with Fixed-Variance Mixture of Gaussians\n\n*From Search Query: kernel attention theoretical guarantees memory efficiency*\n\n*Tom Huix, Anna Korba, Alain Durmus, \u00c9ric Moulines*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work aims to contribute to the theoretical study of VI in the non-Gaussian case by investigating the setting of Mixture of Gaussians with fixed covariance and constant weights, and study two sources of error of variational inference in this context when optimizing the mollified relative entropy.\n\n**Abstract:** Variational inference (VI) is a popular approach in Bayesian inference, that looks for the best approximation of the posterior distribution within a parametric family, minimizing a loss that is typically the (reverse) Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical properties of VI have only received attention recently, and mostly when the parametric family is the one of Gaussians. This work aims to contribute to the theoretical study of VI in the non-Gaussian case by investigating the setting of Mixture of Gaussians with fixed covariance and constant weights. In this view, VI over this specific family can be casted as the minimization of a Mollified relative entropy, i.e. the KL between the convolution (with respect to a Gaussian kernel) of an atomic measure supported on Diracs, and the target distribution. The support of the atomic measure corresponds to the localization of the Gaussian components. Hence, solving variational inference becomes equivalent to optimizing the positions of the Diracs (the particles), which can be done through gradient descent and takes the form of an interacting particle system. We study two sources of error of variational inference in this context when optimizing the mollified relative entropy. The first one is an optimization result, that is a descent lemma establishing that the algorithm decreases the objective at each iteration. The second one is an approximation error, that upper bounds the objective between an optimal finite mixture and the target distribution.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. FlashAttention-2: Faster Attention with Better Parallelism and Work Partitioning\n\n*From Search Query: kernel attention theoretical guarantees memory efficiency*\n\n*Tri Dao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of non-matmul FLOPs, and parallelize the attention computation, even for a single head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through shared memory.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling Transformers to longer sequence lengths has been a major problem in the last several years, promising to improve performance in language modeling and high-resolution image understanding, as well as to unlock new applications in code, audio, and video generation. The attention layer is the main bottleneck in scaling to longer sequences, as its runtime and memory increase quadratically in the sequence length. FlashAttention exploits the asymmetric GPU memory hierarchy to bring significant memory saving (linear instead of quadratic) and runtime speedup (2-4$\\times$ compared to optimized baselines), with no approximation. However, FlashAttention is still not nearly as fast as optimized matrix-multiply (GEMM) operations, reaching only 25-40\\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s. We observe that the inefficiency is due to suboptimal work partitioning between different thread blocks and warps on the GPU, causing either low-occupancy or unnecessary shared memory reads/writes. We propose FlashAttention-2, with better work partitioning to address these issues. In particular, we (1) tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of non-matmul FLOPs (2) parallelize the attention computation, even for a single head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and (3) within each thread block, distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through shared memory. These yield around 2$\\times$ speedup compared to FlashAttention, reaching 50-73\\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s on A100 and getting close to the efficiency of GEMM operations. We empirically validate that when used end-to-end to train GPT-style models, FlashAttention-2 reaches training speed of up to 225 TFLOPs/s per A100 GPU (72\\% model FLOPs utilization).\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 678  (*Influential: 70*)\n\n#### 4.

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 1320  (*Influential: 183*)\n\n#### 5. Various Lengths, Constant Speed: Efficient Language Modeling with Lightning Attention\n\n*From Search Query: kernel attention theoretical guarantees memory efficiency*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention is presented, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption and TransNormerLLM (TNL) is introduced, a new architecture that is tailored to the authors' lightning attention.\n\n**Abstract:** We present Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption. Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

By storing LSH hash tables and running attention computation on the CPU, MagicPIG can handle longer contexts and larger batch sizes efficiently.\n\n2. **Kernel SGD and Memory Efficiency**:\n   The paper on \"Truncated Kernel Stochastic Gradient Descent on Spheres\" discusses methods to reduce memory requirements for kernel-based algorithms. By leveraging low-rank approximations and preconditioning iterative approaches, these methods can achieve optimal scalability for batch data processing scenarios, which can be adapted for attention mechanisms to improve memory efficiency.\n\n## Integration of Kernel Methods with Block-Based Architectures\n\n1. **Block-Based Attention and Kernel Methods**:\n   While the existing literature on block-based attention mechanisms (such as Length-Extrapolatable Transformer and Poolingformer) does not explicitly integrate kernel methods, the theoretical foundations from NTK and causal kernel descent can be applied to these architectures. For instance, using the NTK to analyze the attention mechanisms within block-based architectures could provide a more robust and theoretically grounded approach to handling long sequences.\n\n2. **Combining Block Attention with Kernel Methods**:\n   To integrate block attention with kernel methods, one could use the kernel-based attention mechanisms within each block. For example, using the causal kernel descent method within each block of a Length-Extrapolatable Transformer could enhance the model's ability to learn contextual representations efficiently while maintaining theoretical guarantees. This integration would require careful analysis of the memory complexity and computational cost, leveraging insights from papers like \"MagicPIG\" and \"Truncated Kernel Stochastic Gradient Descent on Spheres\".\n\n## Performance Comparisons and Mathematical Proofs\n\n1. **Theoretical Bounds and Proofs**:\n   The papers mentioned above provide rigorous mathematical proofs and theoretical bounds. For instance, the NTK paper offers proofs that the training dynamics of wide neural networks are equivalent to kernel gradient descent, and the \"Transformers are Universal In-context Learners\" paper includes detailed mathematical proofs to establish the universality of transformers as in-context learners.\n\n2. **Performance Comparisons**:\n   Experimental results from papers like \"MagicPIG\" and \"Transformers are Universal In-context Learners\" validate the theoretical findings and suggest their applicability to real-world tasks. These results can be used to compare the performance of kernel-based attention methods with standard attention mechanisms, highlighting any improvements in memory efficiency, computational cost, and overall performance.\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can develop a novel autoregressive language model block that leverages kernel-based attention methods, ensuring strong theoretical foundations, memory efficiency, and improved performance.\n",

It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n#### 3. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.61)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 0.55)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

Towards Stable Test-Time Adaptation in Dynamic Wild World\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training kernel methods stability*\n\n*Shuaicheng Niu, Jiaxiang Wu, Yifan Zhang, Z. Wen, Yaofo Chen, P. Zhao, Mingkui Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) has shown to be effective at tackling distribution shifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model on test samples. However, the online model updating of TTA may be unstable and this is often a key obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world. Specifically, TTA may fail to improve or even harm the model performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch sizes, and 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts, which are quite common in practice. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, \\ie, group or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases. By digging into the failure cases, we find that certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disturb the model adaption and result in collapsed trivial solutions, \\ie, assigning the same class label for all samples. To address the above collapse issue, we propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Promising results demonstrate that SAR performs more stably over prior methods and is computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 180  (*Influential: 57*)\n\n#### 2. OST: Improving Generalization of DeepFake Detection via One-Shot Test-Time Training\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training kernel methods stability*\n\n*Liang Chen, Yong Zhang, Yibing Song, Jue Wang, Lingqiao Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new learning paradigm specially designed for the generalizable deepfake detection task is introduced, which synthesizes pseudo-training samples from each test image and creates a test-time training objective to update the model.\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art deepfake detectors perform well in identifying forgeries when they are evaluated on a test set similar to the training set, but struggle to maintain good performance when the test forgeries exhibit different characteristics from the training images, e.g., forgeries are created by unseen deepfake methods. Such a weak generalization capability hinders the applicability of current deepfake detectors. In this paper, we introduce a new learning paradigm specially designed for the generalizable deepfake detection task. Our key idea is to construct a testsample-specific auxiliary task to update the model before applying it to the sample. Specifically, we synthesize pseudo-training samples from each test image and create a test-time training objective to update the model. Moreover, we propose to leverage meta-learning to ensure that a fast single-step test-time gradient descent, dubbed one-shot test-time training (OST), can be sufficient for good deepfake detection performance. Extensive results across several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach performs favorably against existing arts in terms of generalization to unseen data and robustness to different post-processing steps.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 48  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 3. Test-time Training for Matching-based Video Object Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training kernel methods stability*\n\n*Juliette Bertrand, Giorgos Kordopatis-Zilos, Yannis Kalantidis, Giorgos Tolias*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on matching-based VOS under distribution shifts such as video corruptions, stylization, and sim-to-real transfer and explores test-time training strategies that are agnostic to the specific task as well as strategies that are designed specifically for VOS.\n\n**Abstract:** The video object segmentation (VOS) task involves the segmentation of an object over time based on a single initial mask. Current state-of-the-art approaches use a memory of previously processed frames and rely on matching to estimate segmentation masks of subsequent frames. Lacking any adaptation mechanism, such methods are prone to test-time distribution shifts. This work focuses on matching-based VOS under distribution shifts such as video corruptions, stylization, and sim-to-real transfer. We explore test-time training strategies that are agnostic to the specific task as well as strategies that are designed specifically for VOS. This includes a variant based on mask cycle consistency tailored to matching-based VOS methods. The experimental results on common benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed test-time training yields significant improvements in performance. In particular for the sim-to-real scenario and despite using only a single test video, our approach manages to recover a substantial portion of the performance gain achieved through training on real videos.

Test-Time Training Can Close the Natural Distribution Shift Performance Gap in Deep Learning Based Compressed Sensing\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training kernel methods stability*\n\n*Mohammad Zalbagi Darestani, Jiayu Liu, Reinhard Heckel*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a domain adaptation method for deep learning based compressive sensing that relies on self-supervision during training paired with test-time training at inference that essentially closes the distribution shift performance gap for state-of-the-art architectures for accelerated MRI.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning based image reconstruction methods outperform traditional methods. However, neural networks suffer from a performance drop when applied to images from a different distribution than the training images. For example, a model trained for reconstructing knees in accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does not reconstruct brains well, even though the same network trained on brains reconstructs brains perfectly well. Thus there is a distribution shift performance gap for a given neural network, defined as the difference in performance when training on a distribution $P$ and training on another distribution $Q$, and evaluating both models on $Q$. In this work, we propose a domain adaptation method for deep learning based compressive sensing that relies on self-supervision during training paired with test-time training at inference. We show that for four natural distribution shifts, this method essentially closes the distribution shift performance gap for state-of-the-art architectures for accelerated MRI.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5.

Efros*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper uses masked autoencoders to improve generalization on many visual benchmarks for distribution shifts and characterize this improvement in terms of the bias-variance trade-off.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time training adapts to a new test distribution on the fly by optimizing a model for each test input using self-supervision. In this paper, we use masked autoencoders for this one-sample learning problem. Empirically, our simple method improves generalization on many visual benchmarks for distribution shifts. Theoretically, we characterize this improvement in terms of the bias-variance trade-off.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 125  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Robustifying Generalizable Implicit Shape Networks with a Tunable Non-Parametric Model\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training kernel methods stability*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Feedforward generalizable models for implicit shape reconstruction from unoriented point cloud present multiple advantages, including high performance and inference speed. However, they still suffer from generalization issues, ranging from underfitting the input point cloud, to misrepresenting samples outside of the training data distribution, or with toplogies unseen at training. We propose here an efficient mechanism to remedy some of these limitations at test time. We combine the inter-shape data prior of the network with an intra-shape regularization prior of a Nystr\\\"om Kernel Ridge Regression, that we further adapt by fitting its hyperprameters to the current shape. The resulting shape function defined in a shape specific Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space benefits from desirable stability and efficiency properties and grants a shape adaptive expressiveness-robustness trade-off. We demonstrate the improvement obtained through our method with respect to baselines and the state-of-the-art using synthetic and real data.\n\n**Conference:** robustifying-generalizable-implicit-shape\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on test-time training mechanisms, stability analysis for kernel-based attention, and adaptive mechanisms in transformer architectures, here are some key points and references that can be useful:\n\n## Test-Time Training Mechanisms in Attention Models\n\n- **Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)**: While the provided sources do not directly discuss TTA in the context of attention models, the concept of TTA can be adapted from other domains. For instance, the paper on \"Test-Time Intensity Consistency Adaptation for Shadow Detection\" discusses adapting pre-trained models at test time using target task data without additional proxy tasks or models. This approach can be explored for attention models by adapting the attention mechanisms using the test data to enhance generalization.\n\n## Stability Analysis for Kernel-Based Attention\n\n- **Performers and FAVOR+**: These methods provide strong theoretical guarantees for kernel-based attention mechanisms. Performers offer unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence, and low estimation variance, ensuring stability and efficiency[Analysis Note].\n- **Lightning Attention-2**: This method introduces block-based processing and linear attention kernel tricks, which can be theoretically justified for efficiency and stability. It also employs tiling techniques to optimize hardware usage, which can contribute to stable and efficient computation[Analysis Note].\n\n## Adaptive Mechanisms in Transformer Architectures\n\n- **Block-Based Processing**: Methods like Lightning Attention-2 and Sparse Flash Attention utilize block-based processing to separate intra-block and inter-block attention computation. This approach can be adapted to include adaptive mechanisms, such as dynamically adjusting block sizes or attention weights based on the input data, to enhance performance and stability[Analysis Note].\n- **Kernel Methods Integration**: Combining kernel methods with block processing can enhance the adaptability of the model. For example, using kernel-based attention for inter-block computations while maintaining traditional attention for intra-block computations can provide a balanced approach to adaptation and stability[Analysis Note].\n\n## Theoretical Guarantees for Stability\n\n- **Kernel Methods**: Theoretical guarantees provided by kernel methods like Performers and FAVOR+ ensure that the attention mechanisms are stable and efficient. These guarantees include unbiased estimation, uniform convergence, and low estimation variance[Analysis Note].\n\n## Memory Efficiency During Adaptation\n\n- **Tiling and Block Processing**: Techniques like tiling and block processing are crucial for memory efficiency. These methods optimize the use of GPU hardware and reduce computational complexity, leading to significant runtime speedups without additional overhead[Analysis Note].\n- **Sparse Flash Attention**: This method highlights implementations with no computational complexity overhead and multi-fold runtime speedups, which can be integrated with kernel methods to ensure memory efficiency during adaptation[Analysis Note].\n\n## Performance Analysis\n\n- **Performance Comparison**: Evaluating the performance of different attention mechanisms, such as comparing the baseline model with kernel-based attention and block-based processing, can provide insights into the effectiveness of these methods. For instance, the performance analysis in the context of shadow detection shows significant improvements when using test-time adaptation and kernel-based methods.\n\nIn summary, to achieve the goal of improving autoregressive language model design, researchers should focus on integrating kernel-based attention methods with block-based processing, ensuring theoretical guarantees for stability, and optimizing memory efficiency through tiling and sparse attention techniques. Adaptive mechanisms at test time can further enhance the model's performance and generalization capabilities.\n",

    "abstract": "An enhancement of FastTTTLinear that integrates block-based processing with adaptive test-time training capabilities, using a novel hierarchical attention mechanism that combines intra-block and inter-block attention with theoretical guarantees. The design achieves linear complexity while maintaining model expressiveness through kernel-based attention methods and stable test-time adaptation.",
