The pseudo-code and implementation guidelines are detailed, making the design easy to understand and follow.\n\n#### 2. Innovation\nThe proposal introduces innovative improvements by leveraging GLA and RWKV, which are not commonly integrated into existing autoregressive models. The use of data-dependent gates in GLA to maintain linear complexity while enhancing expressiveness is a novel approach. Compared to existing research, this proposal stands out by focusing on test-time training capabilities alongside efficiency improvements.\n\n#### 3. Feasibility\nThe design appears feasible within the given framework, leveraging existing components like linear projections and convolutional augmentations. The pseudo-code provided demonstrates a clear path to implementation, suggesting that the proposed modifications can be integrated into the current model architecture.\n\n#### 4. Scalability\nThe design is likely to scale efficiently with larger models or more data due to its linear complexity in both time and space. The integration of linear attention mechanisms should allow the model to handle longer sequences without a significant increase in computational resources.\n\n#### 5.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

Here we propose a simple network architecture, gMLP, based on MLPs with gating, and show that it can perform as well as Transformers in key language and vision applications. Our comparisons show that self-attention is not critical for Vision Transformers, as gMLP can achieve the same accuracy. For BERT, our model achieves parity with Transformers on pretraining perplexity and is better on some downstream NLP tasks. On finetuning tasks where gMLP performs worse, making the gMLP model substantially larger can close the gap with Transformers. In general, our experiments show that gMLP can scale as well as Transformers over increased data and compute.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/21 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn CVPR, 2018.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

While the capabilities of SSMs have been primarily investigated through experimental comparisons, theoretical understanding of SSMs is still limited. In particular, there is a lack of statistical and quantitative evaluation of whether SSM can replace Transformers. In this paper, we theoretically explore in which tasks SSMs can be alternatives of Transformers from the perspective of estimating sequence-to-sequence functions. We consider the setting where the target function has direction-dependent smoothness and prove that SSMs can estimate such functions with the same convergence rate as Transformers. Additionally, we prove that SSMs can estimate the target function, even if the smoothness changes depending on the input sequence, as well as Transformers. Our results show the possibility that SSMs can replace Transformers when estimating the functions in certain classes that appear in practice.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/38 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nY.

While All-MLP ar-003 chitectures have demonstrated reasonable per-004 formance in computer vision and garnered re-005 cent interest, we argue that making them ef-006 fective in NLP applications is still an uphill 007 battle.

Hence, interleaving sample-dependent 018 and input-local self-attention with persistent 019 Mixer modules can be an effective strategy. 020 Additionally, we propose compositional remix-021 ing, a new way of baking compositional op-022 erators (multiplicative and subtractive compo-023 sition) within the mixing process to improve 024 the expressiveness of the model.

Omni-Dimensional Dynamic Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Convolution*\n\n*Chao Li, Aojun Zhou, Anbang Yao*\n\n**TL;DR:** Intriguingly, thanks to its improved feature learning ability, ODConv with even one single kernel can compete with or outperform existing dynamic convolution counterparts with multiple kernels, substantially reducing extra parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning a single static convolutional kernel in each convolutional layer is the common training paradigm of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Instead, recent research in dynamic convolution shows that learning a linear combination of $n$ convolutional kernels weighted with their input-dependent attentions can significantly improve the accuracy of light-weight CNNs, while maintaining efficient inference. However, we observe that existing works endow convolutional kernels with the dynamic property through one dimension (regarding the convolutional kernel number) of the kernel space, but the other three dimensions (regarding the spatial size, the input channel number and the output channel number for each convolutional kernel) are overlooked. Inspired by this, we present Omni-dimensional Dynamic Convolution (ODConv), a more generalized yet elegant dynamic convolution design, to advance this line of research. ODConv leverages a novel multi-dimensional attention mechanism with a parallel strategy to learn complementary attentions for convolutional kernels along all four dimensions of the kernel space at any convolutional layer. As a drop-in replacement of regular convolutions, ODConv can be plugged into many CNN architectures. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and MS-COCO datasets show that ODConv brings solid accuracy boosts for various prevailing CNN backbones including both light-weight and large ones, e.g., 3.77%~5.71%|1.86%~3.72% absolute top-1 improvements to MobivleNetV2|ResNet family on the ImageNet dataset. Intriguingly, thanks to its improved feature learning ability, ODConv with even one single kernel can compete with or outperform existing dynamic convolution counterparts with multiple kernels, substantially reducing extra parameters. Furthermore, ODConv is also superior to other attention modules for modulating the output features or the convolutional weights.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 148  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 2.

Vasconcelos*\n\n**TL;DR:** The key issue is that dynamic convolution applies dynamic attentions over channel groups after projecting into a higher dimensional intermediate space, and the proposed dynamic channel fusion enables significant dimension reduction of the intermediate space and mitigates the joint optimization difficulty.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent research in dynamic convolution shows substantial performance boost for efficient CNNs, due to the adaptive aggregation of K static convolution kernels.It has two limitations: (a) it increases the number of convolutional weights by K-times, and (b) the joint optimization of dynamic attention and static convolution kernels is challenging. In this paper, we revisit it from a new perspective of matrix decomposition and reveal the key issue is that dynamic convolution applies dynamic attentions over channel groups after projecting into a higher dimensional intermediate space. To address this issue, we propose dynamic channel fusion to replace dynamic attentions over channel groups. Dynamic channel fusion not only enables significant dimension reduction of the intermediate space, but also mitigates the joint optimization difficulty. As a result, our method is easier to train and requires significantly fewer parameters without sacrificing accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 55  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 3.

Inspired by a recently proposed model for general image classification, Recurrent Convolution Neural Network (RCNN), we propose a new architecture named Gated RCNN (GRCNN) for solving this problem. Its critical component, Gated Recurrent Convolution Layer (GRCL), is constructed by adding a gate to the Recurrent Convolution Layer (RCL), the critical component of RCNN. The gate controls the context modulation in RCL and balances the feed-forward information and the recurrent information. In addition, an efficient Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) is built for sequence modeling. The GRCNN is combined with BLSTM to recognize text in natural images. The entire GRCNN-BLSTM model can be trained end-to-end. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods on several benchmark datasets including the IIIT-5K, Street View Text (SVT) and ICDAR.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 156  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 4.

Lim, Jiwen Lu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Recursive Gated Convolution, a new operation that performs high-order spatial interactions with gated convolutions and recursive designs, is presented that can serve as a plug-and-play module to improve various vision Transformers and convolution-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent progress in vision Transformers exhibits great success in various tasks driven by the new spatial modeling mechanism based on dot-product self-attention. In this paper, we show that the key ingredients behind the vision Transformers, namely input-adaptive, long-range and high-order spatial interactions, can also be efficiently implemented with a convolution-based framework. We present the Recursive Gated Convolution ($\\textit{g}^\\textit{n}$Conv) that performs high-order spatial interactions with gated convolutions and recursive designs. The new operation is highly flexible and customizable, which is compatible with various variants of convolution and extends the two-order interactions in self-attention to arbitrary orders without introducing significant extra computation. $\\textit{g}^\\textit{n}$Conv can serve as a plug-and-play module to improve various vision Transformers and convolution-based models. Based on the operation, we construct a new family of generic vision backbones named HorNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet classification, COCO object detection and ADE20K semantic segmentation show HorNet outperform Swin Transformers and ConvNeXt by a significant margin with similar overall architecture and training configurations. HorNet also shows favorable scalability to more training data and larger model sizes. Apart from the effectiveness in visual encoders, we also show $\\textit{g}^\\textit{n}$Conv can be applied to task-specific decoders and consistently improve dense prediction performance with less computation. Our results demonstrate that $\\textit{g}^\\textit{n}$Conv can be a new basic module for visual modeling that effectively combines the merits of both vision Transformers and CNNs.

In this paper, we develop a methodology for finding semantically related questions. The task is difficult since 1) key pieces of information are often buried in extraneous details in the question body and 2) available annotations on similar questions are scarce and fragmented. We design a recurrent and convolutional model (gated convolution) to effectively map questions to their semantic representations. The models are pre-trained within an encoder-decoder framework (from body to title) on the basis of the entire raw corpus, and fine-tuned discriminatively from limited annotations. Our evaluation demonstrates that our model yields substantial gains over a standard IR baseline and various neural network architectures (including CNNs, LSTMs and GRUs).\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 105  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 6.

In this work we introduce a new learnable module, the Spatial Transformer, which explicitly allows the spatial manipulation of data within the network. This differentiable module can be inserted into existing convolutional architectures, giving neural networks the ability to actively spatially transform feature maps, conditional on the feature map itself, without any extra training supervision or modification to the optimisation process. We show that the use of spatial transformers results in models which learn invariance to translation, scale, rotation and more generic warping, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and for a number of classes of transformations.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 6961  (*Influential: 723*)\n\n#### 7.

However, many researchers wonder whether these models can maintain their dominance forever. Of course, we do not have answers now, but, as an attempt to find better neural architectures and training schemes, we pretrain a simple CNN using a GAN-style learning scheme and Wikipedia data, and then integrate it with standard TLMs. We show that on the GLUE tasks, the combination of our pretrained CNN with ALBERT outperforms the original ALBERT and achieves a similar performance to that of SOTA. Furthermore, on open-domain QA (Quasar-T and SearchQA), the combination of the CNN with ALBERT or RoBERTa achieved stronger performance than SOTA and the original TLMs. We hope that this work provides a hint for developing a novel strong network architecture along with its training scheme.

Geometry-Aware Supertagging with Heterogeneous Dynamic Convolutions\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Convolution*\n\n*Konstantinos Kogkalidis, Michael Moortgat*\n\n**Abstract:** The syntactic categories of categorial grammar formalisms are structured\nunits made of smaller, indivisible primitives, bound together by the underlying\ngrammar's category formation rules. In the trending approach of constructive\nsupertagging, neural models are increasingly made aware of the internal\ncategory structure, which in turn enables them to more reliably predict rare\nand out-of-vocabulary categories, with significant implications for grammars\npreviously deemed too complex to find practical use.

However, not much has been done on the front of investigating the\neffect of scaling properties of different inductive biases and model\narchitectures. Do model architectures scale differently? If so, how does\ninductive bias affect scaling behaviour? How does this influence upstream\n(pretraining) and downstream (transfer)? This paper conducts a systematic study\nof scaling behaviour of ten diverse model architectures such as Transformers,\nSwitch Transformers, Universal Transformers, Dynamic convolutions, Performers,\nand recently proposed MLP-Mixers. Via extensive experiments, we show that (1)\narchitecture is an indeed an important consideration when performing scaling\nand (2) the best performing model can fluctuate at different scales.

Zoology: Measuring and Improving Recall in Efficient Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Convolution*\n\n*Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Aman Timalsina, Isys Johnson, Michael Poli, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention-free language models that combine gating and convolutions are\ngrowing in popularity due to their efficiency and increasingly competitive\nperformance. To better understand these architectures, we pretrain a suite of\n17 attention and \"gated-convolution\" language models, finding that SoTA\ngated-convolution architectures still underperform attention by up to 2.1\nperplexity points on the Pile. In fine-grained analysis, we find 82% of the gap\nis explained by each model's ability to recall information that is previously\nmentioned in-context, e.g. \"Hakuna Matata means no worries Hakuna Matata it\nmeans no\" $\\rightarrow$ \"??\". On this task, termed \"associative recall\", we\nfind that attention outperforms gated-convolutions by a large margin: a 70M\nparameter attention model outperforms a 1.4 billion parameter gated-convolution\nmodel on associative recall. This is surprising because prior work shows gated\nconvolutions can perfectly solve synthetic tests for AR capability. To close\nthe gap between synthetics and real language, we develop a new formalization of\nthe task called multi-query associative recall (MQAR) that better reflects\nactual language. We perform an empirical and theoretical study of MQAR that\nelucidates differences in the parameter-efficiency of attention and\ngated-convolution recall. Informed by our analysis, we evaluate simple\nconvolution-attention hybrids and show that hybrids with input-dependent sparse\nattention patterns can close 97.4% of the gap to attention, while maintaining\nsub-quadratic scaling. Our code is accessible at:\nhttps://github.com/HazyResearch/zoology.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-08T09:44:25Z  (*Updated: 2023-12-08T09:44:25Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. An Attention-Gated Convolutional Neural Network for Sentence\n  Classification\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Convolution*\n\n*Yang Liu, Lixin Ji, Ruiyang Huang, Tuosiyu Ming, Chao Gao, Jianpeng Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** The classification of sentences is very challenging, since sentences contain\nthe limited contextual information. In this paper, we proposed an\nAttention-Gated Convolutional Neural Network (AGCNN) for sentence\nclassification, which generates attention weights from the feature's context\nwindows of different sizes by using specialized convolution encoders. It makes\nfull use of limited contextual information to extract and enhance the influence\nof important features in predicting the sentence's category. Experimental\nresults demonstrated that our model can achieve up to 3.1% higher accuracy than\nstandard CNN models, and gain competitive results over the baselines on four\nout of the six tasks. Besides, we designed an activation function, namely,\nNatural Logarithm rescaled Rectified Linear Unit (NLReLU). Experiments showed\nthat NLReLU can outperform ReLU and is comparable to other well-known\nactivation functions on AGCNN.\n\n**Published:** 2018-08-22T12:03:48Z  (*Updated: 2018-12-28T09:22:44Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Audiomer: A Convolutional Transformer For Keyword Spotting\n\n*From Search Query: Convolutional Transformer*\n\n*Surya Kant Sahu, Sai Mitheran, Juhi Kamdar, Meet Gandhi*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have seen an unprecedented rise in Natural Language Processing\nand Computer Vision tasks. However, in audio tasks, they are either infeasible\nto train due to extremely large sequence length of audio waveforms or incur a\nperformance penalty when trained on Fourier-based features. In this work, we\nintroduce an architecture, Audiomer, where we combine 1D Residual Networks with\nPerformer Attention to achieve state-of-the-art performance in keyword spotting\nwith raw audio waveforms, outperforming all previous methods while being\ncomputationally cheaper and parameter-efficient. Additionally, our model has\npractical advantages for speech processing, such as inference on arbitrarily\nlong audio clips owing to the absence of positional encoding. The code is\navailable at https://github.com/The-Learning-Machines/Audiomer-PyTorch.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-21T15:28:41Z  (*Updated: 2022-02-01T09:32:15Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6.

Zaigham Zaheer, Shah Nawaz, Karthik Nandakumar, Soo-Hyung Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Conversational engagement estimation is posed as a regression problem,\nentailing the identification of the favorable attention and involvement of the\nparticipants in the conversation. This task arises as a crucial pursuit to gain\ninsights into human's interaction dynamics and behavior patterns within a\nconversation. In this research, we introduce a dilated convolutional\nTransformer for modeling and estimating human engagement in the MULTIMEDIATE\n2023 competition. Our proposed system surpasses the baseline models, exhibiting\na noteworthy $7$\\% improvement on test set and $4$\\% on validation set.\nMoreover, we employ different modality fusion mechanism and show that for this\ntype of data, a simple concatenated method with self-attention fusion gains the\nbest performance.\n\n**Published:** 2023-07-31T06:02:35Z  (*Updated: 2023-07-31T06:02:35Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. ConvBERT: Improving BERT with Span-based Dynamic Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Convolution*\n\n*Zi-Hang Jiang, Yunpeng Chen, Weihao Yu, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan, Daquan Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models like BERT and its variants have recently achieved impressive performance in various natural language understanding tasks. However, BERT heavily relies on the global self-attention block and thus suffers large memory footprint and computation cost. Although all its attention heads query on the whole input sequence for generating the attention map from a global perspective, we observe some heads only need to learn local dependencies, which means the existence of computation redundancy. We therefore propose a novel span-based dynamic convolution to replace these self-attention heads to directly model local dependencies. The novel convolution heads, together with the rest self-attention heads, form a new mixed attention block that is more efficient at both global and local context learning. We equip BERT with this mixed attention design and build a ConvBERT model. Experiments have shown that ConvBERT significantly outperforms BERT and its variants in various downstream tasks, with lower training cost and fewer model parameters. Remarkably, ConvBERTbase model achieves 86.4 GLUE score, 0.7 higher than ELECTRAbase, while using less than 1/4 training cost. Code and pre-trained models will be released.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-08-06\n\n\n\n#### 2. Visual Dynamics: Probabilistic Future Frame Synthesis via Cross Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Convolution*\n\n*William T. Freeman, Katherine L. Bouman, Jiajun Wu, Tianfan Xue*\n\n**Abstract:** We study the problem of synthesizing a number of likely future frames from a\nsingle input image. In contrast to traditional methods, which have tackled this\nproblem in a deterministic or non-parametric way, we propose a novel approach\nthat models future frames in a probabilistic manner. Our probabilistic model\nmakes it possible for us to sample and synthesize many possible future frames\nfrom a single input image. Future frame synthesis is challenging, as it\ninvolves low- and high-level image and motion understanding. We propose a novel\nnetwork structure, namely a Cross Convolutional Network to aid in synthesizing\nfuture frames; this network structure encodes image and motion information as\nfeature maps and convolutional kernels, respectively. In experiments, our model\nperforms well on synthetic data, such as 2D shapes and animated game sprites,\nas well as on real-wold videos. We also show that our model can be applied to\ntasks such as visual analogy-making, and present an analysis of the learned\nnetwork representations.\n\n**Conference:** visual-dynamics-probabilistic-future-frame-1\n\n**Published:** 2016-07-09\n\n\n\n#### 3. Language Modeling with Gated Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Convolution*\n\n*Michael Auli, David Grangier, Angela Fan, Yann N. Dauphin*\n\n**Abstract:** The pre-dominant approach to language modeling to date is based on recurrent\nneural networks. Their success on this task is often linked to their ability to\ncapture unbounded context. In this paper we develop a finite context approach\nthrough stacked convolutions, which can be more efficient since they allow\nparallelization over sequential tokens. We propose a novel simplified gating\nmechanism that outperforms Oord et al (2016) and investigate the impact of key\narchitectural decisions. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art on the\nWikiText-103 benchmark, even though it features long-term dependencies, as well\nas competitive results on the Google Billion Words benchmark. Our model reduces\nthe latency to score a sentence by an order of magnitude compared to a\nrecurrent baseline. To our knowledge, this is the first time a non-recurrent\napproach is competitive with strong recurrent models on these large scale\nlanguage tasks.\n\n**Conference:** language-modeling-with-gated-convolutional-1\n\n**Published:** 2016-12-23\n\n\n\n#### 4. Free-Form Image Inpainting with Gated Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Convolution*\n\n*Xin Lu, Xiaohui Shen, Zhe Lin, Thomas Huang, Jimei Yang, Jiahui Yu*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a generative image inpainting system to complete images with free-form mask and guidance. The system is based on gated convolutions learned from millions of images without additional labelling efforts. The proposed gated convolution solves the issue of vanilla convolution that treats all input pixels as valid ones, generalizes partial convolution by providing a learnable dynamic feature selection mechanism for each channel at each spatial location across all layers. Moreover, as free-form masks may appear anywhere in images with any shape, global and local GANs designed for a single rectangular mask are not applicable. Thus, we also present a patch-based GAN loss, named SN-PatchGAN, by applying spectral-normalized discriminator on dense image patches. SN-PatchGAN is simple in formulation, fast and stable in training. Results on automatic image inpainting and user-guided extension demonstrate that our system generates higher-quality and more flexible results than previous methods. Our system helps user quickly remove distracting objects, modify image layouts, clear watermarks and edit faces.

CvT: Introducing Convolutions to Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Convolutional Transformer*\n\n*Lei Zhang, Lu Yuan, Xiyang Dai, Mengchen Liu, Noel Codella, Bin Xiao, Haiping Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** We present in this paper a new architecture, named Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT), that improves Vision Transformer (ViT) in performance and efficiency by introducing convolutions into ViT to yield the best of both designs. This is accomplished through two primary modifications: a hierarchy of Transformers containing a new convolutional token embedding, and a convolutional Transformer block leveraging a convolutional projection. These changes introduce desirable properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to the ViT architecture (\\ie shift, scale, and distortion invariance) while maintaining the merits of Transformers (\\ie dynamic attention, global context, and better generalization). We validate CvT by conducting extensive experiments, showing that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance over other Vision Transformers and ResNets on ImageNet-1k, with fewer parameters and lower FLOPs. In addition, performance gains are maintained when pretrained on larger datasets (\\eg ImageNet-22k) and fine-tuned to downstream tasks. Pre-trained on ImageNet-22k, our CvT-W24 obtains a top-1 accuracy of 87.7\\% on the ImageNet-1k val set. Finally, our results show that the positional encoding, a crucial component in existing Vision Transformers, can be safely removed in our model, simplifying the design for higher resolution vision tasks.

ViLT: Vision-and-Language Transformer Without Convolution or Region Supervision\n\n*From Search Query: Convolutional Transformer*\n\n*Ildoo Kim, Bokyung Son, Wonjae Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision-and-Language Pre-training (VLP) has improved performance on various joint vision-and-language downstream tasks. Current approaches to VLP heavily rely on image feature extraction processes, most of which involve region supervision (e.g., object detection) and the convolutional architecture (e.g., ResNet). Although disregarded in the literature, we find it problematic in terms of both (1) efficiency/speed, that simply extracting input features requires much more computation than the multimodal interaction steps; and (2) expressive power, as it is upper bounded to the expressive power of the visual embedder and its predefined visual vocabulary. In this paper, we present a minimal VLP model, Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT), monolithic in the sense that the processing of visual inputs is drastically simplified to just the same convolution-free manner that we process textual inputs. We show that ViLT is up to tens of times faster than previous VLP models, yet with competitive or better downstream task performance.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

We achieve this using properties of the proposed frequency domain transfer function parametrization, which enables direct computation of its corresponding convolutional kernel's spectrum via a single Fast Fourier Transform. Our experimental results across multiple sequence lengths and state sizes illustrates, on average, a 35% training speed improvement over S4 layers -- parametrized in time-domain -- on the Long Range Arena benchmark, while delivering state-of-the-art downstream performances over other attention-free approaches. Moreover, we report improved perplexity in language modeling over a long convolutional Hyena baseline, by simply introducing our transfer function parametrization.

Lightweight, Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks for AMR-to-Text Generation\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Convolution Language Models\"*\n\n*Yan Zhang, Zhijiang Guo, Zhiyang Teng, Wei Lu, Shay B. Cohen, Zuozhu Liu, Lidong Bing*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs and develops two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** AMR-to-text generation is used to transduce Abstract Meaning Representation structures (AMR) into text. A key challenge in this task is to efficiently learn effective graph representations. Previously, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) were used to encode input AMRs, however, vanilla GCNs are not able to capture non-local information and additionally, they follow a local (first-order) information aggregation scheme. To account for these issues, larger and deeper GCN models are required to capture more complex interactions. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic fusion mechanism, proposing Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs. We further develop two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity. With the help of these strategies, we are able to train a model with fewer parameters while maintaining the model capacity. Experiments demonstrate that LDGCNs outperform state-of-the-art models on two benchmark datasets for AMR-to-text generation with significantly fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. Scaling Vision-Language Models with Sparse Mixture of Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Convolution Language Models\"*\n\n*Sheng Shen, Z. Yao, Chunyuan Li, Trevor Darrell, K. Keutzer, Yuxiong He*\n\n**TL;DR:** The effectiveness of MoE in scaling vision-language models is explored, demonstrating its potential to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks over dense models of equivalent computational cost.\n\n**Abstract:** The field of natural language processing (NLP) has made significant strides in recent years, particularly in the development of large-scale vision-language models (VLMs). These models aim to bridge the gap between text and visual information, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of multimedia data. However, as these models become larger and more complex, they also become more challenging to train and deploy. One approach to addressing this challenge is the use of sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) techniques, which divide the model into smaller, specialized sub-models that can jointly solve a task. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of MoE in scaling vision-language models, demonstrating its potential to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks over dense models of equivalent computational cost. Our research offers valuable insights into stabilizing the training of MoE models, understanding the impact of MoE on model interpretability, and balancing the trade-offs between compute performance when scaling VLMs. We hope our work will inspire further research into the use of MoE for scaling large-scale vision-language models and other multimodal machine learning applications.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 43  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3.

We redefine the task as text promptable, thereby enabling a more nuanced comprehension of surgical instruments and adaptability to new instrument types. Inspired by recent advancements in vision-language models, we leverage pretrained image and text encoders as our model backbone and design a text promptable mask decoder consisting of attention- and convolution-based prompting schemes for surgical instrument segmentation prediction. Our model leverages multiple text prompts for each surgical instrument through a new mixture of prompts mechanism, resulting in enhanced segmentation performance. Additionally, we introduce a hard instrument area reinforcement module to improve image feature comprehension and segmentation precision. Extensive experiments on several surgical instrument segmentation datasets demonstrate our model's superior performance and promising generalization capability. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a promptable approach to surgical instrument segmentation, offering significant potential for practical application in the field of robotic-assisted surgery.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

Current approaches to VLP heavily rely on image feature extraction processes, most of which involve region supervision (e.g., object detection) and the convolutional architecture (e.g., ResNet). Although disregarded in the literature, we find it problematic in terms of both (1) efficiency/speed, that simply extracting input features requires much more computation than the multimodal interaction steps; and (2) expressive power, as it is upper bounded to the expressive power of the visual embedder and its predefined visual vocabulary. In this paper, we present a minimal VLP model, Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT), monolithic in the sense that the processing of visual inputs is drastically simplified to just the same convolution-free manner that we process textual inputs. We show that ViLT is up to tens of times faster than previous VLP models, yet with competitive or better downstream task performance.

Geometry-Aware Supertagging with Heterogeneous Dynamic Convolutions\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Convolution Language Models\"*\n\n*Konstantinos Kogkalidis, Michael Moortgat*\n\n**Abstract:** The syntactic categories of categorial grammar formalisms are structured\nunits made of smaller, indivisible primitives, bound together by the underlying\ngrammar's category formation rules. In the trending approach of constructive\nsupertagging, neural models are increasingly made aware of the internal\ncategory structure, which in turn enables them to more reliably predict rare\nand out-of-vocabulary categories, with significant implications for grammars\npreviously deemed too complex to find practical use. In this work, we revisit\nconstructive supertagging from a graph-theoretic perspective, and propose a\nframework based on heterogeneous dynamic graph convolutions aimed at exploiting\nthe distinctive structure of a supertagger's output space.

LoCoCo: Dropping In Convolutions for Long Context Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Convolution Language Models\"*\n\n*Ruisi Cai, Yuandong Tian, Zhangyang Wang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper tackles the memory hurdle of processing long context sequences in\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), by presenting a novel approach, Dropping In\nConvolutions for Long Context Compression (LoCoCo). LoCoCo employs only a\nfixed-size Key-Value (KV) cache, and can enhance efficiency in both inference\nand fine-tuning stages. Diverging from prior methods that selectively drop KV\npairs based on heuristics, LoCoCo leverages a data-driven adaptive fusion\ntechnique, blending previous KV pairs with incoming tokens to minimize the loss\nof contextual information and ensure accurate attention modeling. This token\nintegration is achieved through injecting one-dimensional convolutional kernels\nthat dynamically calculate mixing weights for each KV cache slot. Designed for\nbroad compatibility with existing LLM frameworks, LoCoCo allows for\nstraightforward \"drop-in\" integration without needing architectural\nmodifications, while incurring minimal tuning overhead. Experiments demonstrate\nthat LoCoCo maintains consistently outstanding performance across various\ncontext lengths and can achieve a high context compression rate during both\ninference and fine-tuning phases. During inference, we successfully compressed\nup to 3482 tokens into a 128-size KV cache, while retaining comparable\nperformance to the full sequence - an accuracy improvement of up to 0.2791\ncompared to baselines at the same cache size. During post-training tuning, we\nalso effectively extended the context length from 4K to 32K using a KV cache of\nfixed size 512, achieving performance similar to fine-tuning with entire\nsequences.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-08T01:35:11Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-08T01:35:11Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Zoology: Measuring and Improving Recall in Efficient Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Convolution Language Models\"*\n\n*Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Aman Timalsina, Isys Johnson, Michael Poli, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention-free language models that combine gating and convolutions are\ngrowing in popularity due to their efficiency and increasingly competitive\nperformance. To better understand these architectures, we pretrain a suite of\n17 attention and \"gated-convolution\" language models, finding that SoTA\ngated-convolution architectures still underperform attention by up to 2.1\nperplexity points on the Pile. In fine-grained analysis, we find 82% of the gap\nis explained by each model's ability to recall information that is previously\nmentioned in-context, e.g. \"Hakuna Matata means no worries Hakuna Matata it\nmeans no\" $\\rightarrow$ \"??\". On this task, termed \"associative recall\", we\nfind that attention outperforms gated-convolutions by a large margin: a 70M\nparameter attention model outperforms a 1.4 billion parameter gated-convolution\nmodel on associative recall. This is surprising because prior work shows gated\nconvolutions can perfectly solve synthetic tests for AR capability. To close\nthe gap between synthetics and real language, we develop a new formalization of\nthe task called multi-query associative recall (MQAR) that better reflects\nactual language. We perform an empirical and theoretical study of MQAR that\nelucidates differences in the parameter-efficiency of attention and\ngated-convolution recall. Informed by our analysis, we evaluate simple\nconvolution-attention hybrids and show that hybrids with input-dependent sparse\nattention patterns can close 97.4% of the gap to attention, while maintaining\nsub-quadratic scaling.

MosaicBERT: A Bidirectional Encoder Optimized for Fast Pretraining\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic and Gated Convolutions NLP\"*\n\n*Jacob Portes, Alex Trott, Sam Havens, Daniel King, Abhinav Venigalla, Moin Nadeem, Nikhil Sardana, Daya Khudia, Jonathan Frankle*\n\n**Abstract:** Although BERT-style encoder models are heavily used in NLP research, many\nresearchers do not pretrain their own BERTs from scratch due to the high cost\nof training. In the past half-decade since BERT first rose to prominence, many\nadvances have been made with other transformer architectures and training\nconfigurations that have yet to be systematically incorporated into BERT. Here,\nwe introduce MosaicBERT, a BERT-style encoder architecture and training recipe\nthat is empirically optimized for fast pretraining. This efficient architecture\nincorporates FlashAttention, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi), Gated Linear\nUnits (GLU), a module to dynamically remove padded tokens, and low precision\nLayerNorm into the classic transformer encoder block. The training recipe\nincludes a 30% masking ratio for the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objective,\nbfloat16 precision, and vocabulary size optimized for GPU throughput, in\naddition to best-practices from RoBERTa and other encoder models. When\npretrained from scratch on the C4 dataset, this base model achieves a\ndownstream average GLUE (dev) score of 79.6 in 1.13 hours on 8 A100 80 GB GPUs\nat a cost of roughly $20. We plot extensive accuracy vs. pretraining speed\nPareto curves and show that MosaicBERT base and large are consistently Pareto\noptimal when compared to a competitive BERT base and large.

ConvBERT: Improving BERT with Span-based Dynamic Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Convolution Language Models\"*\n\n*Zi-Hang Jiang, Yunpeng Chen, Weihao Yu, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan, Daquan Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models like BERT and its variants have recently achieved impressive performance in various natural language understanding tasks. However, BERT heavily relies on the global self-attention block and thus suffers large memory footprint and computation cost. Although all its attention heads query on the whole input sequence for generating the attention map from a global perspective, we observe some heads only need to learn local dependencies, which means the existence of computation redundancy. We therefore propose a novel span-based dynamic convolution to replace these self-attention heads to directly model local dependencies. The novel convolution heads, together with the rest self-attention heads, form a new mixed attention block that is more efficient at both global and local context learning. We equip BERT with this mixed attention design and build a ConvBERT model. Experiments have shown that ConvBERT significantly outperforms BERT and its variants in various downstream tasks, with lower training cost and fewer model parameters. Remarkably, ConvBERTbase model achieves 86.4 GLUE score, 0.7 higher than ELECTRAbase, while using less than 1/4 training cost.

Pay Less Attention with Lightweight and Dynamic Convolutions\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Convolution Language Models\"*\n\n*Michael Auli, Angela Fan, Yann N. Dauphin, Felix Wu, Alexei Baevski*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention is a useful mechanism to build generative models for language\nand images. It determines the importance of context elements by comparing each\nelement to the current time step. In this paper, we show that a very\nlightweight convolution can perform competitively to the best reported\nself-attention results. Next, we introduce dynamic convolutions which are\nsimpler and more efficient than self-attention. We predict separate convolution\nkernels based solely on the current time-step in order to determine the\nimportance of context elements. The number of operations required by this\napproach scales linearly in the input length, whereas self-attention is\nquadratic. Experiments on large-scale machine translation, language modeling\nand abstractive summarization show that dynamic convolutions improve over\nstrong self-attention models. On the WMT'14 English-German test set dynamic\nconvolutions achieve a new state of the art of 29.7 BLEU.\n\n**Conference:** pay-less-attention-with-lightweight-and-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-29\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Their success on this task is often linked to their ability to\ncapture unbounded context. In this paper we develop a finite context approach\nthrough stacked convolutions, which can be more efficient since they allow\nparallelization over sequential tokens. We propose a novel simplified gating\nmechanism that outperforms Oord et al (2016) and investigate the impact of key\narchitectural decisions.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Convolution Language Models\"*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher integrate dynamic and gated convolutions into language models, focusing on implementation strategies, practical challenges, and potential trade-offs, here are the most relevant and useful pieces of information from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n### Dynamic Convolution\n\n1. **Adaptability and Efficiency**:\n   - Dynamic convolution allows the model to adapt the convolutional kernel based on the input, enhancing its ability to capture local patterns and dependencies. Studies like Wu et al. (2019) and Zhou et al. (2020) show that dynamic convolution can be more efficient and faster than traditional self-attention mechanisms while maintaining or improving performance.\n\n2. **Implementation Strategies**:\n   - **Kernel Generation**: Dynamic kernels can be generated using lightweight networks that compute attention scores or weights conditioned on the input. For example, Wu et al. (2019) propose using a shallow network to compute these weights.\n   - **Matrix Decomposition**: Li et al. (2021) suggest using matrix decomposition techniques to simplify dynamic convolution, reducing the number of parameters and making it easier to train.\n\n3. **Practical Challenges**:\n   - **Complexity**: While dynamic convolution adds adaptability, it may introduce additional computational overhead if not implemented efficiently. Careful design and optimization are necessary to mitigate this.\n   - **Training Stability**: Ensuring stable training may require careful initialization and regularization techniques to avoid issues like exploding gradients or vanishing gradients.\n\n### Gated Convolution\n\n1. **Information Flow Control**:\n   - Gated convolutions introduce mechanisms like Gated Linear Units (GLUs) to control the flow of information through the network, enhancing representational capacity. Dauphin et al. (2017) demonstrate that gated convolutions can outperform traditional activation functions and recurrent models in language modeling tasks.\n\n2. **Implementation Strategies**:\n   - **GLU Mechanisms**: Implement gating mechanisms within the convolutional layers to modulate the output dynamically based on the input. This can be done by using GLUs which allow the model to control the information flow.\n   - **Compatibility with Existing Architectures**: Gated convolutions can be integrated into existing convolutional layers with minimal structural changes, making them a viable option for enhancing current models.\n\n3. **Practical Challenges**:\n   - **Parameter Efficiency**: Balancing the number of parameters to maintain computational efficiency while achieving performance gains is crucial. Gated convolutions can add complexity, so careful parameter tuning is necessary.\n   - **Capturing Long-Range Dependencies**: Arora et al. (2023) suggest that gated convolutions may underperform in tasks requiring long-range dependency modeling compared to attention mechanisms. Hybrid models might be necessary to address this limitation.\n\n### Hybrid Approaches\n\n1. **Combining Convolution and Attention**:\n   - Hybrid models that combine convolutional mechanisms with sparse attention can close performance gaps while maintaining efficiency.

[^0]\n## 1 Introduction\n\nHandling Long-Range Dependency (LRD) is a key challenge in long-sequence modeling tasks such as time-series forecasting, language modeling, and pixel-level image generation. Unfortunately, standard deep learning models fail to solve this problem for different reasons: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) suffers from vanishing gradient, Transformer has complexity quadratic in the sequence length, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) usually only has a local receptive field in each layer. A recently proposed benchmark called Long-Range Arena (LRA) Tay et al. 2020b reveals that all existing models perform poorly in modeling LRD. Notably, on one spatial-level sequence modeling task called Pathfinder-X from LRA, all models fail except a new Structured State Space sequence model (S4) Gu et al. 2021a. The S4 model is inspired by the state space model widely used in control theory and can be computed efficiently with a special parameterization based on the Cauchy kernel. The exact implementation of the S4 model can be viewed as a (depthwise) global convolutional model with an involved computation global convolution kernel. Thanks to the global receptive field of the convolution kernel, S4 is able to handle tasks that require LRD, such as Pathfinder Tay et al., 2020b, where classic local CNNs fail Linsley et al., 2018, Kim et al., 2019]. Also, the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and techniques from numerical linear algebra make the computational complexity of S 4 tractable compared to the quadratic complexity of attention. Together, S4 shows the potential of global convolutional models to model LRD and advances the SoTA on LRA. Despite its accomplishments, the delicate design of S4 makes it unfriendly even to knowledgable researchers. In particular, the empirical success of S4 relies on 1) A Diagonal Plus Low Rank (DLPR) parameterization whose efficient implementation requires several numerical linear algebra tricks, 2) An initialization scheme based on the HiPPO matrix derived in prior work Gu et al., 2020. Therefore, aiming to reduce the complications of the model and highlight minimal principles, we raise the following questions:\n\nWhat contributes to the success of the S4 model? Can we establish a simpler model based on minimal principles to handle long-range dependency? To answer these questions, we focus on the design of the global convolution kernel. We extract two simple and intuitive principles that contribute to the success of the S4 kernel. The first principle is that the parameterization of the global convolution kernel should be efficient in terms of the sequence length: the number of parameters should scale slowly with the sequence length. For example, classic CNNs use a fixed kernel size. S4 also uses a fixed number of parameters to compute the convolution kernel while the number is greater than classic CNNs. Both models satisfy the first principle as the number of parameters does not scale with input length. The efficiency of parameterization is also necessary because the naive implementation of a global convolution kernel with the size of sentence length is intractable for inputs with thousands of tokens. Too many parameters will also cause overfitting, thus hurting the performance. The second principle is the decaying structure of the convolution kernel, meaning that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. This structure appears ubiquitously in signal processing, with the well-known Gaussian filter as an example. The intuition is clear that closer neighbors provide a more helpful signal. S4 inherently enjoys\nthis decaying property because of the exponential decay of the spectrum of matrix powers (See Figure 22), and we find this inductive bias improves the model performance (See Section 4.1.2). We show that these two principles are sufficient for designing a global convolutional model that captures LRD well. To verify this, we introduce a class of global convolution kernels with a simple multiscale structure, as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, we compose the convolution kernel by a sequence of subkernels of increasing sizes, yet every subkernel is upsampled from the same number of parameters. This parameterization ensures that the number of parameters only scales logarithmically to the input length, which satisfies the first principle. In addition, we add a decaying weight to each scale during the combination step and fulfill the second principle. We named our methods as Structural Global Convolution kernels (SGConv). Empirically, SGConv improves S4 by more than $1 \\%$ and achieves SoTA results on the LRA benchmark. On Speech Command datasets, SGConv achieves comparative results in the ten-class classification task and significantly better results in the\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_de99aaee211b08088edeg-03.jpg?height=589&width=749&top_left_y=454&top_left_x=1038)\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the parameterization used in SGConv (Eq.\n```\n\n#### 3. Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Franz A. Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Here are the key points and the most useful information to help achieve this goal:\n\n### Integration of Dynamic Convolutions\n\n- **Adaptability and Efficiency**:\n  - Dynamic convolutions allow the model to adapt convolutional kernels based on the input, enhancing the capture of local patterns and varying contexts. This is well-demonstrated in works like **ConvBERT** by Zhou et al. (2020), where dynamic convolution significantly outperforms BERT and its variants in various downstream tasks.\n\n- **Implementation Strategies**:\n  - Use lightweight networks to generate dynamic kernels conditioned on the input, as seen in Wu et al. (2019) and ConvBERT. This approach ensures efficiency without a significant increase in computational complexity.\n  - Apply matrix decomposition techniques to simplify dynamic convolutions and reduce the parameter count, improving training efficiency.\n\n- **Practical Challenges**:\n  - Optimize kernel generation functions to minimize additional computational costs.\n  - Ensure proper initialization, regularization, and learning rate schedules to maintain training stability.\n\n### Integration of Gated Convolutions\n\n- **Control of Information Flow**:\n  - Gated convolutions, such as Gated Linear Units (GLUs), modulate the flow of information based on the input, enhancing representational capacity. This is detailed in Dauphin et al. (2017), where gated convolutional networks outperform recurrent models like LSTMs.\n\n- **Implementation Strategies**:\n  - Incorporate GLUs within convolutional layers to control activation outputs. This can be done with minimal changes to the existing architecture, as shown in the work on gated convolutional networks.\n  - Hybrid models like Griffin, which mix gated linear recurrences with local attention, can provide insights into efficient integration.\n\n- **Practical Challenges**:\n  - Ensure efficient design to avoid excessive parameter growth, which could impact training and inference efficiency.\n  - Recognize that gated convolutions may be less effective in capturing long-range dependencies compared to attention mechanisms, as noted by Arora et al. (2023).\n\n### Potential Hybrid Approaches\n\n- **Combining Convolution and Attention**:\n  - Hybrid models can capture both local and global dependencies effectively. For example, Griffin combines gated linear recurrences with local attention, achieving hardware efficiency and high throughput.\n  - Employ sparse attention patterns to reduce computational costs while benefiting from attention's ability to model long-range dependencies.\n\n- **Implementation Considerations**:\n  - Careful architectural design is necessary to maintain efficiency in hybrid models.\n  - Strategies to ensure stable and efficient training are crucial when combining different mechanisms.\n\n### Open-Source Implementations and Resources\n\n- **ConvBERT**: Provides code and pre-trained models demonstrating the integration of dynamic convolution into transformers, which can be a valuable resource for practical implementation.\n- **MosaicBERT**: Offers insights into the use of GLUs and other efficient components, with open-sourced code available for reference.\n\n### Future Research Directions\n\n- **Investigate Recent Hybrid Models**:\n  - Focus on recent literature (post-2022) on language models that integrate convolutional mechanisms with attention. This includes works like LoCoCo, which employs adaptive fusion techniques for context compression, and MosaicBERT, which optimizes pretraining efficiency.\n\n- **Explore Implementation Strategies and Optimization Techniques**:\n  - Detailed implementation strategies, such as kernel generation and matrix decomposition, are crucial. Also, explore best practices and optimization techniques to ensure efficient integration.\n\n- **Assess Impact on Long-Range Dependencies**:\n  - Research methods to enhance the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies, possibly through hybrid approaches or novel architectural modifications. This could involve combining convolutional mechanisms with attention layers or other long-range dependency modeling techniques.\n\n- **Hardware Optimization**:\n  - Investigate hardware-aware optimizations for convolutional mechanisms, such as utilizing GPU accelerations and memory-efficient implementations to maximize performance benefits.\n\n### Key References\n\n- **Dauphin, Y.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

On the WMT' 14 English-German test set dynamic convolutions achieve a new state of the art of 29.7 BLEU ${ }^{1}$\n\n\n## 1 INTRODUCTION\n\nThere has been much recent progress in sequence modeling through recurrent neural networks (RNN; Sutskever et al. 2014, Bahdanau et al. 2015, Wu et al. 2016), convolutional networks (CNN; Kalchbrenner et al. 2016; Gehring et al. 2016; 2017; Kaiser et al. 2017) and self-attention models (Paulus et al.||2017; Vaswani et al.||2017). RNNs integrate context information by updating a hidden state at every time-step, CNNs summarize a fixed size context through multiple layers, while as self-attention directly summarizes all context. Attention assigns context elements attention weights which define a weighted sum over context representations (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Chorowski et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Source-target attention summarizes information from another sequence such as in machine translation while as self-attention operates over the current sequence. Self-attention has been formulated as content-based where attention weights are computed by comparing the current time-step to all elements in the context (Figure 1a). The ability to compute comparisons over such unrestricted context sizes are seen as a key characteristic of self-attention (Vaswani et al., 2017). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5c8e090190e689be38d0g-01.jpg?height=267&width=1369&top_left_y=1886&top_left_x=380)\n\nFigure 1: Self-attention computes attention weights by comparing all pairs of elements to each other (a) while as dynamic convolutions predict separate kernels for each time-step (b). However, the ability of self-attention to model long-range dependencies has recently come into question (Tang et al., 2018) and the unlimited context size is computationally very challenging due to the quadratic complexity in the input length. Furthermore, in practice long sequences require the introduction of hierarchies (Liu et al., 2018). [^0]In this paper, we introduce lightweight convolutions which are depth-wise separable (Sifre, 2014 , Chollet, 2017; Kaiser et al, 2017), softmax-normalized and share weights over the channel dimension. The result is a convolution with several orders of magnitude fewer weights than a standard nonseparable convolution. Different to self-attention, lightweight convolutions reuse the same weights for context elements, regardless of the current time-step. Dynamic convolutions build on lightweight convolutions by predicting a different convolution kernel at every time-step. The kernel is a function of the current time-step only as opposed to the entire context as in self-attention (Figure 1b). Dynamic convolutions are similar to locally connected layers in the sense that the weights change at every position, however, the difference is that weights are dynamically generated by the model rather than fixed after training (LeCun et al., 1998; Taigman et al.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Current innovations, including State Space Models, were initially celebrated for surpassing Transformer performance on language modeling tasks. However, these models have revealed deficiencies in essential In-Context Learning capabilities - a domain where the Transformer traditionally shines. The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field. In our work, we present a singular, elegant alteration to the Based kernel that amplifies its In-Context Learning abilities evaluated with the Multi-Query Associative Recall task and overall language modeling process, as demonstrated on the Pile dataset.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/25 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\nSmith, and Lingpeng Kong. 2021.

In this work, we show that while Transformers tend to have larger model capacity, their generalization can be worse than convolutional networks due to the lack of the right inductive bias. To effectively combine the strengths from both architectures, we present CoAtNets(pronounced\"coat\"nets), a family of hybrid models built from two key insights: (1) depthwise Convolution and self-Attention can be naturally unified via simple relative attention; (2) vertically stacking convolution layers and attention layers in a principled way is surprisingly effective in improving generalization, capacity and efficiency. Experiments show that our CoAtNets achieve state-of-the-art performance under different resource constraints across various datasets: Without extra data, CoAtNet achieves 86.0% ImageNet top-1 accuracy; When pre-trained with 13M images from ImageNet-21K, our CoAtNet achieves 88.56% top-1 accuracy, matching ViT-huge pre-trained with 300M images from JFT-300M while using 23x less data; Notably, when we further scale up CoAtNet with JFT-3B, it achieves 90.88% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, establishing a new state-of-the-art result.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 994  (*Influential: 105*)\n\n#### 2. HGCN4MeSH: Hybrid Graph Convolution Network for MeSH Indexing\n\n*From Search Query: Hybrid Convolution Attention Models*\n\n*Miaomiao Yu, Yujiu Yang, Chenhui Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Hybrid Graph Convolution Net for MeSH index (HGCN4MeSH) is presented, which establishes the adjacency matrix of MeSH terms based on the co-occurrence relationships in Corpus, which is easy to apply for GCN representation learning.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently deep learning has been used in Medical subject headings (MeSH) indexing to reduce the time and monetary cost by manual annotation, including DeepMeSH, TextCNN, etc. However, these models still suffer from failing to capture the complex correlations between MeSH terms. To this end, we introduce Graph Convolution Network (GCN) to learn the relationship between these terms, and present a novel Hybrid Graph Convolution Net for MeSH index (HGCN4MeSH). Basically, we utilize two BiGRUs to learn the embedding representation of the abstract and the title of the MeSH index text respectively. At the same time, we establish the adjacency matrix of MeSH terms based on the co-occurrence relationships in Corpus, which is easy to apply for GCN representation learning. On the basis of learning the mixed representation, the prediction problem of the MeSH index keywords is transformed into an extreme multi-label classification problem after the attention layer operation. Experimental results on two datasets show that HGCN4MeSH is competitive compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Semantic-Unit-Based Dilated Convolution for Multi-Label Text Classification\n\n*From Search Query: Hybrid Convolution Attention Models*\n\n*Junyang Lin, Qi Su, Pengcheng Yang, Shuming Ma, Xu Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel model for multi-label text classification that generates higher-level semantic unit representations with multi-level dilated convolution as well as a corresponding hybrid attention mechanism that extracts both the information at the word-level and the level of the semantic unit.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel model for multi-label text classification, which is based on sequence-to-sequence learning. The model generates higher-level semantic unit representations with multi-level dilated convolution as well as a corresponding hybrid attention mechanism that extracts both the information at the word-level and the level of the semantic unit. Our designed dilated convolution effectively reduces dimension and supports an exponential expansion of receptive fields without loss of local information, and the attention-over-attention mechanism is able to capture more summary relevant information from the source context. Results of our experiments show that the proposed model has significant advantages over the baseline models on the dataset RCV1-V2 and Ren-CECps, and our analysis demonstrates that our model is competitive to the deterministic hierarchical models and it is more robust to classifying low-frequency labels\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 57  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4. Segment-Level Sequence Modeling using Gated Recursive Semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Convolutional Language Models*\n\n*Jingwei Zhuo, Yong Cao, Jun Zhu, Bo Zhang, Zaiqing Nie*\n\n**TL;DR:** Gated Recursive Semi- CRFs (grSemi-CRFs), which model segments directly and automatically learn segmentlevel features through a gated recursive convolutional neural network, and generally outperform other neural models.\n\n**Abstract:** Most of the sequence tagging tasks in natural language processing require to recognize segments with certain syntactic role or semantic meaning in a sentence. They are usually tackled with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), which do indirect word-level modeling over word-level features and thus cannot make full use of segment-level information. Semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields (Semi-CRFs) model segments directly but extracting segment-level features for Semi-CRFs is still a very challenging problem. This paper presents Gated Recursive Semi-CRFs (grSemi-CRFs), which model segments directly and automatically learn segmentlevel features through a gated recursive convolutional neural network. Our experiments on text chunking and named entity recognition (NER) demonstrate that grSemi-CRFs generally outperform other neural models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 5.

Bhattacharyya*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel method for combining deep learning and classical feature based models using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network for financial sentiment analysis using a classical supervised model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR).\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a novel method for combining deep learning and classical feature based models using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network for financial sentiment analysis. We develop various deep learning models based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). These are trained on top of pre-trained, autoencoder-based, financial word embeddings and lexicon features. An ensemble is constructed by combining these deep learning models and a classical supervised model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR). We evaluate our proposed technique on a benchmark dataset of SemEval-2017 shared task on financial sentiment analysis. The propose model shows impressive results on two datasets, i.e. microblogs and news headlines datasets. Comparisons show that our proposed model performs better than the existing state-of-the-art systems for the above two datasets by 2.0 and 4.1 cosine points, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 83  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 6. Bi-Directional Block Self-Attention for Fast and Memory-Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Long-Range Dependency Modeling*\n\n*Tao Shen, Tianyi Zhou, Guodong Long, Jing Jiang, Chengqi Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a model, called \"bi-directional block self-attention network (Bi-BloSAN), for RNN/CNN-free sequence encoding that achieves or improves upon state-of-the-art accuracy, and shows better efficiency-memory trade-off than existing RNN /CNN/SAN.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN) and self-attention networks (SAN) are commonly used to produce context-aware representations. RNN can capture long-range dependency but is hard to parallelize and not time-efficient. CNN focuses on local dependency but does not perform well on some tasks. SAN can model both such dependencies via highly parallelizable computation, but memory requirement grows rapidly in line with sequence length. In this paper, we propose a model, called \"bi-directional block self-attention network (Bi-BloSAN)\", for RNN/CNN-free sequence encoding. It requires as little memory as RNN but with all the merits of SAN. Bi-BloSAN splits the entire sequence into blocks, and applies an intra-block SAN to each block for modeling local context, then applies an inter-block SAN to the outputs for all blocks to capture long-range dependency. Thus, each SAN only needs to process a short sequence, and only a small amount of memory is required. Additionally, we use feature-level attention to handle the variation of contexts around the same word, and use forward/backward masks to encode temporal order information. On nine benchmark datasets for different NLP tasks, Bi-BloSAN achieves or improves upon state-of-the-art accuracy, and shows better efficiency-memory trade-off than existing RNN/CNN/SAN.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 144  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 7. Tensorized Self-Attention: Efficiently Modeling Pairwise and Global Dependencies Together\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Long-Range Dependency Modeling*\n\n*Tao Shen, Tianyi Zhou, Guodong Long, Jing Jiang, Chengqi Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel attention mechanism called \u201cMulti-mask Tensorized Self-Attention\u201d (MTSA), which is as fast and as memory-efficient as a CNN, but significantly outperforms previous CNN-/RNN-/attention-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks equipped with self-attention have parallelizable computation, light-weight structure, and the ability to capture both long-range and local dependencies. Further, their expressive power and performance can be boosted by using a vector to measure pairwise dependency, but this requires to expand the alignment matrix to a tensor, which results in memory and computation bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism called \u201cMulti-mask Tensorized Self-Attention\u201d (MTSA), which is as fast and as memory-efficient as a CNN, but significantly outperforms previous CNN-/RNN-/attention-based models. MTSA 1) captures both pairwise (token2token) and global (source2token) dependencies by a novel compatibility function composed of dot-product and additive attentions, 2) uses a tensor to represent the feature-wise alignment scores for better expressive power but only requires parallelizable matrix multiplications, and 3) combines multi-head with multi-dimensional attentions, and applies a distinct positional mask to each head (subspace), so the memory and computation can be distributed to multiple heads, each with sequential information encoded independently. The experiments show that a CNN/RNN-free model based on MTSA achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on nine NLP benchmarks with compelling memory- and time-efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Long-Range Dependency Modeling*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value and the lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have surpassed RNNs in popularity due to their superior abilities in parallel training and long-term dependency modeling. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

Zoology: Measuring and Improving Recall in Efficient Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Convolutional Language Models*\n\n*Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Aman Timalsina, Isys Johnson, Michael Poli, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention-free language models that combine gating and convolutions are\ngrowing in popularity due to their efficiency and increasingly competitive\nperformance. To better understand these architectures, we pretrain a suite of\n17 attention and \"gated-convolution\" language models, finding that SoTA\ngated-convolution architectures still underperform attention by up to 2.1\nperplexity points on the Pile. In fine-grained analysis, we find 82% of the gap\nis explained by each model's ability to recall information that is previously\nmentioned in-context, e.g. \"Hakuna Matata means no worries Hakuna Matata it\nmeans no\" $\\rightarrow$ \"??\". On this task, termed \"associative recall\", we\nfind that attention outperforms gated-convolutions by a large margin: a 70M\nparameter attention model outperforms a 1.4 billion parameter gated-convolution\nmodel on associative recall. This is surprising because prior work shows gated\nconvolutions can perfectly solve synthetic tests for AR capability. To close\nthe gap between synthetics and real language, we develop a new formalization of\nthe task called multi-query associative recall (MQAR) that better reflects\nactual language. We perform an empirical and theoretical study of MQAR that\nelucidates differences in the parameter-efficiency of attention and\ngated-convolution recall. Informed by our analysis, we evaluate simple\nconvolution-attention hybrids and show that hybrids with input-dependent sparse\nattention patterns can close 97.4% of the gap to attention, while maintaining\nsub-quadratic scaling.

DEEPCHORUS: A Hybrid Model of Multi-scale Convolution and Self-attention for Chorus Detection\n\n*From Search Query: Hybrid Convolution Attention Models*\n\n*Wei Li, Yi Yu, Xiaoheng Sun, Qiqi He*\n\n**Abstract:** Chorus detection is a challenging problem in musical signal processing as the chorus often repeats more than once in popular songs, usually with rich instruments and complex rhythm forms. Most of the existing works focus on the receptiveness of chorus sections based on some explicit features such as loudness and occurrence frequency. These pre-assumptions for chorus limit the generalization capacity of these methods, causing misdetection on other repeated sections such as verse. To solve the problem, in this paper we propose an end-to-end chorus detection model DeepChorus, reducing the engineering effort and the need for prior knowledge. The proposed model includes two main structures: i) a Multi-Scale Network to derive preliminary representations of chorus segments, and ii) a Self-Attention Convolution Network to further process the features into probability curves representing chorus presence. To obtain the final results, we apply an adaptive threshold to binarize the original curve. The experimental results show that DeepChorus outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in most cases.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-13\n\n\n\n#### 2. A Transformer with Interleaved Self-attention and Convolution for Hybrid Acoustic Models\n\n*From Search Query: Hybrid Convolution Attention Models*\n\n*Liang Lu*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer with self-attention has achieved great success in the area of nature language processing. Recently, there have been a few studies on transformer for end-to-end speech recognition, while its application for hybrid acoustic model is still very limited. In this paper, we revisit the transformer-based hybrid acoustic model, and propose a model structure with interleaved self-attention and 1D convolution, which is proven to have faster convergence and higher recognition accuracy. We also study several aspects of the transformer model, including the impact of the positional encoding feature, dropout regularization, as well as training with and without time restriction. We show competitive recognition results on the public Librispeech dataset when compared to the Kaldi baseline at both cross entropy training and sequence training stages.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Convolutional Language Models*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 5. Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Long-Range Dependency Modeling*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Jonathan May, Graham Neubig, Liangke Gui, Junxian He, Xiang Kong, Chunting Zhou, Xuezhe Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** The design choices in the Transformer attention mechanism, including weak inductive bias and quadratic computational complexity, have limited its application for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 6. Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Long-Range Dependency Modeling*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are quickly becoming one of the most heavily applied deep learning architectures across modalities, domains, and tasks. In vision, on top of ongoing efforts into plain transformers, hierarchical transformers have also gained significant attention, thanks to their performance and easy integration into existing frameworks. These models typically employ localized attention mechanisms, such as the sliding-window Neighborhood Attention (NA) or Swin Transformer's Shifted Window Self Attention. While effective at reducing self attention's quadratic complexity, local attention weakens two of the most desirable properties of self attention: long range inter-dependency modeling, and global receptive field. In this paper, we introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), a natural, flexible and efficient extension to NA that can capture more global context and expand receptive fields exponentially at no additional cost. NA's local attention and DiNA's sparse global attention complement each other, and therefore we introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer (DiNAT), a new hierarchical vision transformer built upon both. DiNAT variants enjoy significant improvements over strong baselines such as NAT, Swin, and ConvNeXt. Our large model is faster and ahead of its Swin counterpart by 1.6% box AP in COCO object detection, 1.4% mask AP in COCO instance segmentation, and 1.4% mIoU in ADE20K semantic segmentation. Paired with new frameworks, our large variant is the new state of the art panoptic segmentation model on COCO (58.5 PQ) and ADE20K (49.4 PQ), and instance segmentation model on Cityscapes (45.1 AP) and ADE20K (35.4 AP) (no extra data). It also matches the state of the art specialized semantic segmentation models on ADE20K (58.1 mIoU), and ranks second on Cityscapes (84.5 mIoU) (no extra data).\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-29\n\n\n\n\n",

[2017], with dot-product attention as the fundamental component, have emerged as dominant architectures in various artificial intelligence tasks, especially in language modeling Brown et al. [2020], Devlin et al. [2019]. By enabling direct interaction between every pair of elements in a sequence, Transformers overcome the limitations of long-range dependencies and enable parallelization, which make them validly scale up to efficiently learn and exhibit emergent abilities Kaplan et al. [2020]. However, Transformers face the challenge of high computational costs in dot-product attention operations, which scale quadratically with the length of the sequence. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) Hochreiter and Schmidhuber [1997], Chung et al. [2014] naturally offer low computational costs with linearly scaling in space and time requirements. The reason is that RNNs generate the currently hidden states $h_{t}$ giving the current input and previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ at position $t$. Unfortunately, this sequential nature leads to RNNs being unable to parallel and bear the gradient vanishing problem, with the result that they lack scalability Hochreiter [1998], Le and Zuidema [2016]. To achieve parallelization and low computational costs, the architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) Peng et al. [2023], redesigns the tensor-product attention Zhai et al. [2021] as a linear attention mechanism with a time-sequential mode similar to RNNs. Regretfully, the RWKV cannot afford to capture long-range dependencies over long sequences since the information would be lost in the sequential flow, in contrast to standard attentions Bahdanau et al. [2016]. In this paper, we propose the Retrospected Receptance Weighted Key Value (RRWKV) architecture based on RWKV for discharging long-range interactions and performing efficient information flow in which mediums are incorporated. Especially, the RRWKV model is to obtain the appropriate messages specifically addressing the issues of information redundancy that may occur with the attention mechanisms and information loss with the RWKV. ## 2 Background\n\nIn this section, we will briefly introduce the development history of RWKV from the standard transformer architectures and then analyse the reasons of lacking long-range dependencies in RWKV. On the one hand, we discuss dot-product\n\n[^0]attention and tensor-product attention in standard transformer architectures. On the other hand, we uncover the underlying ideas of two blocks in RWKV and the deficiencies they bring. ### 2.1 Standard Transformer Architecture\n\nHere we simply review the core components of Transformers, attention mechanisms. Attention mechanisms leverage query, key, and value components to facilitate information selection. The query encapsulates the context of a specific matter, while the keys and values correspond to the input elements. By evaluating compatibility between the query and each key, attention weights are assigned to the corresponding values. These weighted values are then summed, enabling the matter to incorporate pertinent information from values. ### 2.1.1 Dot-Product Attention\n\nIn dot-product attention Vaswani et al. [2017], attention weights are determined by taking the dot product between the query and key vectors. The dot-product serves as a measure of similarity and represents the compatibility between the query and key. Mathematically, for a given sequence of tokens, the dot-product attention can be expressed as follows:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Atten}(Q, K, V)_{t}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\exp \\left(q_{t}^{T} k_{i}\\right) \\cdot v_{i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\exp \\left(q_{t}^{T} k_{i}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere $q$ represents the query vector, $k$ represents the key vector, $v$ represents the value vector, and scaling factor is neglected for convenience. Dot-product attention effectively implements the core idea of attention mechanisms and allows for parallel computation at each time step. However, it is constrained by the quadratic calculation and storage requirements of the similarity matrix, limiting its capabilities. ### 2.1.2 Tensor-Product Attention\n\nIn tensor-product attention Zhai et al. [2021], the determination of attention weights is based on the key vectors and position biases, replacing the conventional use of key and query vectors Bahdanau et al. [2016], Vaswani et al. [2017]. The tensor-product performs the role of feature interaction between the query and the weighted sum value. Correspondingly, the tensor-product attention can be expressed as follows:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Atten}(Q, K, V)_{t}=\\sigma\\left(q_{t}\\right) \\odot \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\exp \\left(k_{i}+w_{t, i}\\right) \\odot v_{i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\exp \\left(k_{i}+w_{t, i}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere each $w_{t, i}$ is a learned scalar which introduces an offset in the key vector $i$. This implies that key vectors can be adjusted to be more suitable for the specific query at time $t$. Although the tensor-product attention still retains the same high computational costs as the dot-product attention, it can be transformed into a linear complexity operation by disregarding the position biases. ### 2.2 Receptance Weighted Key Value Architecture\n\nHere we briefly analyse the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture which combines the sequential mode of RNNs and then achieves the linear calculation and storage costs.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 3.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/51 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\n# Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training \n\nSonglin Yang ${ }^{1 *}$ Bailin Wang ${ }^{1 *}$ Yikang Shen ${ }^{2}$ Rameswar Panda ${ }^{2}$ Yoon Kim ${ }^{1}$\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nTransformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Introduction\n\nThe Transformer architecture has achieved widespread adoption, particularly in the domain of large language models\n\n[^0]Preliminary work., Copyright 2024 by the author(s). (LLM) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Peng et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b) and multi-modal models (Li et al., 2022; 2023a; Liu et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b; Lu et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023a; Hao et al., 2024). However, its computational complexity grows quadratically with the length of the input sequence, making it challenging to model extremely long sequences. Unlimited sequence length stands out as a noteworthy aspect within the realm of LLM, attracting considerable attention from researchers who seek intelligent solutions. The potential applications of LLM with unlimited sequence length are diverse, encompassing extended conversations in various professional domains and handling a vast number of tokens in multimodal modeling tasks. In response to the quadratic complexity challenge, a promising resolution emerges in the form of linear attention. This method involves the elimination of the softmax operation and capitalizes on the associativity property of matrix products. Consequently, it significantly accelerates both training and inference procedures. To elaborate, linear attention reduces the computational complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) to compute the attention matrices, where $n$ represents the sequence length. This avenue holds substantial promise for augmenting the efficiency of transformer-style models across a broad spectrum of applications. It is important to note that the notable reduction in complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ in linear attention is only theoretical and may not directly translate to a proportional improvement in computational efficiency on hardware in practice. The realization of practical wall-clock speedup faces challenges, primarily stemming from two issues: 1). the dominance of memory access (I/O) on the GPU could impact the overall computation speed of attention. 2). the cumulative summation (cumsum) needed by the linear attention kernel trick prevents it from reaching its theoretical training speed in the causal setting. The first issue has been successfully addressed by Lightning Attention-1 (Qin et al., 2023b). In this paper, we introduce\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ae38c698417dafba3079g-02.jpg?height=521&width=1709&top_left_y=213&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 1. Speed Showdown: FlashAttention vs. Lightning Attention in Expanding Sequence Lengths and Model Sizes. The diagram above provides a comparative illustration of training speed, Token per GPU per Second (TGS) for LLaMA with FlashAttention-2, TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-1 and TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-2, implemented across three model sizes: 400M, 1B, and 3B from left to right. It is strikingly evident that Lightning Attention-2 manifests a consistent training speed irrespective of the increasing sequence length. Conversely, the other methods significantly decline training speed as the sequence length expands. Lightning Attention-2 to solve the second issue. The key idea is to leverage the concept of \"divide and conquer\" by separately handling the intra block and inter block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, for the intra blocks, we maintain the use of conventional attention computation mechanism to compute the product of QKV, while for the inter blocks, we employ the linear attention kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b). Tiling techniques are implemented in both forward and backward procedures to fully leverage GPU hardware capabilities. As a result, the Lightning Attention-2 can train LLMs with unlimited sequence length without extra cost ${ }^{1}$, as its computational speed remains constant with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of Lightning Attention-2 across a diverse range of sequence lengths to assess its accuracy and compare its computational speed and memory utilization with FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) and Lightning Attention-1. The findings indicate that Lightning Attention-2 exhibits a notable advantage in computational speed, attributed to its innovative intra-inter separation strategy. Additionally, Lightning Attention-2 demonstrates a reduced memory footprint compared to its counterparts without compromising performance. ## 2. Related Work\n\n### 2.1.

Score: 0.95)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 59/74 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n- RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT (attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)), another variant of linear attention. Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs. We also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer's MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP blocks. ## B. 3 Relationship to RNNs\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state. Several older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n- They do not use state expansion $(N=1)$ or selective $B, C$ parameters, both of which are important for performance (Section 4.6). - They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism + discretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and initializations (Section 3.6). Additionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991; Hochreiter, Bengio, et al. 2001; Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The former could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the latter was difficult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 14 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: Gated Linear Attention, RWKV integration, Linear Attention Efficiency\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a significant step towards reconciling trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 352  (*Influential: 34*)\n\n#### 4.

However, current models exhibit several limitations, such as the generation of invalid molecular SMILES, underutilization of contextual information, and equal treatment of structured and unstructured knowledge. To address these issues, we propose $\\mathbf{BioT5}$, a comprehensive pre-training framework that enriches cross-modal integration in biology with chemical knowledge and natural language associations. $\\mathbf{BioT5}$ utilizes SELFIES for $100%$ robust molecular representations and extracts knowledge from the surrounding context of bio-entities in unstructured biological literature. Furthermore, $\\mathbf{BioT5}$ distinguishes between structured and unstructured knowledge, leading to more effective utilization of information. After fine-tuning, BioT5 shows superior performance across a wide range of tasks, demonstrating its strong capability of capturing underlying relations and properties of bio-entities.

Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model for Realistic Image Deblurring\n\n*From Search Query: RWKV integration*\n\n*Zheng Chen, Yulun Zhang, Ding Liu, Bin Xia, Jinjin Gu, L. Kong, X. Yuan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff) is proposed, which designs the hierarchical integration module to fuse the prior into the regression-based model from multiple scales, enabling better generalization in complex blurry scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** Diffusion models (DMs) have recently been introduced in image deblurring and exhibited promising performance, particularly in terms of details reconstruction. However, the diffusion model requires a large number of inference iterations to recover the clean image from pure Gaussian noise, which consumes massive computational resources. Moreover, the distribution synthesized by the diffusion model is often misaligned with the target results, leading to restrictions in distortion-based metrics. To address the above issues, we propose the Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff), for realistic image deblurring. Specifically, we perform the DM in a highly compacted latent space to generate the prior feature for the deblurring process. The deblurring process is implemented by a regression-based method to obtain better distortion accuracy. Meanwhile, the highly compact latent space ensures the efficiency of the DM. Furthermore, we design the hierarchical integration module to fuse the prior into the regression-based model from multiple scales, enabling better generalization in complex blurry scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world blur datasets demonstrate that our HI-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Span-Selective Linear Attention Transformers for Effective and Robust Schema-Guided Dialogue State Tracking\n\n*From Search Query: Linear Attention Efficiency*\n\n*Bj\u00f6rn Bebensee, Haejun Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** In schema-guided dialogue state tracking models estimate the current state of a conversation using natural language descriptions of the service schema for generalization to unseen services. Prior generative approaches which decode slot values sequentially do not generalize well to variations in schema, while discriminative approaches separately encode history and schema and fail to account for inter-slot and intent-slot dependencies. We introduce SPLAT, a novel architecture which achieves better generalization and efficiency than prior approaches by constraining outputs to a limited prediction space. At the same time, our model allows for rich attention among descriptions and history while keeping computation costs constrained by incorporating linear-time attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and MultiWOZ datasets. Our approach significantly improves upon existing models achieving 85.3 JGA on the SGD dataset. Further, we show increased robustness on the SGD-X benchmark: our model outperforms the more than 30x larger D3ST-XXL model by 5.0 points.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.

Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Attention*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Towards Resilient and Efficient LLMs: A Comparative Study of Efficiency,\n  Performance, and Adversarial Robustness\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Attention*\n\n*Xiaojing Fan, Chunliang Tao*\n\n**Abstract:** With the increasing demand for practical applications of Large Language\nModels (LLMs), many attention-efficient models have been developed to balance\nperformance and computational cost.

The AdvGLUE dataset extends the GLUE dataset with adversarial\nsamples designed to challenge model robustness. Our results show that while the\nGLA Transformer and MatMul-Free LM achieve slightly lower accuracy on GLUE\ntasks, they demonstrate higher efficiency and either superior or comparative\nrobustness on AdvGLUE tasks compared to Transformer++ across different attack\nlevels. These findings highlight the potential of simplified architectures to\nachieve a compelling balance between efficiency, performance, and adversarial\nrobustness, offering valuable insights for applications where resource\nconstraints and resilience to adversarial attacks are critical.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-08T16:54:40Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-14T03:19:10Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

This paper introduces Gated Slot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control (ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via softmax, utilizing context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity while maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances both training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient training algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the softmax operation is particularly beneficial in \"finetuning pretrained Transformers to RNNs\" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch. Extensive experiments confirm GSA's superior performance in scenarios requiring in-context recall and in T2R settings.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. Optimizing Robotic Manipulation with Decision-RWKV: A Recurrent Sequence Modeling Approach for Lifelong Learning\n\n*From Search Query: RWKV integration*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Models based on the Transformer architecture have seen widespread application across fields such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, with large language models like ChatGPT revolutionizing machine understanding of human language and demonstrating impressive memory and reproduction capabilities. Traditional machine learning algorithms struggle with catastrophic forgetting, which is detrimental to the diverse and generalized abilities required for robotic deployment.

LION: Linear Group RNN for 3D Object Detection in Point Clouds\n\n*From Search Query: RWKV integration*\n\n*Xiang Bai, Hengshuang Zhao, Jingdong Wang, Xiaoqing Ye, Xinyu Wang, Jinghua Hou, Zhe Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** The benefit of transformers in large-scale 3D point cloud perception tasks, such as 3D object detection, is limited by their quadratic computation cost when modeling long-range relationships. In contrast, linear RNNs have low computational complexity and are suitable for long-range modeling. Toward this goal, we propose a simple and effective window-based framework built on LInear grOup RNN (i.e., perform linear RNN for grouped features) for accurate 3D object detection, called LION. The key property is to allow sufficient feature interaction in a much larger group than transformer-based methods. However, effectively applying linear group RNN to 3D object detection in highly sparse point clouds is not trivial due to its limitation in handling spatial modeling. To tackle this problem, we simply introduce a 3D spatial feature descriptor and integrate it into the linear group RNN operators to enhance their spatial features rather than blindly increasing the number of scanning orders for voxel features. To further address the challenge in highly sparse point clouds, we propose a 3D voxel generation strategy to densify foreground features thanks to linear group RNN as a natural property of auto-regressive models. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed components and the generalization of our LION on different linear group RNN operators including Mamba, RWKV, and RetNet. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that our LION-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art on Waymo, nuScenes, Argoverse V2, and ONCE dataset. Last but not least, our method supports kinds of advanced linear RNN operators (e.g., RetNet, RWKV, Mamba, xLSTM and TTT) on small but popular KITTI dataset for a quick experience with our linear RNN-based framework.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-25\n\n\n\n#### 4. Efficient Attention: Attention with Linear Complexities\n\n*From Search Query: Linear Attention Efficiency*\n\n*Shuai Yi, Haiyu Zhao, Hongsheng Li, Zhuoran Shen, Mingyuan Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Dot-product attention has wide applications in computer vision and natural language processing. However, its memory and computational costs grow quadratically with the input size. Such growth prohibits its application on high-resolution inputs. To remedy this drawback, this paper proposes a novel efficient attention mechanism equivalent to dot-product attention but with substantially less memory and computational costs. Its resource efficiency allows more widespread and flexible integration of attention modules into a network, which leads to better accuracies. Empirical evaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of its advantages. Efficient attention modules brought significant performance boosts to object detectors and instance segmenters on MS-COCO 2017. Further, the resource efficiency democratizes attention to complex models, where high costs prohibit the use of dot-product attention. As an exemplar, a model with efficient attention achieved state-of-the-art accuracies for stereo depth estimation on the Scene Flow dataset.

[2017], with dot-product attention as the fundamental component, have emerged as dominant architectures in various artificial intelligence tasks, especially in language modeling Brown et al. [2020], Devlin et al. [2019]. By enabling direct interaction between every pair of elements in a sequence, Transformers overcome the limitations of long-range dependencies and enable parallelization, which make them validly scale up to efficiently learn and exhibit emergent abilities Kaplan et al. [2020]. However, Transformers face the challenge of high computational costs in dot-product attention operations, which scale quadratically with the length of the sequence. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) Hochreiter and Schmidhuber [1997], Chung et al. [2014] naturally offer low computational costs with linearly scaling in space and time requirements. The reason is that RNNs generate the currently hidden states $h_{t}$ giving the current input and previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ at position $t$. Unfortunately, this sequential nature leads to RNNs being unable to parallel and bear the gradient vanishing problem, with the result that they lack scalability Hochreiter [1998], Le and Zuidema [2016]. To achieve parallelization and low computational costs, the architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) Peng et al. [2023], redesigns the tensor-product attention Zhai et al. [2021] as a linear attention mechanism with a time-sequential mode similar to RNNs. Regretfully, the RWKV cannot afford to capture long-range dependencies over long sequences since the information would be lost in the sequential flow, in contrast to standard attentions Bahdanau et al. [2016]. In this paper, we propose the Retrospected Receptance Weighted Key Value (RRWKV) architecture based on RWKV for discharging long-range interactions and performing efficient information flow in which mediums are incorporated. Especially, the RRWKV model is to obtain the appropriate messages specifically addressing the issues of information redundancy that may occur with the attention mechanisms and information loss with the RWKV. ## 2 Background\n\nIn this section, we will briefly introduce the development history of RWKV from the standard transformer architectures and then analyse the reasons of lacking long-range dependencies in RWKV. On the one hand, we discuss dot-product\n\n[^0]attention and tensor-product attention in standard transformer architectures. On the other hand, we uncover the underlying ideas of two blocks in RWKV and the deficiencies they bring. ### 2.1 Standard Transformer Architecture\n\nHere we simply review the core components of Transformers, attention mechanisms. Attention mechanisms leverage query, key, and value components to facilitate information selection. The query encapsulates the context of a specific matter, while the keys and values correspond to the input elements. By evaluating compatibility between the query and each key, attention weights are assigned to the corresponding values. These weighted values are then summed, enabling the matter to incorporate pertinent information from values. ### 2.1.1 Dot-Product Attention\n\nIn dot-product attention Vaswani et al. [2017], attention weights are determined by taking the dot product between the query and key vectors. The dot-product serves as a measure of similarity and represents the compatibility between the query and key. Mathematically, for a given sequence of tokens, the dot-product attention can be expressed as follows:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Atten}(Q, K, V)_{t}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\exp \\left(q_{t}^{T} k_{i}\\right) \\cdot v_{i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\exp \\left(q_{t}^{T} k_{i}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere $q$ represents the query vector, $k$ represents the key vector, $v$ represents the value vector, and scaling factor is neglected for convenience. Dot-product attention effectively implements the core idea of attention mechanisms and allows for parallel computation at each time step. However, it is constrained by the quadratic calculation and storage requirements of the similarity matrix, limiting its capabilities. ### 2.1.2 Tensor-Product Attention\n\nIn tensor-product attention Zhai et al. [2021], the determination of attention weights is based on the key vectors and position biases, replacing the conventional use of key and query vectors Bahdanau et al. [2016], Vaswani et al. [2017]. The tensor-product performs the role of feature interaction between the query and the weighted sum value. Correspondingly, the tensor-product attention can be expressed as follows:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Atten}(Q, K, V)_{t}=\\sigma\\left(q_{t}\\right) \\odot \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\exp \\left(k_{i}+w_{t, i}\\right) \\odot v_{i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\exp \\left(k_{i}+w_{t, i}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere each $w_{t, i}$ is a learned scalar which introduces an offset in the key vector $i$. This implies that key vectors can be adjusted to be more suitable for the specific query at time $t$. Although the tensor-product attention still retains the same high computational costs as the dot-product attention, it can be transformed into a linear complexity operation by disregarding the position biases. ### 2.2 Receptance Weighted Key Value Architecture\n\nHere we briefly analyse the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture which combines the sequential mode of RNNs and then achieves the linear calculation and storage costs.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 3. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 59/74 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n- RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT (attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)), another variant of linear attention. Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs. We also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer's MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP blocks. ## B. 3 Relationship to RNNs\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state. Several older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n- They do not use state expansion $(N=1)$ or selective $B, C$ parameters, both of which are important for performance (Section 4.6). - They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism + discretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and initializations (Section 3.6). Additionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991; Hochreiter, Bengio, et al. 2001; Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The former could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the latter was difficult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 4.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations.

Introduction\n\nThe Transformer architecture has achieved widespread adoption, particularly in the domain of large language models\n\n[^0]Preliminary work., Copyright 2024 by the author(s). (LLM) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Peng et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b) and multi-modal models (Li et al., 2022; 2023a; Liu et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b; Lu et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023a; Hao et al., 2024). However, its computational complexity grows quadratically with the length of the input sequence, making it challenging to model extremely long sequences. Unlimited sequence length stands out as a noteworthy aspect within the realm of LLM, attracting considerable attention from researchers who seek intelligent solutions. The potential applications of LLM with unlimited sequence length are diverse, encompassing extended conversations in various professional domains and handling a vast number of tokens in multimodal modeling tasks. In response to the quadratic complexity challenge, a promising resolution emerges in the form of linear attention. This method involves the elimination of the softmax operation and capitalizes on the associativity property of matrix products. Consequently, it significantly accelerates both training and inference procedures. To elaborate, linear attention reduces the computational complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) to compute the attention matrices, where $n$ represents the sequence length. This avenue holds substantial promise for augmenting the efficiency of transformer-style models across a broad spectrum of applications. It is important to note that the notable reduction in complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ in linear attention is only theoretical and may not directly translate to a proportional improvement in computational efficiency on hardware in practice. The realization of practical wall-clock speedup faces challenges, primarily stemming from two issues: 1). the dominance of memory access (I/O) on the GPU could impact the overall computation speed of attention. 2). the cumulative summation (cumsum) needed by the linear attention kernel trick prevents it from reaching its theoretical training speed in the causal setting. The first issue has been successfully addressed by Lightning Attention-1 (Qin et al., 2023b). In this paper, we introduce\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ae38c698417dafba3079g-02.jpg?height=521&width=1709&top_left_y=213&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 1. Speed Showdown: FlashAttention vs. Lightning Attention in Expanding Sequence Lengths and Model Sizes. The diagram above provides a comparative illustration of training speed, Token per GPU per Second (TGS) for LLaMA with FlashAttention-2, TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-1 and TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-2, implemented across three model sizes: 400M, 1B, and 3B from left to right. It is strikingly evident that Lightning Attention-2 manifests a consistent training speed irrespective of the increasing sequence length. Conversely, the other methods significantly decline training speed as the sequence length expands. Lightning Attention-2 to solve the second issue. The key idea is to leverage the concept of \"divide and conquer\" by separately handling the intra block and inter block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, for the intra blocks, we maintain the use of conventional attention computation mechanism to compute the product of QKV, while for the inter blocks, we employ the linear attention kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b). Tiling techniques are implemented in both forward and backward procedures to fully leverage GPU hardware capabilities. As a result, the Lightning Attention-2 can train LLMs with unlimited sequence length without extra cost ${ }^{1}$, as its computational speed remains constant with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of Lightning Attention-2 across a diverse range of sequence lengths to assess its accuracy and compare its computational speed and memory utilization with FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) and Lightning Attention-1. The findings indicate that Lightning Attention-2 exhibits a notable advantage in computational speed, attributed to its innovative intra-inter separation strategy. Additionally, Lightning Attention-2 demonstrates a reduced memory footprint compared to its counterparts without compromising performance. ## 2. Related Work\n\n### 2.1.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability.

Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Attention*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Towards Resilient and Efficient LLMs: A Comparative Study of Efficiency,\n  Performance, and Adversarial Robustness\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Attention*\n\n*Xiaojing Fan, Chunliang Tao*\n\n**Abstract:** With the increasing demand for practical applications of Large Language\nModels (LLMs), many attention-efficient models have been developed to balance\nperformance and computational cost. However, the adversarial robustness of\nthese models remains under-explored. In this work, we design a framework to\ninvestigate the trade-off between efficiency, performance, and adversarial\nrobustness of LLMs and conduct extensive experiments on three prominent models\nwith varying levels of complexity and efficiency -- Transformer++, Gated Linear\nAttention (GLA) Transformer, and MatMul-Free LM -- utilizing the GLUE and\nAdvGLUE datasets. The AdvGLUE dataset extends the GLUE dataset with adversarial\nsamples designed to challenge model robustness. Our results show that while the\nGLA Transformer and MatMul-Free LM achieve slightly lower accuracy on GLUE\ntasks, they demonstrate higher efficiency and either superior or comparative\nrobustness on AdvGLUE tasks compared to Transformer++ across different attack\nlevels. These findings highlight the potential of simplified architectures to\nachieve a compelling balance between efficiency, performance, and adversarial\nrobustness, offering valuable insights for applications where resource\nconstraints and resilience to adversarial attacks are critical.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-08T16:54:40Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-14T03:19:10Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Enhancing Transformer RNNs with Multiple Temporal Perspectives\n\n*From Search Query: RWKV architecture*\n\n*Razvan-Gabriel Dumitru, Darius Peteleaza, Mihai Surdeanu*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce the concept of multiple temporal perspectives, a novel approach\napplicable to Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures for enhancing their\nunderstanding of sequential data. This method involves maintaining diverse\ntemporal views of previously encountered text, significantly enriching the\nlanguage models' capacity to interpret context. To show the efficacy of this\napproach, we incorporate it into the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV)\narchitecture, addressing its inherent challenge of retaining all historical\ninformation within a single hidden state. Notably, this improvement is achieved\nwith a minimal increase in the number of parameters --even as little as\n$0.04\\%$ of the original number of parameters. Further, the additional\nparameters necessary for the multiple temporal perspectives are fine-tuned with\nminimal computational overhead, avoiding the need for a full pre-training. The\nresulting model maintains linear computational complexity during prompt\ninference, ensuring consistent efficiency across various sequence lengths. The\nempirical results and ablation studies included in our research validate the\neffectiveness of our approach, showcasing improved performance across multiple\nbenchmarks.

RRWKV: Capturing Long-range Dependencies in RWKV\n\n*From Search Query: RWKV architecture*\n\n*Leilei Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Owing to the impressive dot-product attention, the Transformers have been the\ndominant architectures in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.\nRecently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture follows a\nnon-transformer architecture to eliminate the drawbacks of dot-product\nattention, where memory and computational complexity exhibits quadratic scaling\nwith sequence length. Although RWKV has exploited a linearly tensor-product\nattention mechanism and achieved parallelized computations by deploying the\ntime-sequential mode, it fails to capture long-range dependencies because of\nits limitation on looking back at previous information, compared with full\ninformation obtained by direct interactions in the standard transformer.\nTherefore, the paper devises the Retrospected Receptance Weighted Key Value\n(RRWKV) architecture via incorporating the retrospecting ability into the RWKV\nto effectively absorb information, which maintains memory and computational\nefficiency as well.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-08T13:17:06Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-13T08:58:47Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

This paper introduces Gated Slot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control (ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via softmax, utilizing context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity while maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances both training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient training algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the softmax operation is particularly beneficial in \"finetuning pretrained Transformers to RNNs\" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch. Extensive experiments confirm GSA's superior performance in scenarios requiring in-context recall and in T2R settings.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-11\n\n\n\n#### 2.

This paper introduces Vision-RWKV (VRWKV), a model adapted from the RWKV model used in the NLP field with necessary modifications for vision tasks. Similar to the Vision Transformer (ViT), our model is designed to efficiently handle sparse inputs and demonstrate robust global processing capabilities, while also scaling up effectively, accommodating both large-scale parameters and extensive datasets. Its distinctive advantage lies in its reduced spatial aggregation complexity, which renders it exceptionally adept at processing high-resolution images seamlessly, eliminating the necessity for windowing operations. Our evaluations demonstrate that VRWKV surpasses ViT's performance in image classification and has significantly faster speeds and lower memory usage processing high-resolution inputs. In dense prediction tasks, it outperforms window-based models, maintaining comparable speeds. These results highlight VRWKV's potential as a more efficient alternative for visual perception tasks.

Introducing Intermediate Domains for Effective Self-Training during Test-Time\n\n*From Search Query: Test-Time Training*\n\n*Bin Yang, Mario D\u00f6bler, Robert A. Marsden*\n\n**Abstract:** Experiencing domain shifts during test-time is nearly inevitable in practice and likely results in a severe performance degradation. To overcome this issue, test-time adaptation continues to update the initial source model during deployment. A promising direction are methods based on self-training which have been shown to be well suited for gradual domain adaptation, since reliable pseudo-labels can be provided. In this work, we address two problems that exist when applying self-training in the setting of test-time adaptation. First, adapting a model to long test sequences that contain multiple domains can lead to error accumulation. Second, naturally, not all shifts are gradual in practice. To tackle these challenges, we introduce GTTA. By creating artificial intermediate domains that divide the current domain shift into a more gradual one, effective self-training through high quality pseudo-labels can be performed. To create the intermediate domains, we propose two independent variations: mixup and light-weight style transfer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the continual and gradual corruption benchmarks, as well as ImageNet-R. To further investigate gradual shifts in the context of urban scene segmentation, we publish a new benchmark: CarlaTTA. It enables the exploration of several non-stationary domain shifts.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-16\n\n\n\n#### 5. Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States\n\n*From Search Query: Test-Time Training*\n\n*Carlos Guestrin, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Sanmi Koyejo, Xiaolong Wang, Xinlei Chen, Yann Dubois, Genghan Zhang, Arjun Vikram, Jiarui Xu, Karan Dalal, Xinhao Li, Yu Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-05\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design by integrating Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and the RWKV architecture into the TTTLinear GAU, here are some key points and references that can guide the research:\n\n## Gated Linear Attention (GLA)\n\n- GLA is designed to reduce computational complexity while maintaining model expressiveness. It uses a gated structure to control the flow of information, which is crucial for handling long sequences efficiently. The gated mechanism helps in smoothly reducing the impact of past information, preventing the values in the recurrent state from growing uncontrollably.\n- Existing implementations of GLA have shown promising results in terms of computational efficiency and stability. For instance, the Gated Linear Transformer (GaLiTe) and its approximate version (AGaLiTe) have demonstrated faster learning and better stability compared to traditional transformers and RNNs.\n\n## RWKV Architecture\n\n- The RWKV architecture combines elements of RNNs and transformers, leveraging the strengths of both. It uses element-wise recurrence and maintains a state in a ratio form, which is updated separately by two state space models (SSMs). This approach enhances efficiency and inference capabilities, particularly for long sequences.\n- The hybrid nature of RWKV allows it to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies effectively, making it a suitable candidate for integration with linear attention mechanisms. The RWKV architecture has been shown to perform well in various tasks, including those requiring long-term memory and sequential processing.\n\n## Test-Time Training (TTT)\n\n- Maintaining test-time training capabilities is crucial for adapting the model to new data or tasks without extensive retraining. The TTTLinear GAU aims to retain this flexibility while integrating GLA and RWKV concepts.\n- The integration of GLA and RWKV can potentially enhance the model's ability to adapt at test time by providing more efficient and stable mechanisms for processing new sequences. This could be particularly beneficial in scenarios where the model needs to learn from a few examples or adapt to changing contexts.\n\n## Comparison with Existing Work\n\n- The proposal to integrate GLA and RWKV into TTTLinear appears novel, especially in the context of maintaining test-time training capabilities. However, it is important to compare this approach with existing research on linear attention mechanisms and hybrid architectures.\n- For example, the normalized Transformer (nGPT) architecture, which normalizes all vectors to unit norm, has shown accelerated convergence and improved stability. This could provide additional insights into how normalization and linear attention can be combined for better performance.\n\n## Potential Impact on Performance Metrics\n\n- **Perplexity and Accuracy**: The integration of GLA and RWKV is expected to improve the model's ability to handle long sequences efficiently, potentially reducing perplexity and improving accuracy in language modeling tasks.\n- **Robustness**: The gated mechanism in GLA and the hybrid approach of RWKV can enhance the model's robustness to variant inputs by providing more stable and controlled information flow.\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**: Both GLA and RWKV are designed to be computationally efficient and scalable. The linear attention mechanism reduces the computational complexity from \\(O(n^2)\\) to \\(O(n)\\), making the model more suitable for large-scale applications.\n- **Test-Time Training**: The ability to adapt at test time can significantly improve the model's performance in dynamic environments, where new data or tasks are encountered frequently.\n\n### References and Further Reading\n\n- For detailed technical documents on GLA, the paper \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\" by Yang et al. (2023) would be a valuable resource.\n- The RWKV architecture is extensively discussed in \"RWKV: Reinventing RNNs for the Transformer Era\" by Peng et al. (2023).\n- The integration of linear attention with autoregressive decoding is explored in \"When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models\" by You et al. (2024).\n\nBy combining the strengths of GLA and the RWKV architecture, the TTTLinear GAU can potentially achieve significant improvements in computational efficiency, scalability, and test-time training capabilities, making it a robust and adaptable autoregressive language model.\n",

Codes and models are available at https://github. com/GATECH-EIC/Linearized-LLM. ## 1. Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 3.

We introduce a method to reduce this to linear scaling with time, based on defining attention via latent vectors. The method is readily usable as a drop-in replacement for the standard attention mechanism. Our\"Latte Transformer\"model can be implemented for both bidirectional and unidirectional tasks, with the causal version allowing a recurrent implementation which is memory and time-efficient during inference of language generation tasks. Whilst next token prediction scales linearly with the sequence length for a standard transformer, a Latte Transformer requires constant time to compute the next token. The empirical performance of our method is comparable to standard attention, yet allows scaling to context windows much larger than practical in standard attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/21 (Score: 0.82)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2112.05682, 2021.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.81)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we introduced Lightning Attention-2, a pioneering implementation of linear attention that effectively harnesses its theoretical computational advantages, particularly in the causal setting. Our approach, which adopts the concepts of \"divide and conquer\" and tiling techniques, successfully addresses the limitations of current linear attention algorithms, especially the challenges associated with cumulative summation. By separating the computation into intrablock and inter-block components, we effectively leverage GPU hardware to its fullest potential, ensuring efficiency. Our extensive experiments across various model sizes and sequence lengths demonstrate that Lightning Attention-2 not only maintains consistent training speeds regardless of input sequence length but also outperforms existing state-ofthe-art attention mechanisms in terms of speed and accuracy. This breakthrough has profound implications for the future of large language models, particularly those requiring the processing of long sequences. Looking ahead, we intend to introduce sequence parallelism in conjunction with Lightning Attention-2, which aims to facilitate the training of extra-long sequences, effectively overcoming existing hardware constraints. ## Acknowledgement\n\nThis work is partially supported by the National Key R\\&D Program of China (NO.2022ZD0160100).

For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 18 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: Linear Attention Mechanisms, Hybrid Architectures, Test-Time Training\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: Linear Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: it replaces the softmax activation with a ReLU, and shows that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2.

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 1314  (*Influential: 183*)\n\n#### 3. Efficient Attention via Control Variates\n\n*From Search Query: Linear Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Lin Zheng, Jianbo Yuan, Chong Wang, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. HUMUS-Net: Hybrid unrolled multi-scale network architecture for accelerated MRI reconstruction\n\n*From Search Query: Hybrid Architectures*\n\n*Zalan Fabian, M. Soltanolkotabi*\n\n**TL;DR:** HUMUS-Net is proposed, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network that establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset.\n\n**Abstract:** In accelerated MRI reconstruction, the anatomy of a patient is recovered from a set of under-sampled and noisy measurements. Deep learning approaches have been proven to be successful in solving this ill-posed inverse problem and are capable of producing very high quality reconstructions. However, current architectures heavily rely on convolutions, that are content-independent and have difficulties modeling long-range dependencies in images. Recently, Transformers, the workhorse of contemporary natural language processing, have emerged as powerful building blocks for a multitude of vision tasks. These models split input images into non-overlapping patches, embed the patches into lower-dimensional tokens and utilize a self-attention mechanism that does not suffer from the aforementioned weaknesses of convolutional architectures. However, Transformers incur extremely high compute and memory cost when 1) the input image resolution is high and 2) when the image needs to be split into a large number of patches to preserve fine detail information, both of which are typical in low-level vision problems such as MRI reconstruction, having a compounding effect. To tackle these challenges, we propose HUMUS-Net, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network. HUMUS-Net extracts high-resolution features via convolutional blocks and refines low-resolution features via a novel Transformer-based multi-scale feature extractor. Features from both levels are then synthesized into a high-resolution output reconstruction. Our network establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset. We further demonstrate the performance of HUMUS-Net on two other popular MRI datasets and perform fine-grained ablation studies to validate our design.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5. HybridBERT - Making BERT Pretraining More Efficient Through Hybrid Mixture of Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: Hybrid Architectures*\n\n*Gokul Srinivasagan, Simon Ostermann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization, and shows that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline.\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained transformer-based language models have produced state-of-the-art performance in most natural language understanding tasks. These models undergo two stages of training: pretraining on a huge corpus of data and fine-tuning on a specific downstream task. The pretraining phase is extremely compute-intensive and requires several high-performance computing devices like GPUs and several days or even months of training, but it is crucial for the model to capture global knowledge and also has a significant impact on the fine-tuning task. This is a major roadblock for researchers without access to sophisticated computing resources. To overcome this challenge, we propose two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization. We introduce a computing budget to the pretraining phase, limiting the training time and usage to a single GPU. We show that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline. We also evaluate our proposed models on two downstream tasks, where we outperform BERT-base while accelerating inference. Moreover, we study the effect of weight initialization with a limited pretraining budget.

Despite encouraging results, it remains unclear when this approach thrives or fails. In this work, we \ufb01rst provide an in-depth look at its limitations and show that TTT can possibly deteriorate, instead of improving, the test-time performance in the presence of severe distribution shifts. To address this issue, we introduce a test-time feature alignment strategy utilizing of\ufb02ine feature summarization and online moment matching, which regularizes adaptation without revisiting training data. We further scale this strategy in the online setting through batch-queue decoupling to enable robust moment estimates even with limited batch size. Given aligned feature distributions, we then shed light on the strong potential of TTT by theoretically analyzing its performance post adaptation. This analysis motivates our use of more informative self-supervision in the form of contrastive learning for visual recognition problems. We empirically demonstrate that our modi\ufb01ed version of test-time training, termed TTT++ , outperforms state-of-the-art methods by signi\ufb01cant margins on several benchmarks.

Linear Complexity Randomized Self-attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: Linear Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Lingpeng Kong, Chong Wang, Lin Zheng*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, random feature attentions (RFAs) are proposed to approximate the softmax attention in linear time and space complexity by linearizing the exponential kernel. In this paper, we first propose a novel perspective to understand the bias in such approximation by recasting RFAs as self-normalized importance samplers. This perspective further sheds light on an \\emph{unbiased} estimator for the whole softmax attention, called randomized attention (RA). RA constructs positive random features via query-specific distributions and enjoys greatly improved approximation fidelity, albeit exhibiting quadratic complexity. By combining the expressiveness in RA and the efficiency in RFA, we develop a novel linear complexity self-attention mechanism called linear randomized attention (LARA). Extensive experiments across various domains demonstrate that RA and LARA significantly improve the performance of RFAs by a substantial margin.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-10\n\n\n\n#### 2.

UTNet: A Hybrid Transformer Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: Hybrid Architectures*\n\n*Dimitris Metaxas, Mu Zhou, Yunhe Gao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architecture has emerged to be successful in a number of natural language processing tasks. However, its applications to medical vision remain largely unexplored. In this study, we present UTNet, a simple yet powerful hybrid Transformer architecture that integrates self-attention into a convolutional neural network for enhancing medical image segmentation. UTNet applies self-attention modules in both encoder and decoder for capturing long-range dependency at different scales with minimal overhead. To this end, we propose an efficient self-attention mechanism along with relative position encoding that reduces the complexity of self-attention operation significantly from $O(n^2)$ to approximate $O(n)$. A new self-attention decoder is also proposed to recover fine-grained details from the skipped connections in the encoder. Our approach addresses the dilemma that Transformer requires huge amounts of data to learn vision inductive bias. Our hybrid layer design allows the initialization of Transformer into convolutional networks without a need of pre-training. We have evaluated UTNet on the multi-label, multi-vendor cardiac magnetic resonance imaging cohort. UTNet demonstrates superior segmentation performance and robustness against the state-of-the-art approaches, holding the promise to generalize well on other medical image segmentations.\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-02\n\n\n\n#### 4. Mechanistic Design and Scaling of Hybrid Architectures\n\n*From Search Query: Hybrid Architectures*\n\n*Stefano Massaroli, Ce Zhang, Christopher R\u00e9, Stefano Ermon, Brian Hie, Taiji Suzuki, Kristian Kersting, Bj\u00f6rn Deiseroth, Pragaash Ponnusamy, Eric Nguyen, Armin W Thomas, Michael Poli*\n\n**Abstract:** The development of deep learning architectures is a resource-demanding process, due to a vast design space, long prototyping times, and high compute costs associated with at-scale model training and evaluation. We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-26\n\n\n\n#### 5. Introducing Intermediate Domains for Effective Self-Training during Test-Time\n\n*From Search Query: Test-Time Training*\n\n*Bin Yang, Mario D\u00f6bler, Robert A. Marsden*\n\n**Abstract:** Experiencing domain shifts during test-time is nearly inevitable in practice and likely results in a severe performance degradation. To overcome this issue, test-time adaptation continues to update the initial source model during deployment. A promising direction are methods based on self-training which have been shown to be well suited for gradual domain adaptation, since reliable pseudo-labels can be provided. In this work, we address two problems that exist when applying self-training in the setting of test-time adaptation. First, adapting a model to long test sequences that contain multiple domains can lead to error accumulation. Second, naturally, not all shifts are gradual in practice. To tackle these challenges, we introduce GTTA. By creating artificial intermediate domains that divide the current domain shift into a more gradual one, effective self-training through high quality pseudo-labels can be performed. To create the intermediate domains, we propose two independent variations: mixup and light-weight style transfer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the continual and gradual corruption benchmarks, as well as ImageNet-R. To further investigate gradual shifts in the context of urban scene segmentation, we publish a new benchmark: CarlaTTA. It enables the exploration of several non-stationary domain shifts.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-16\n\n\n\n#### 6. Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States\n\n*From Search Query: Test-Time Training*\n\n*Carlos Guestrin, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Sanmi Koyejo, Xiaolong Wang, Xinlei Chen, Yann Dubois, Genghan Zhang, Arjun Vikram, Jiarui Xu, Karan Dalal, Xinhao Li, Yu Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-05\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model by integrating linear attention mechanisms, hybrid architectures, and test-time training, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided context and additional research directions:\n\n### Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Gated Linear Attention (GLA):** GLA is particularly promising due to its data-dependent gating mechanism, which enhances expressiveness while reducing computational complexity.

[2017], with dot-product attention as the fundamental component, have emerged as dominant architectures in various artificial intelligence tasks, especially in language modeling Brown et al. [2020], Devlin et al. [2019]. By enabling direct interaction between every pair of elements in a sequence, Transformers overcome the limitations of long-range dependencies and enable parallelization, which make them validly scale up to efficiently learn and exhibit emergent abilities Kaplan et al. [2020]. However, Transformers face the challenge of high computational costs in dot-product attention operations, which scale quadratically with the length of the sequence. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) Hochreiter and Schmidhuber [1997], Chung et al. [2014] naturally offer low computational costs with linearly scaling in space and time requirements. The reason is that RNNs generate the currently hidden states $h_{t}$ giving the current input and previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ at position $t$. Unfortunately, this sequential nature leads to RNNs being unable to parallel and bear the gradient vanishing problem, with the result that they lack scalability Hochreiter [1998], Le and Zuidema [2016]. To achieve parallelization and low computational costs, the architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) Peng et al. [2023], redesigns the tensor-product attention Zhai et al. [2021] as a linear attention mechanism with a time-sequential mode similar to RNNs. Regretfully, the RWKV cannot afford to capture long-range dependencies over long sequences since the information would be lost in the sequential flow, in contrast to standard attentions Bahdanau et al. [2016]. In this paper, we propose the Retrospected Receptance Weighted Key Value (RRWKV) architecture based on RWKV for discharging long-range interactions and performing efficient information flow in which mediums are incorporated. Especially, the RRWKV model is to obtain the appropriate messages specifically addressing the issues of information redundancy that may occur with the attention mechanisms and information loss with the RWKV. ## 2 Background\n\nIn this section, we will briefly introduce the development history of RWKV from the standard transformer architectures and then analyse the reasons of lacking long-range dependencies in RWKV. On the one hand, we discuss dot-product\n\n[^0]attention and tensor-product attention in standard transformer architectures. On the other hand, we uncover the underlying ideas of two blocks in RWKV and the deficiencies they bring. ### 2.1 Standard Transformer Architecture\n\nHere we simply review the core components of Transformers, attention mechanisms. Attention mechanisms leverage query, key, and value components to facilitate information selection. The query encapsulates the context of a specific matter, while the keys and values correspond to the input elements. By evaluating compatibility between the query and each key, attention weights are assigned to the corresponding values. These weighted values are then summed, enabling the matter to incorporate pertinent information from values. ### 2.1.1 Dot-Product Attention\n\nIn dot-product attention Vaswani et al. [2017], attention weights are determined by taking the dot product between the query and key vectors. The dot-product serves as a measure of similarity and represents the compatibility between the query and key. Mathematically, for a given sequence of tokens, the dot-product attention can be expressed as follows:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Atten}(Q, K, V)_{t}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\exp \\left(q_{t}^{T} k_{i}\\right) \\cdot v_{i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\exp \\left(q_{t}^{T} k_{i}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere $q$ represents the query vector, $k$ represents the key vector, $v$ represents the value vector, and scaling factor is neglected for convenience. Dot-product attention effectively implements the core idea of attention mechanisms and allows for parallel computation at each time step. However, it is constrained by the quadratic calculation and storage requirements of the similarity matrix, limiting its capabilities. ### 2.1.2 Tensor-Product Attention\n\nIn tensor-product attention Zhai et al. [2021], the determination of attention weights is based on the key vectors and position biases, replacing the conventional use of key and query vectors Bahdanau et al. [2016], Vaswani et al. [2017]. The tensor-product performs the role of feature interaction between the query and the weighted sum value. Correspondingly, the tensor-product attention can be expressed as follows:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Atten}(Q, K, V)_{t}=\\sigma\\left(q_{t}\\right) \\odot \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\exp \\left(k_{i}+w_{t, i}\\right) \\odot v_{i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\exp \\left(k_{i}+w_{t, i}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere each $w_{t, i}$ is a learned scalar which introduces an offset in the key vector $i$. This implies that key vectors can be adjusted to be more suitable for the specific query at time $t$. Although the tensor-product attention still retains the same high computational costs as the dot-product attention, it can be transformed into a linear complexity operation by disregarding the position biases. ### 2.2 Receptance Weighted Key Value Architecture\n\nHere we briefly analyse the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture which combines the sequential mode of RNNs and then achieves the linear calculation and storage costs.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 3. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 59/74 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n- RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT (attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)), another variant of linear attention. Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs. We also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer's MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP blocks. ## B. 3 Relationship to RNNs\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state. Several older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n- They do not use state expansion $(N=1)$ or selective $B, C$ parameters, both of which are important for performance (Section 4.6). - They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism + discretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and initializations (Section 3.6). Additionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991; Hochreiter, Bengio, et al. 2001; Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The former could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the latter was difficult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Introduction\n\nThe Transformer architecture has achieved widespread adoption, particularly in the domain of large language models\n\n[^0]Preliminary work., Copyright 2024 by the author(s). (LLM) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Peng et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b) and multi-modal models (Li et al., 2022; 2023a; Liu et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b; Lu et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023a; Hao et al., 2024). However, its computational complexity grows quadratically with the length of the input sequence, making it challenging to model extremely long sequences. Unlimited sequence length stands out as a noteworthy aspect within the realm of LLM, attracting considerable attention from researchers who seek intelligent solutions. The potential applications of LLM with unlimited sequence length are diverse, encompassing extended conversations in various professional domains and handling a vast number of tokens in multimodal modeling tasks. In response to the quadratic complexity challenge, a promising resolution emerges in the form of linear attention. This method involves the elimination of the softmax operation and capitalizes on the associativity property of matrix products. Consequently, it significantly accelerates both training and inference procedures. To elaborate, linear attention reduces the computational complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) to compute the attention matrices, where $n$ represents the sequence length. This avenue holds substantial promise for augmenting the efficiency of transformer-style models across a broad spectrum of applications. It is important to note that the notable reduction in complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ in linear attention is only theoretical and may not directly translate to a proportional improvement in computational efficiency on hardware in practice. The realization of practical wall-clock speedup faces challenges, primarily stemming from two issues: 1). the dominance of memory access (I/O) on the GPU could impact the overall computation speed of attention. 2). the cumulative summation (cumsum) needed by the linear attention kernel trick prevents it from reaching its theoretical training speed in the causal setting. The first issue has been successfully addressed by Lightning Attention-1 (Qin et al., 2023b). In this paper, we introduce\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ae38c698417dafba3079g-02.jpg?height=521&width=1709&top_left_y=213&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 1. Speed Showdown: FlashAttention vs. Lightning Attention in Expanding Sequence Lengths and Model Sizes. The diagram above provides a comparative illustration of training speed, Token per GPU per Second (TGS) for LLaMA with FlashAttention-2, TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-1 and TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-2, implemented across three model sizes: 400M, 1B, and 3B from left to right. It is strikingly evident that Lightning Attention-2 manifests a consistent training speed irrespective of the increasing sequence length. Conversely, the other methods significantly decline training speed as the sequence length expands. Lightning Attention-2 to solve the second issue. The key idea is to leverage the concept of \"divide and conquer\" by separately handling the intra block and inter block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, for the intra blocks, we maintain the use of conventional attention computation mechanism to compute the product of QKV, while for the inter blocks, we employ the linear attention kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b). Tiling techniques are implemented in both forward and backward procedures to fully leverage GPU hardware capabilities. As a result, the Lightning Attention-2 can train LLMs with unlimited sequence length without extra cost ${ }^{1}$, as its computational speed remains constant with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of Lightning Attention-2 across a diverse range of sequence lengths to assess its accuracy and compare its computational speed and memory utilization with FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) and Lightning Attention-1. The findings indicate that Lightning Attention-2 exhibits a notable advantage in computational speed, attributed to its innovative intra-inter separation strategy. Additionally, Lightning Attention-2 demonstrates a reduced memory footprint compared to its counterparts without compromising performance. ## 2. Related Work\n\n### 2.1.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models.

Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model for Realistic Image Deblurring\n\n*From Search Query: RWKV integration*\n\n*Zheng Chen, Yulun Zhang, Ding Liu, Bin Xia, Jinjin Gu, L. Kong, X. Yuan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff) is proposed, which designs the hierarchical integration module to fuse the prior into the regression-based model from multiple scales, enabling better generalization in complex blurry scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** Diffusion models (DMs) have recently been introduced in image deblurring and exhibited promising performance, particularly in terms of details reconstruction. However, the diffusion model requires a large number of inference iterations to recover the clean image from pure Gaussian noise, which consumes massive computational resources. Moreover, the distribution synthesized by the diffusion model is often misaligned with the target results, leading to restrictions in distortion-based metrics. To address the above issues, we propose the Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff), for realistic image deblurring. Specifically, we perform the DM in a highly compacted latent space to generate the prior feature for the deblurring process. The deblurring process is implemented by a regression-based method to obtain better distortion accuracy. Meanwhile, the highly compact latent space ensures the efficiency of the DM. Furthermore, we design the hierarchical integration module to fuse the prior into the regression-based model from multiple scales, enabling better generalization in complex blurry scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world blur datasets demonstrate that our HI-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Prior generative approaches which decode slot values sequentially do not generalize well to variations in schema, while discriminative approaches separately encode history and schema and fail to account for inter-slot and intent-slot dependencies. We introduce SPLAT, a novel architecture which achieves better generalization and efficiency than prior approaches by constraining outputs to a limited prediction space. At the same time, our model allows for rich attention among descriptions and history while keeping computation costs constrained by incorporating linear-time attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and MultiWOZ datasets. Our approach significantly improves upon existing models achieving 85.3 JGA on the SGD dataset. Further, we show increased robustness on the SGD-X benchmark: our model outperforms the more than 30x larger D3ST-XXL model by 5.0 points.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.

Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

This paper introduces Gated Slot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control (ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via softmax, utilizing context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity while maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances both training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient training algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the softmax operation is particularly beneficial in \"finetuning pretrained Transformers to RNNs\" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch.

LION: Linear Group RNN for 3D Object Detection in Point Clouds\n\n*From Search Query: RWKV integration*\n\n*Xiang Bai, Hengshuang Zhao, Jingdong Wang, Xiaoqing Ye, Xinyu Wang, Jinghua Hou, Zhe Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** The benefit of transformers in large-scale 3D point cloud perception tasks, such as 3D object detection, is limited by their quadratic computation cost when modeling long-range relationships. In contrast, linear RNNs have low computational complexity and are suitable for long-range modeling. Toward this goal, we propose a simple and effective window-based framework built on LInear grOup RNN (i.e., perform linear RNN for grouped features) for accurate 3D object detection, called LION. The key property is to allow sufficient feature interaction in a much larger group than transformer-based methods. However, effectively applying linear group RNN to 3D object detection in highly sparse point clouds is not trivial due to its limitation in handling spatial modeling. To tackle this problem, we simply introduce a 3D spatial feature descriptor and integrate it into the linear group RNN operators to enhance their spatial features rather than blindly increasing the number of scanning orders for voxel features. To further address the challenge in highly sparse point clouds, we propose a 3D voxel generation strategy to densify foreground features thanks to linear group RNN as a natural property of auto-regressive models. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed components and the generalization of our LION on different linear group RNN operators including Mamba, RWKV, and RetNet. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that our LION-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art on Waymo, nuScenes, Argoverse V2, and ONCE dataset. Last but not least, our method supports kinds of advanced linear RNN operators (e.g., RetNet, RWKV, Mamba, xLSTM and TTT) on small but popular KITTI dataset for a quick experience with our linear RNN-based framework.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-25\n\n\n\n#### 4. Efficient Attention: Attention with Linear Complexities\n\n*From Search Query: Linear Attention Efficiency*\n\n*Shuai Yi, Haiyu Zhao, Hongsheng Li, Zhuoran Shen, Mingyuan Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Dot-product attention has wide applications in computer vision and natural language processing. However, its memory and computational costs grow quadratically with the input size. Such growth prohibits its application on high-resolution inputs. To remedy this drawback, this paper proposes a novel efficient attention mechanism equivalent to dot-product attention but with substantially less memory and computational costs. Its resource efficiency allows more widespread and flexible integration of attention modules into a network, which leads to better accuracies. Empirical evaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of its advantages. Efficient attention modules brought significant performance boosts to object detectors and instance segmenters on MS-COCO 2017.

These mechanisms maintain consistent training speed across sequence lengths and are optimized for hardware efficiency, which is crucial for handling long sequences effectively[5,.\n\n## Integration with RWKV Architecture\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: Combining GLA with the RWKV (Recursive Weighted Kernels and Vectors) architecture can leverage the strengths of both approaches. RWKV models, like those mentioned in the Falcon Mamba paper, have shown competitive performance with Transformer-based models while offering different architectural advantages. Integrating GLA into RWKV could enhance the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies efficiently.\n\n## Test-Time Training Capabilities\n- **Adaptability and Robustness**: Test-time training with self-supervision, as discussed in \"Test-Time Training with Self-Supervision,\" allows models to adapt during inference, improving robustness to distribution shifts. This capability is essential for maintaining the model's performance in dynamic or unseen environments. Integrating this with GLA and RWKV can ensure the model remains adaptable and robust[5,.\n\n## Technical Implementation Details\n- **Gated Linear Attention**: GLA can be implemented to enhance the efficiency of linear attention mechanisms. For example, the AGaLiTe model introduces approximate gated linear transformers, which could be adapted for autoregressive decoding. This approach can help in reducing the computational complexity associated with traditional self-attention mechanisms.\n- **RWKV Training Strategies**: The Falcon Mamba paper provides insights into training strategies for RWKV models, including batch size rampup, learning rate schedules, and data mixtures. These strategies can be adapted and combined with GLA to optimize the training process for the hybrid model.\n\n## Future Research Directions\n- **Implementation Details**: Further research should focus on the specific implementation details of integrating GLA with RWKV. This includes how to effectively combine the gated linear attention mechanism with the recursive weighted kernels and vectors of the RWKV architecture.\n- **Optimization Techniques**: Exploring optimization techniques such as those mentioned in the PhiMoE model, like grouped query attention and efficient use of embedding tables, can help in reducing memory requirements and inference costs. These optimizations can be crucial for maintaining efficiency in the hybrid model.\n\nBy combining these insights, the researchers can develop a novel autoregressive language model that leverages the efficiency of linear attention mechanisms, the adaptability of test-time training, and the architectural advantages of RWKV, ultimately enhancing the model's performance, scalability, and robustness.\n",

While self-attention mechanisms excel at modeling long-range dependencies, they often come with high computational costs, especially for long sequences. Convolutional layers provide a computationally efficient alternative for modeling local dependencies but typically use fixed kernels, limiting their adaptability to varying contexts.\n\nThe **Conv** GAU in our seed design employs standard convolutional layers, which may not fully exploit the potential of convolutional mechanisms in capturing local patterns adaptively. By integrating **dynamic convolutions** (which adapt convolutional kernels based on input) and **gated convolutions** (which control information flow through gating mechanisms), we aim to enhance the Conv GAU's capability to model local contexts more effectively while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n## Related Work\n\n1. **Dynamic Convolution**:\n   - *Wu et al. (2019)* introduced dynamic convolution, where the convolutional kernels are dynamically generated based on the input at each time step, allowing the model to adapt to varying contexts.\n   - *Zhou et al. (2020)* successfully integrated dynamic convolution into the BERT architecture with ConvBERT, achieving performance improvements with reduced training costs.\n\n2. **Gated Convolutional Networks**:\n   - *Dauphin et al. (2017)* proposed Gated Linear Units (GLUs) in convolutional networks for language modeling, demonstrating improved performance over traditional activation functions like ReLU.\n   - GLUs allow the model to control information flow dynamically, enhancing representational capacity.\n\n3. **Hybrid Models**:\n   - *De et al. (2024)* presented Griffin, a model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention, showing the effectiveness of gating mechanisms in efficient language modeling.\n   - These works highlight the benefits of integrating gating and dynamic mechanisms to improve adaptability and efficiency.\n\nThese studies inform our design by demonstrating that dynamic and gated convolutions can enhance the expressiveness and efficiency of convolutional layers in language models.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Challenges with the Current Conv GAU\n\n1. **Limited Adaptability**: Fixed convolutional kernels may not adapt well to varying input contexts, limiting the model's ability to capture diverse local patterns.\n\n2. **Lack of Information Flow Control**: Without gating mechanisms, the convolutional layers cannot dynamically regulate the information passing through them, potentially leading to suboptimal performance.\n\n3. **Balancing Efficiency and Expressiveness**: Enhancing the convolutional layers must be done without significantly increasing computational complexity to maintain practical efficiency.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nIntegrate dynamic and gated convolutional mechanisms into the **Conv** GAU to:\n\n- **Increase Adaptability**: Allow convolutional kernels to be dynamically generated based on the input, enabling the model to adapt to different contexts and capture diverse patterns.\n\n- **Enhance Information Flow Control**: Incorporate gating mechanisms to dynamically control the flow of information through the convolutional layers, improving representational capacity.\n\n- **Maintain Computational Efficiency**: Design the modifications to be computationally efficient, ensuring that the overall model remains practical for training and inference.\n\n### Theoretical Justification\n\n1. **Dynamic Convolutions**:\n   - **Adaptive Kernels**: By generating convolutional kernels conditioned on the input, the model can capture varying local patterns more effectively.\n   - **Mathematical Formulation**:\n     - Let \\( X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B \\times L \\times D} \\) be the input tensor.\n     - **Kernel Generation**:\n       \\[\n       W_t = \\text{softmax}(X_t W_{\\text{gen}} + b_{\\text{gen}})\n       \\]\n       where \\( W_{\\text{gen}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D \\times K} \\) and \\( b_{\\text{gen}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K} \\) are learnable parameters, \\( K \\) is kernel size, and \\( t \\) indexes the sequence length \\( L \\).\n     - **Dynamic Convolution**:\n       \\[\n       Y_t = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} W_{t, k} \\cdot X_{t + k - \\lceil K/2 \\rceil}\n       \\]\n       where \\( Y_t \\) is the output at position \\( t \\).\n\n2. **Gated Convolutions**:\n   - **Information Control**: Gating mechanisms allow the model to control the information flow dynamically, enhancing the model's capacity to represent complex patterns.\n   - **Mathematical Formulation**:\n     - **Gated Linear Units (GLUs)**:\n       \\[\n       Y = (X * W) \\odot \\sigma(X * V + b)\n       \\]\n       where \\( * \\) denotes convolution, \\( \\odot \\) is element-wise multiplication, \\( W, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D \\times D} \\) are convolutional weights, \\( b \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D} \\) is bias, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the sigmoid activation function.\n\n3. **Combined Effect**:\n   - The integration of dynamic convolutions with GLUs results in a convolutional layer that is both adaptable and capable of dynamic information flow control.\n   - This enhances the model's ability to capture complex and varying local patterns efficiently.\n\n### Potential Trade-offs and Mitigation\n\n- **Computational Overhead**:\n  - **Challenge**: Kernel generation and gating introduce additional computations.\n  - **Mitigation**: Use lightweight networks for kernel generation and efficient tensor operations to minimize overhead.\n\n- **Implementation Complexity**:\n  - **Challenge**: Increased architectural complexity may complicate implementation.\n  - **Mitigation**: Integrate modifications within the existing GAU framework and leverage existing libraries for efficient implementation.\n\n- **Training Stability**:\n  - **Challenge**: Dynamic mechanisms may affect training convergence.\n  - **Mitigation**: Employ proper initialization, regularization techniques, and learning rate schedules to ensure stable training.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection Conv```\n\n### Modifications and New Structures\n\n1. **Dynamic Convolution Integration**:\n   -
