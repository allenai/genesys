We introduce a method to reduce this to linear scaling with time, based on defining attention via latent vectors. The method is readily usable as a drop-in replacement for the standard attention mechanism. Our\"Latte Transformer\"model can be implemented for both bidirectional and unidirectional tasks, with the causal version allowing a recurrent implementation which is memory and time-efficient during inference of language generation tasks. Whilst next token prediction scales linearly with the sequence length for a standard transformer, a Latte Transformer requires constant time to compute the next token. The empirical performance of our method is comparable to standard attention, yet allows scaling to context windows much larger than practical in standard attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2112.05682, 2021.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 3. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Nystr\u00f6mformer: A nystr\u00f6m-based algorithm for approximating self-attention (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Yunyang Xiong, Zhanpeng Zeng, Rudrasis Chakraborty, Mingxing Tan, G. Fung, Yin Li, Vikas Singh*\n\n**Published in:** AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2021)\t**Cited by** 375  (*Influential: 62*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length and performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

Efficient Attention via Control Variates\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanism*\n\n*Lin Zheng, Jianbo Yuan, Chong Wang, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

Many studies pushed up the baseline to a higher level by modifying the architecture, augmenting data and designing new losses. However, we find previous models still suffer from information fusion problem, although Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and Path Aggregation Network (PANet) have alleviated this. Therefore, this study provides an advanced Gatherand-Distribute mechanism (GD) mechanism, which is realized with convolution and self-attention operations. This new designed model named as Gold-YOLO, which boosts the multi-scale feature fusion capabilities and achieves an ideal balance between latency and accuracy across all model scales. Additionally, we implement MAE-style pretraining in the YOLO-series for the first time, allowing YOLOseries models could be to benefit from unsupervised pretraining. Gold-YOLO-N attains an outstanding 39.9% AP on the COCO val2017 datasets and 1030 FPS on a T4 GPU, which outperforms the previous SOTA model YOLOv6-3.0-N with similar FPS by +2.4%.

Focus on the Core: Efficient Attention via Pruned Token Compression for Document Classification\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanism*\n\n*Jungmin Yun, Mihyeon Kim, Youngbin Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes integrating two strategies: token pruning and token combining, which not only improve the model's performance but also reduce its computational demands.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved dominant performance in numerous NLP tasks. Despite their remarkable successes, pre-trained transformers such as BERT suffer from a computationally expensive self-attention mechanism that interacts with all tokens, including the ones unfavorable to classification performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose integrating two strategies: token pruning and token combining. Token pruning eliminates less important tokens in the attention mechanism's key and value as they pass through the layers. Additionally, we adopt fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty and alleviate potential mispruning risks arising from an imbalanced distribution of each token's importance. Token combining, on the other hand, condenses input sequences into smaller sizes in order to further compress the model. By integrating these two approaches, we not only improve the model's performance but also reduce its computational demands. Experiments with various datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline models, especially with the best improvement over the existing BERT model, achieving +5%p in accuracy and +5.6%p in F1 score. Additionally, memory cost is reduced to 0.61x, and a speedup of 1.64x is achieved.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Transformers are RNNs: Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Angelos Katharopoulos, Apoorv Vyas, Nikolaos Pappas, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work expresses the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and makes use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from O(N) to N, where N is the sequence length.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers achieve remarkable performance in several tasks but due to their quadratic complexity, with respect to the input's length, they are prohibitively slow for very long sequences. To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^2\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 1334  (*Influential: 177*)\n\n#### 5.

Sra*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results obtained in this paper suggest that a simple linearized Transformer model could actually be a valuable, realistic abstraction for understanding Transformer optimization.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer training is notoriously difficult, requiring a careful design of optimizers and use of various heuristics. We make progress towards understanding the subtleties of training Transformers by carefully studying a simple yet canonical linearized shallow Transformer model. Specifically, we train linear Transformers to solve regression tasks, inspired by J.~von Oswald et al.~(ICML 2023), and K.~Ahn et al.~(NeurIPS 2023). Most importantly, we observe that our proposed linearized models can reproduce several prominent aspects of Transformer training dynamics.

Structured State Space Models for In-Context Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: state space models*\n\n*Chris Xiaoxuan Lu, Yannick Schroecker, Albert Gu, Emilio Parisotto, J. Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

State-space Models with Layer-wise Nonlinearity are Universal Approximators with Exponential Decaying Memory\n\n*From Search Query: state space models*\n\n*Shida Wang, Beichen Xue*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models have gained popularity in sequence modelling due to their simple and efficient network structures. However, the absence of nonlinear activation along the temporal direction limits the model's capacity. In this paper, we prove that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship. Our findings demonstrate that the addition of layer-wise nonlinear activation enhances the model's capacity to learn complex sequence patterns. Meanwhile, it can be seen both theoretically and empirically that the state-space models do not fundamentally resolve the issue of exponential decaying memory. Theoretical results are justified by numerical verifications.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 8. On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: state space models*\n\n*Albert Gu, Ankit Gupta, Karan Goel, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically describes various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and performs a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 209  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. LSTM-based Deep Learning Models for Non-factoid Answer Selection\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanism*\n\n*Ming Tan, Cicero dos Santos, Bing Xiang, Bowen Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we apply a general deep learning (DL) framework for the answer\nselection task, which does not depend on manually defined features or\nlinguistic tools. The basic framework is to build the embeddings of questions\nand answers based on bidirectional long short-term memory (biLSTM) models, and\nmeasure their closeness by cosine similarity. We further extend this basic\nmodel in two directions. One direction is to define a more composite\nrepresentation for questions and answers by combining convolutional neural\nnetwork with the basic framework. The other direction is to utilize a simple\nbut efficient attention mechanism in order to generate the answer\nrepresentation according to the question context. Several variations of models\nare provided. The models are examined by two datasets, including TREC-QA and\nInsuranceQA.

Efficient Transformer Knowledge Distillation: A Performance Review\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanism*\n\n*Nathan Brown, Ashton Williamson, Tahj Anderson, Logan Lawrence*\n\n**Abstract:** As pretrained transformer language models continue to achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance, the Natural Language Processing community has\npushed for advances in model compression and efficient attention mechanisms to\naddress high computational requirements and limited input sequence length.\nDespite these separate efforts, no investigation has been done into the\nintersection of these two fields. In this work, we provide an evaluation of\nmodel compression via knowledge distillation on efficient attention\ntransformers. We provide cost-performance trade-offs for the compression of\nstate-of-the-art efficient attention architectures and the gains made in\nperformance in comparison to their full attention counterparts. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a new long-context Named Entity Recognition dataset, GONERD, to train\nand test the performance of NER models on long sequences. We find that\ndistilled efficient attention transformers can preserve a significant amount of\noriginal model performance, preserving up to 98.6% across short-context tasks\n(GLUE, SQUAD, CoNLL-2003), up to 94.6% across long-context\nQuestion-and-Answering tasks (HotpotQA, TriviaQA), and up to 98.8% on\nlong-context Named Entity Recognition (GONERD), while decreasing inference\ntimes by up to 57.8%. We find that, for most models on most tasks, performing\nknowledge distillation is an effective method to yield high-performing\nefficient attention models with low costs.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-22T19:19:37Z  (*Updated: 2023-11-22T19:19:37Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax\n  Mimicry\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency,\nreducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also\nenables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear\nattention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText-103 for\n125M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into\na viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B\nachieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model,\nwhere prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z  (*Updated: 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5.

With a computational\ncomplexity of $O(L \\log L)$, this architecture can handle significantly longer\nsequences than state-of-the-art models that are based on sparse attention\npatterns. We evaluate our model on a series of long document abstractive\nsummarization tasks. The model reaches a performance level that is 93-96%\ncomparable to the top-performing sparse transformers of the same size while\nsaving up to 50% memory during training and up to 87% during inference.\nAdditionally, LOCOST effectively handles input texts exceeding 600K tokens at\ninference time, setting new state-of-the-art results on full-book summarization\nand opening new perspectives for long input processing.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-31T15:33:37Z  (*Updated: 2024-03-25T12:52:42Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Mimetic Initialization Helps State Space Models Learn to Recall\n\n*From Search Query: state space models*\n\n*Asher Trockman, Hrayr Harutyunyan, J. Zico Kolter, Sanjiv Kumar, Srinadh Bhojanapalli*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that state space models such as Mamba are significantly\nworse than Transformers on recall-based tasks due to the fact that their state\nsize is constant with respect to their input sequence length. But in practice,\nstate space models have fairly large state sizes, and we conjecture that they\nshould be able to perform much better at these tasks than previously reported.\nWe investigate whether their poor copying and recall performance could be due\nin part to training difficulties rather than fundamental capacity constraints.\nBased on observations of their \"attention\" maps, we propose a structured\ninitialization technique that allows state space layers to more readily mimic\nattention. Across a variety of architecture settings, our initialization makes\nit substantially easier for Mamba to learn to copy and do associative recall\nfrom scratch.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-14T23:17:46Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-14T23:17:46Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

BAM: A Balanced Attention Mechanism for Single Image Super Resolution\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanism*\n\n*Cheng Shen, Haotian Hu, Fanyi Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recovering texture information from the aliasing regions has always been a major challenge for Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) task. These regions are often submerged in noise so that we have to restore texture details while suppressing noise. To address this issue, we propose a Balanced Attention Mechanism (BAM), which consists of Avgpool Channel Attention Module (ACAM) and Maxpool Spatial Attention Module (MSAM) in parallel. ACAM is designed to suppress extreme noise in the large scale feature maps while MSAM preserves high-frequency texture details. Thanks to the parallel structure, these two modules not only conduct self-optimization, but also mutual optimization to obtain the balance of noise reduction and high-frequency texture restoration during the back propagation process, and the parallel structure makes the inference faster. To verify the effectiveness and robustness of BAM, we applied it to 10 SOTA SISR networks. The results demonstrate that BAM can efficiently improve the networks performance, and for those originally with attention mechanism, the substitution with BAM further reduces the amount of parameters and increases the inference speed. Moreover, we present a dataset with rich texture aliasing regions in real scenes, named realSR7. Experiments prove that BAM achieves better super-resolution results on the aliasing area.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-15\n\n\n\n#### 3. Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Mike Lewis, Noah A. Smith, Ofir Press*\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n**Conference:** train-short-test-long-attention-with-linear-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-08-27\n\n\n\n#### 4. Linformer: Self-Attention with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Madian Khabsa, Hao Ma, Sinong Wang, Belinda Z. Li, Han Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textit{Linformer}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 5. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: state space models*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 6. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\n*From Search Query: state space models*\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-31\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, focusing on efficient attention mechanisms, linear attention variants, and state space models, here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Streaming Attention\nThe concept of \"StreamingLLM\" introduced in the work by Guangxuan Xiao is particularly relevant. This framework enables large language models to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without fine-tuning, addressing the memory and computational constraints associated with long sequences. By utilizing an attention sink mechanism, it significantly improves the efficiency and stability of language modeling, especially in streaming applications.\n\n### Linear Attention Variants\nLinear attention mechanisms can mitigate the quadratic complexity of traditional multi-head attention. For instance, the \"Attention Is All You Need\" paper laid the groundwork for self-attention, but subsequent research has explored more efficient variants. Linear attention mechanisms, such as those using kernel methods or state space models, can reduce the computational complexity to O(N), making them more scalable.\n\n### Analog In-Memory Computing\nThe use of analog in-memory computing for self-attention, as proposed in the arXiv paper, offers a promising approach to reduce latency and energy consumption. This method implements sliding window attention using gain cell memories, which can efficiently store and compute token projections, leading to significant improvements in computational efficiency.\n\n## State Space Models\n\n### Diagonal State Space Models\nState space models, particularly diagonal state space models (S4D), have been shown to offer an efficient alternative to traditional attention mechanisms. These models have linear complexity and can perform comparably to more complex models. Integrating such models into the architecture could provide a more efficient way to handle long-range dependencies.\n\n## Hybrid Architectures and Adaptive Computation\n\n### Combining Attention and State Space Models\nHybrid architectures that combine the strengths of attention mechanisms and state space models could be highly beneficial. For example, using state space models to handle long-range dependencies and attention for local context could leverage the benefits of both approaches.\n\n### Adaptive Routing Mechanisms\nAdaptive routing mechanisms, such as those proposed in the \"Neural Data Router\" work, can improve model efficiency and interpretability. These mechanisms allow for dynamic control flow, which can reduce unnecessary processing and adapt to different types of inputs.\n\n### Hierarchical Processing\nHierarchical processing in transformers can better handle different types of dependencies. This approach can be combined with state space models and efficient attention mechanisms to create a more scalable and efficient architecture.\n\n## Key Insights and Future Directions\n\n- **Replace or Augment MHA**: Consider replacing or augmenting the multi-head attention mechanism with more efficient linear attention variants or state space models.\n- **Adaptive Computation Paths**: Implement adaptive computation paths to reduce unnecessary processing and improve efficiency.\n- **Hierarchical Processing**: Introduce hierarchical processing to better handle different types of dependencies.\n- **Different Mathematical Spaces**: Explore operating in different mathematical spaces, such as logit simplex space, for potential computational benefits.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models that outperform current state-of-the-art models in terms of perplexity, accuracy, and computational efficiency.\n",

SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 4.

This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models. ## 1 Introduction\n\nFoundation models serve as the backbone for a wide range of tasks across Artificial Intelligence due to their ability to learn complex interactions in large datasets [Bommasani et al., 2021]. In recent years, the attention mechanism [Vaswani et al. 2017] has been the dominating token-mixing strategy in foundation models. However, its major computational bottleneck, i.e., the quadratic complexity with context length, has posed a challenge to scaling and deploying these models beyond moderate context lengths [Tay et al. 2021]. In order to mitigate these issues, attention-free architectures have been proposed: prominent examples of these are the novel State Space Models (SSMs) Gu et al., 2022b, Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023, Gu and Dao, 2023, Dao and Gu, 2024, as well as recent\n\n[^0]efforts to enhance Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Stani\u0107 et al., 2023, De et al., 2024, Qin et al., 2024, Beck et al., 2024]. Although these models show great promise in boosting efficiency, current comparisons with attention are merely empirical. Despite the prevalence and ubiquity of foundation models, a principled understanding of the similarities and differences among these different design strategies is currently lacking. In order to close this gap, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), a theoretical framework that allows to evaluate the similarities and differences between different foundation models in a principled manner. This framework spans most current architectures and allows for direct comparisons, theoretical and computational, across attention, SSMs, and RNNs. The DSF provides new insights on the most relevant features found in current architectures, and can inform a systematic development of future hybrid models. Specifically, in this paper we answer the following questions:\n\n## - How are attention, SSMs, and RNNs related? $T L ; D R$ : All three model classes can be represented as recurrent models that can directly be compared using the proposed DSF. - Can softmax attention be expressed as a recurrent model? $T L ; D R$ : Softmax attention translates to a recurrent model within the DSF, however the hidden state dimension needs to be infinite. - Why does state expansion help to improve performance of RNNs and SSMs? $T L ; D R$ : This is related to the second question: state expansion increases the dimension of the hidden state thus allowing for an increased expressivity of the model (Lemma 2). - How closely are linear attention and S6 (i.e. Mamba) related? $T L ; D R$ : The common feature is the coupling of state transition and input matrix via a single (normalization) parameter in recurrent representation. However, the two models differ in the parameterization of this parameter, which we analyze experimentally. - What do selective SSMs teach us about improving RNN architectures? $T L ; D R$ : Replacing the state transition in a RNN variant - qLSTM - with the state transition of S6 improves performance of the RNN. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that, for the models studied here, some model classes are natively stated in recurrent form (i.e. SSMs, RNNs), while others are stated in convolutional (matrix) form (i.e. attention). The DSF allows to switch between these model classes and leverage computational tools developed for other classes. For instance, the recurrent form is efficiently implemented via scan algorithms [Blelloch, 1990], e.g., selective scan [Gu and Dao, 2023], parallel scan [Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023], and accelerated scan [Kyrylov, 2024]. The same holds for the convolutional form via, e.g., flash attention [Dao, 2023], flash linear attention [Yang and Zhang, 2024], and structured masked attention [Dao and Gu, 2024]. Given that the structural requirements on the model parameterization of the algorithm is met, the DSF allows to identify existing algorithms to apply to a new model even if the algorithm was designed for another model class. Notation: We use Latin letters in the following way: $N$ is the size of the hidden state in the DSF, $n$ the state expansion, $d$ the embedding size or model size, and $L$ the sequence length.\n```\n\n#### 5. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg.

Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2.

The subsidiary content-based SDU gates allow for the information flow of modulated latent embeddings through skipped connections, leading to a clear margin of convergence speed with gradient descent algorithms. We may unveil the role of gating mechanism to aid in the context-based Transformer modules, with hypothesizing that SDU gates, especially on shallow layers, could push it faster to step towards suboptimal points during the optimization process.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis with Gated Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: gating mechanisms attention*\n\n*Wei Xue, Tao Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A model based on convolutional neural networks and gating mechanisms, which is more accurate and efficient, and the novel Gated Tanh-ReLU Units can selectively output the sentiment features according to the given aspect or entity.\n\n**Abstract:** Aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA) can provide more detailed information than general sentiment analysis, because it aims to predict the sentiment polarities of the given aspects or entities in text. We summarize previous approaches into two subtasks: aspect-category sentiment analysis (ACSA) and aspect-term sentiment analysis (ATSA). Most previous approaches employ long short-term memory and attention mechanisms to predict the sentiment polarity of the concerned targets, which are often complicated and need more training time. We propose a model based on convolutional neural networks and gating mechanisms, which is more accurate and efficient. First, the novel Gated Tanh-ReLU Units can selectively output the sentiment features according to the given aspect or entity. The architecture is much simpler than attention layer used in the existing models. Second, the computations of our model could be easily parallelized during training, because convolutional layers do not have time dependency as in LSTM layers, and gating units also work independently. The experiments on SemEval datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 511  (*Influential: 63*)\n\n#### 4.

Zaharia*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes PipeDream-2BW, a system that performs memory-efficient pipeline parallelism, a hybrid form of parallelism that combines data and model parallelism with input pipelining, able to accelerate the training of large language models with up to 2.5 billion parameters by up to 6.9x compared to optimized baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Many state-of-the-art results in domains such as NLP and computer vision have been obtained by scaling up the number of parameters in existing models. However, the weight parameters and intermediate outputs of these large models often do not fit in the main memory of a single accelerator device; this means that it is necessary to use multiple accelerators to train large models, which is challenging to do in a time-efficient way. In this work, we propose PipeDream-2BW, a system that performs memory-efficient pipeline parallelism, a hybrid form of parallelism that combines data and model parallelism with input pipelining. Our system uses a novel pipelining and weight gradient coalescing strategy, combined with the double buffering of weights, to ensure high throughput, low memory footprint, and weight update semantics similar to data parallelism. In addition, PipeDream-2BW automatically partitions the model over the available hardware resources, while being cognizant of constraints such as compute capabilities, memory capacities, and interconnect topologies, and determines when to employ existing memory-savings techniques, such as activation recomputation, that trade off extra computation for lower memory footprint. PipeDream-2BW is able to accelerate the training of large language models with up to 2.5 billion parameters by up to 6.9x compared to optimized baselines.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 168  (*Influential: 33*)\n\n#### 5. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient hybrid models*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

We present a new PEFT method called Robust Adaptation (RoSA) inspired by robust principal component analysis that jointly trains $\\textit{low-rank}$ and $\\textit{highly-sparse}$ components on top of a set of fixed pretrained weights to efficiently approximate the performance of a full-fine-tuning (FFT) solution. Across a series of challenging generative tasks such as grade-school math and SQL query generation, which require fine-tuning for good performance, we show that RoSA outperforms LoRA, pure sparse fine-tuning, and alternative hybrid methods at the same parameter budget, and can even recover the performance of FFT on some tasks. We provide system support for RoSA to complement the training algorithm, specifically in the form of sparse GPU kernels which enable memory- and computationally-efficient training, and show that it is also compatible with low-precision base weights, resulting in the first joint representation combining quantization, low-rank and sparse approximations.

To address this, many studies explore parameter-efficient tuning methods, also framed as \u201cdelta tuning\u201d in Ding et al. (2022), which updates only a small subset of parameters, known as \u201cdelta modules\u201d, while keeping the backbone model\u2019s parameters fixed. However, the practicality and flexibility of delta tuning have been limited due to existing implementations that directly modify the code of the backbone PTMs and hard-code specific delta tuning methods for each PTM. In this paper, we present OpenDelta, an open-source library that overcomes these limitations by providing a plug-and-play implementation of various delta tuning methods. Our novel techniques eliminate the need to modify the backbone PTMs\u2019 code, making OpenDelta compatible with different, even novel PTMs. OpenDelta is designed to be simple, modular, and extensible, providing a comprehensive platform for researchers and practitioners to adapt large PTMs efficiently.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. CO2: Efficient Distributed Training with Full Communication-Computation Overlap\n\n*From Search Query: efficient implementation techniques*\n\n*Weigao Sun, Zhen Qin, Weixuan Sun, Shidi Li, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Yu Qiao, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new approach called CO2 that introduces local-updating and asynchronous communication to the distributed data-parallel training, thereby facilitating the full overlap of COmunication with COmputation and provides a mathematical proof of convergence, accompanied by the establishment of a stringent upper bound.\n\n**Abstract:** The fundamental success of large language models hinges upon the efficacious implementation of large-scale distributed training techniques. Nevertheless, building a vast, high-performance cluster featuring high-speed communication interconnectivity is prohibitively costly, and accessible only to prominent entities. In this work, we aim to lower this barrier and democratize large-scale training with limited bandwidth clusters. We propose a new approach called CO2 that introduces local-updating and asynchronous communication to the distributed data-parallel training, thereby facilitating the full overlap of COmunication with COmputation. CO2 is able to attain a high scalability even on extensive multi-node clusters constrained by very limited communication bandwidth. We further propose the staleness gap penalty and outer momentum clipping techniques together with CO2 to bolster its convergence and training stability. Besides, CO2 exhibits seamless integration with well-established ZeRO-series optimizers which mitigate memory consumption of model states with large model training. We also provide a mathematical proof of convergence, accompanied by the establishment of a stringent upper bound. Furthermore, we validate our findings through an extensive set of practical experiments encompassing a wide range of tasks in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. These experiments serve to demonstrate the capabilities of CO2 in terms of convergence, generalization, and scalability when deployed across configurations comprising up to 128 A100 GPUs. The outcomes emphasize the outstanding capacity of CO2 to hugely improve scalability, no matter on clusters with 800Gbps RDMA or 80Gbps TCP/IP inter-node connections.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. A Fast and Accurate Splitting Method for Optimal Transport: Analysis and Implementation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient implementation techniques*\n\n*Vien V. Mai, Jacob Lindb\u00e4ck, M. Johansson*\n\n**Abstract:** We develop a fast and reliable method for solving large-scale optimal transport (OT) problems at an unprecedented combination of speed and accuracy. Built on the celebrated Douglas-Rachford splitting technique, our method tackles the original OT problem directly instead of solving an approximate regularized problem, as many state-of-the-art techniques do. This allows us to provide sparse transport plans and avoid numerical issues of methods that use entropic regularization. The algorithm has the same cost per iteration as the popular Sinkhorn method, and each iteration can be executed efficiently, in parallel. The proposed method enjoys an iteration complexity $O(1/\\epsilon)$ compared to the best-known $O(1/\\epsilon^2)$ of the Sinkhorn method. In addition, we establish a linear convergence rate for our formulation of the OT problem. We detail an efficient GPU implementation of the proposed method that maintains a primal-dual stopping criterion at no extra cost. Substantial experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, both in terms of computation times and robustness.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Collective Event Detection via a Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: gating mechanisms attention*\n\n*Hang Yang, Yubo Chen, Yantao Jia, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Traditional approaches to the task of ACE event detection primarily regard multiple events in one sentence as independent ones and recognize them separately by using sentence-level information. However, events in one sentence are usually interdependent and sentence-level information is often insufficient to resolve ambiguities for some types of events. This paper proposes a novel framework dubbed as Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms (HBTNGMA) to solve the two problems simultaneously. Firstly, we propose a hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively. Then, we devise a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information. The experimental results on the widely used ACE 2005 dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Proceeding:** emnlp-2018-10\n\n**Published:** 2018-10-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. FastViT: A Fast Hybrid Vision Transformer using Structural Reparameterization\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient hybrid models*\n\n*Anurag Ranjan, Oncel Tuzel, Jeff Zhu, James Gabriel, Pavan Kumar Anasosalu Vasu*\n\n**Abstract:** The recent amalgamation of transformer and convolutional designs has led to steady improvements in accuracy and efficiency of the models. In this work, we introduce FastViT, a hybrid vision transformer architecture that obtains the state-of-the-art latency-accuracy trade-off. To this end, we introduce a novel token mixing operator, RepMixer, a building block of FastViT, that uses structural reparameterization to lower the memory access cost by removing skip-connections in the network. We further apply train-time overparametrization and large kernel convolutions to boost accuracy and empirically show that these choices have minimal effect on latency. We show that - our model is 3.5x faster than CMT, a recent state-of-the-art hybrid transformer architecture, 4.9x faster than EfficientNet, and 1.9x faster than ConvNeXt on a mobile device for the same accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. At similar latency, our model obtains 4.2% better Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet than MobileOne. Our model consistently outperforms competing architectures across several tasks -- image classification, detection, segmentation and 3D mesh regression with significant improvement in latency on both a mobile device and a desktop GPU. Furthermore, our model is highly robust to out-of-distribution samples and corruptions, improving over competing robust models.

Scaling Local Self-Attention for Parameter Efficient Visual Backbones\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient hybrid models*\n\n*Jonathon Shlens, Blake Hechtman, Niki Parmar, Aravind Srinivas, Prajit Ramachandran, Ashish Vaswani*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has the promise of improving computer vision systems due to parameter-independent scaling of receptive fields and content-dependent interactions, in contrast to parameter-dependent scaling and content-independent interactions of convolutions. Self-attention models have recently been shown to have encouraging improvements on accuracy-parameter trade-offs compared to baseline convolutional models such as ResNet-50. In this work, we aim to develop self-attention models that can outperform not just the canonical baseline models, but even the high-performing convolutional models. We propose two extensions to self-attention that, in conjunction with a more efficient implementation of self-attention, improve the speed, memory usage, and accuracy of these models. We leverage these improvements to develop a new self-attention model family, HaloNets, which reach state-of-the-art accuracies on the parameter-limited setting of the ImageNet classification benchmark. In preliminary transfer learning experiments, we find that HaloNet models outperform much larger models and have better inference performance. On harder tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation, our simple local self-attention and convolutional hybrids show improvements over very strong baselines. These results mark another step in demonstrating the efficacy of self-attention models on settings traditionally dominated by convolutional models.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-03-23\n\n\n\n#### 5.

A Novel 1D State Space for Efficient Music Rhythmic Analysis\n\n*From Search Query: efficient implementation techniques*\n\n*Zhiyao Duan, Andreas Ehmann, Matthew McCallum, Mojtaba Heydari*\n\n**Abstract:** Inferring music time structures has a broad range of applications in music production, processing and analysis. Scholars have proposed various methods to analyze different aspects of time structures, such as beat, downbeat, tempo and meter. Many state-of-the-art (SOFA) methods, however, are computationally expensive. This makes them inapplicable in real-world industrial settings where the scale of the music collections can be millions. This paper proposes a new state space and a semi-Markov model for music time structure analysis. The proposed approach turns the commonly used 2D state spaces into a 1D model through a jump-back reward strategy. It reduces the state spaces size drastically. We then utilize the proposed method for causal, joint beat, downbeat, tempo, and meter tracking, and compare it against several previous methods. The proposed method delivers similar performance with the SOFA joint causal models with a much smaller state space and a more than 30 times speedup.\n\n**Published:** 2021-11-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, focusing on efficient attention mechanisms, memory-efficient hybrid models, and implementation techniques is crucial. Here are some key findings and references that align with the researcher's goals:\n\n## Gating Mechanisms in Attention\n\n- The \"Hybrid Similarity and Difference Attention (HSDA)\" scheme described in employs a gating mechanism to combine similarity and difference attention. This approach allows the model to capture both global patterns and local variations, enhancing its adaptability to complex data. The gating mechanism dynamically adjusts the proportion of similarity and difference attention based on the input features, which is a key factor in improving the model's performance.\n\n- The concept of \"Gated Linear Attention\" mentioned in the analysis note highlights the use of data-dependent gates to improve the expressiveness of linear attention. This approach is competitive against standard Transformer architectures and can be integrated into hybrid models for better performance[Analysis Note].\n\n## Memory-Efficient Hybrid Models\n\n- The \"E-Tamba\" model discussed in is a hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of Transformer models with the memory efficiency of State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba. E-Tamba achieves significant memory savings (nearly 3X) compared to pure Transformer models while maintaining competitive performance in downstream NLP tasks and long-context retrieval. This model demonstrates a balanced solution between the superior long-context capabilities of Transformers and the memory efficiency of SSMs.\n\n- Other hybrid models like \"Jamba\" and \"Zamba\" mentioned in also explore the integration of attention and SSM layers, offering different strategies for optimizing memory efficiency and performance.\n\n## Efficient Implementation Techniques\n\n- The use of memristor-based in-memory computing for transformer self-attention, as described in, offers a highly efficient hardware implementation. This approach reduces power consumption and latency by integrating computation into memory, which is particularly beneficial for large-scale language models.\n\n- The concept of \"Lightning Attention-2\" and \"CHELA\" mentioned in the analysis note emphasizes the importance of tiling and hierarchical processing for efficient attention computation. These methods enable linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits, retaining consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length[Analysis Note].\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n- **Cross-Attention Fusion**: The \"Cross Attention Fusion Module\" described in combines local and global contextual features through a hierarchical fusion strategy. This approach maximizes the strengths of both CNN and Transformer branches, which could be adapted to improve the feature representation in hybrid language models.\n\n- **State Space Models**: The integration of SSMs with attention mechanisms, as seen in E-Tamba, highlights the potential of SSMs to handle long-range dependencies efficiently. This is particularly useful for tasks requiring long-context retrieval.\n\nBy incorporating these insights, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and performant autoregressive language models that leverage gating mechanisms, hybrid architectures, and advanced implementation techniques.\n",

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2. DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models (Avg.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3.

As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens. Our code, pretrained models, and hyperparameters are available in both Tensorflow and PyTorch.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/46 (Score: 0.70)*\n\n```\nOfir Press and Lior Wolf. 2016.

Universal Transformers  (Avg. Score: 0.55)\n\n*Mostafa Dehghani, Stephan Gouws, O. Vinyals, Jakob Uszkoreit, Lukasz Kaiser*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2018)\t**Cited by** 673  (*Influential: 65*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Universal Transformer (UT), a parallel-in-time self-attentive recurrent sequence model which can be cast as a generalization of the Transformer model and which addresses issues of parallelizability and global receptive field, is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) sequentially process data by updating their state with each new data point, and have long been the de facto choice for sequence modeling tasks. However, their inherently sequential computation makes them slow to train. Feed-forward and convolutional architectures have recently been shown to achieve superior results on some sequence modeling tasks such as machine translation, with the added advantage that they concurrently process all inputs in the sequence, leading to easy parallelization and faster training times. Despite these successes, however, popular feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer fail to generalize in many simple tasks that recurrent models handle with ease, e.g. copying strings or even simple logical inference when the string or formula lengths exceed those observed at training time. We propose the Universal Transformer (UT), a parallel-in-time self-attentive recurrent sequence model which can be cast as a generalization of the Transformer model and which addresses these issues. UTs combine the parallelizability and global receptive field of feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer with the recurrent inductive bias of RNNs. We also add a dynamic per-position halting mechanism and find that it improves accuracy on several tasks. In contrast to the standard Transformer, under certain assumptions, UTs can be shown to be Turing-complete. Our experiments show that UTs outperform standard Transformers on a wide range of algorithmic and language understanding tasks, including the challenging LAMBADA language modeling task where UTs achieve a new state of the art, and machine translation where UTs achieve a 0.9 BLEU improvement over Transformers on the WMT14 En-De dataset.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/32 (Score: 0.55)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1610.02357, 2016.

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/56 (Score: 0.40)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

This paper presents Larimar - a novel, brain-inspired architecture for enhancing LLMs with a distributed episodic memory. Larimar's memory allows for dynamic, one-shot updates of knowledge without the need for computationally expensive re-training or fine-tuning. Experimental results on multiple fact editing benchmarks demonstrate that Larimar attains accuracy comparable to most competitive baselines, even in the challenging sequential editing setup, but also excels in speed - yielding speed-ups of 8-10x depending on the base LLM - as well as flexibility due to the proposed architecture being simple, LLM-agnostic, and hence general. We further provide mechanisms for selective fact forgetting, information leakage prevention, and input context length generalization with Larimar and show their effectiveness.

Beyond Memorization: The Challenge of Random Memory Access in Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: selective mechanisms language models*\n\n*Tongyao Zhu, Qian Liu, Liang Pang, Zhengbao Jiang, Min-Yen Kan, Min Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that techniques including recitation and permutation improve the random memory access capability of LMs, and it is validated that enhancing random access by recitation leads to notable improvements in question answering.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent developments in Language Models (LMs) have shown their effectiveness in NLP tasks, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, the mechanisms underlying knowledge storage and memory access within their parameters remain elusive. In this paper, we investigate whether a generative LM (e.g., GPT-2) is able to access its memory sequentially or randomly. Through carefully-designed synthetic tasks, covering the scenarios of full recitation, selective recitation and grounded question answering, we reveal that LMs manage to sequentially access their memory while encountering challenges in randomly accessing memorized content. We find that techniques including recitation and permutation improve the random memory access capability of LMs. Furthermore, by applying this intervention to realistic scenarios of open-domain question answering, we validate that enhancing random access by recitation leads to notable improvements in question answering.

Do Charge Prediction Models Learn Legal Theory?\n\n*From Search Query: selective mechanisms language models*\n\n*Zhenwei An, Quzhe Huang, Cong Jiang, Yansong Feng, Dongyan Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is argued that trustworthy charge prediction models should take legal theories into consideration, and standing on prior studies in model interpretation, three principles for trustworthy models should follow in this task, which are sensitive, selective, and presumption of innocence.\n\n**Abstract:** The charge prediction task aims to predict the charge for a case given its fact description. Recent models have already achieved impressive accuracy in this task, however, little is understood about the mechanisms they use to perform the judgment.For practical applications, a charge prediction model should conform to the certain legal theory in civil law countries, as under the framework of civil law, all cases are judged according to certain local legal theories. In China, for example, nearly all criminal judges make decisions based on the Four Elements Theory (FET).In this paper, we argue that trustworthy charge prediction models should take legal theories into consideration, and standing on prior studies in model interpretation, we propose three principles for trustworthy models should follow in this task, which are sensitive, selective, and presumption of innocence.We further design a new framework to evaluate whether existing charge prediction models learn legal theories. Our findings indicate that, while existing charge prediction models meet the selective principle on a benchmark dataset, most of them are still not sensitive enough and do not satisfy the presumption of innocence.

Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Parameter Sharing\n\n*From Search Query: parameter sharing hybrid architectures*\n\n*Hieu Pham, M. Guan, Barret Zoph, Quoc V. Le, J. Dean*\n\n**TL;DR:** Efficient Neural Architecture Search is a fast and inexpensive approach for automatic model design that establishes a new state-of-the-art among all methods without post-training processing and delivers strong empirical performances using much fewer GPU-hours.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS), a fast and inexpensive approach for automatic model design. In ENAS, a controller learns to discover neural network architectures by searching for an optimal subgraph within a large computational graph. The controller is trained with policy gradient to select a subgraph that maximizes the expected reward on the validation set. Meanwhile the model corresponding to the selected subgraph is trained to minimize a canonical cross entropy loss. Thanks to parameter sharing between child models, ENAS is fast: it delivers strong empirical performances using much fewer GPU-hours than all existing automatic model design approaches, and notably, 1000x less expensive than standard Neural Architecture Search. On the Penn Treebank dataset, ENAS discovers a novel architecture that achieves a test perplexity of 55.8, establishing a new state-of-the-art among all methods without post-training processing. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, ENAS designs novel architectures that achieve a test error of 2.89%, which is on par with NASNet (Zoph et al., 2018), whose test error is 2.65%.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 2620  (*Influential: 481*)\n\n#### 5. In defense of parameter sharing for model-compression\n\n*From Search Query: parameter sharing hybrid architectures*\n\n*Aditya Desai, Anshumali Shrivastava*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that RPS, which is both data and model-agnostic, consistently outperforms/matches smaller models and all moderately informed pruning strategies, such as MAG, SNIP, SYNFLOW, and GRASP, across the entire compression range.\n\n**Abstract:** When considering a model architecture, there are several ways to reduce its memory footprint. Historically, popular approaches included selecting smaller architectures and creating sparse networks through pruning. More recently, randomized parameter-sharing (RPS) methods have gained traction for model compression at start of training. In this paper, we comprehensively assess the trade-off between memory and accuracy across RPS, pruning techniques, and building smaller models. Our findings demonstrate that RPS, which is both data and model-agnostic, consistently outperforms/matches smaller models and all moderately informed pruning strategies, such as MAG, SNIP, SYNFLOW, and GRASP, across the entire compression range. This advantage becomes particularly pronounced in higher compression scenarios. Notably, even when compared to highly informed pruning techniques like Lottery Ticket Rewinding (LTR), RPS exhibits superior performance in high compression settings. This points out inherent capacity advantage that RPS enjoys over sparse models. Theoretically, we establish RPS as a superior technique in terms of memory-efficient representation when compared to pruning for linear models. This paper argues in favor of paradigm shift towards RPS based models. During our rigorous evaluation of RPS, we identified issues in the state-of-the-art RPS technique ROAST, specifically regarding stability (ROAST's sensitivity to initialization hyperparameters, often leading to divergence) and Pareto-continuity (ROAST's inability to recover the accuracy of the original model at zero compression). We provably address both of these issues. We refer to the modified RPS, which incorporates our improvements, as STABLE-RPS.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Revisiting Parameter Sharing for Automatic Neural Channel Number Search\n\n*From Search Query: parameter sharing hybrid architectures*\n\n*Jiaxing Wang, Haoli Bai, Jiaxiang Wu, Xupeng Shi, Junzhou Huang, Irwin King, Michael R. Lyu, Jian Cheng*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new strategy of parameter sharing is proposed as a general formulation to unify and quantitatively analyze existing channel search algorithms and demonstrates the superiority of the proposed strategy in channel con\ufb01guration against many state-of-the-art counterparts on benchmark datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in neural architecture search inspire many channel number search algorithms (CNS) for convolutional neural networks. To improve searching ef-\ufb01ciency, parameter sharing is widely applied, which reuses parameters among different channel con\ufb01gurations. Nevertheless, it is unclear how parameter sharing affects the searching process. In this paper, we aim at providing a better understanding and exploitation of parameter sharing for CNS. Speci\ufb01cally, we propose af\ufb01ne parameter sharing (APS) as a general formulation to unify and quantitatively analyze existing channel search algorithms. It is found that with parameter sharing, weight updates of one architecture can simultaneously bene\ufb01t other candidates. However, it also results in less con\ufb01dence in choosing good architectures. We thus propose a new strategy of parameter sharing towards a better balance between training ef\ufb01ciency and architecture discrimination. Extensive analysis and experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed strategy in channel con\ufb01guration against many state-of-the-art counterparts on benchmark datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 7. MCUNetV2: Memory-Efficient Patch-based Inference for Tiny Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient implementation*\n\n*Ji Lin, Wei-Ming Chen, Han Cai, Chuang Gan, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study largely addressed the memory bottleneck in tinyML and paved the way for various vision applications beyond image classification.\n\n**Abstract:** Tiny deep learning on microcontroller units (MCUs) is challenging due to the limited memory size. We find that the memory bottleneck is due to the imbalanced memory distribution in convolutional neural network (CNN) designs: the first several blocks have an order of magnitude larger memory usage than the rest of the network. To alleviate this issue, we propose a generic patch-by-patch inference scheduling, which operates only on a small spatial region of the feature map and significantly cuts down the peak memory. However, naive implementation brings overlapping patches and computation overhead. We further propose network redistribution to shift the receptive field and FLOPs to the later stage and reduce the computation overhead. Manually redistributing the receptive field is difficult. We automate the process with neural architecture search to jointly optimize the neural architecture and inference scheduling, leading to MCUNetV2. Patch-based inference effectively reduces the peak memory usage of existing networks by 4-8x. Co-designed with neural networks, MCUNetV2 sets a record ImageNet accuracy on MCU (71.8%), and achieves>90% accuracy on the visual wake words dataset under only 32kB SRAM. MCUNetV2 also unblocks object detection on tiny devices, achieving 16.9% higher mAP on Pascal VOC compared to the state-of-the-art result.

Backprop with Approximate Activations for Memory-efficient Network Training\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient implementation*\n\n*Ayan Chakrabarti, Benjamin Moseley*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new implementation for back-propagation is proposed that significantly reduces memory usage, by enabling the use of approximations with negligible computational cost and minimal effect on training performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Training convolutional neural network models is memory intensive since back-propagation requires storing activations of all intermediate layers. This presents a practical concern when seeking to deploy very deep architectures in production, especially when models need to be frequently re-trained on updated datasets. In this paper, we propose a new implementation for back-propagation that significantly reduces memory usage, by enabling the use of approximations with negligible computational cost and minimal effect on training performance. The algorithm reuses common buffers to temporarily store full activations and compute the forward pass exactly. It also stores approximate per-layer copies of activations, at significant memory savings, that are used in the backward pass. Compared to simply approximating activations within standard back-propagation, our method limits accumulation of errors across layers. This allows the use of much lower-precision approximations without affecting training accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet show that our method yields performance close to exact training, while storing activations compactly with as low as 4-bit precision.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 9. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient implementation*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Can Active Memory Replace Attention?\n\n*From Search Query: selective mechanisms language models*\n\n*\u0141ukasz Kaiser, Samy Bengio*\n\n**Abstract:** Several mechanisms to focus attention of a neural network on selected parts\nof its input or memory have been used successfully in deep learning models in\nrecent years. Attention has improved image classification, image captioning,\nspeech recognition, generative models, and learning algorithmic tasks, but it\nhad probably the largest impact on neural machine translation.\n  Recently, similar improvements have been obtained using alternative\nmechanisms that do not focus on a single part of a memory but operate on all of\nit in parallel, in a uniform way. Such mechanism, which we call active memory,\nimproved over attention in algorithmic tasks, image processing, and in\ngenerative modelling.\n  So far, however, active memory has not improved over attention for most\nnatural language processing tasks, in particular for machine translation. We\nanalyze this shortcoming in this paper and propose an extended model of active\nmemory that matches existing attention models on neural machine translation and\ngeneralizes better to longer sentences. We investigate this model and explain\nwhy previous active memory models did not succeed. Finally, we discuss when\nactive memory brings most benefits and where attention can be a better choice.\n\n**Conference:** can-active-memory-replace-attention-1\n\n**Published:** 2016-10-27\n\n\n\n#### 2. OxKBC: Outcome Explanation for Factorization Based Knowledge Base Completion\n\n*From Search Query: selective mechanisms language models*\n\n*Mausam, Parag Singla, Mayank Singh Chauhan, Aman Agrawal, Ankesh Gupta, Yatin Nandwani*\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art models for Knowledge Base Completion (KBC) are based on tensor factorization (TF), e.g, DistMult, ComplEx. While they produce good results, they cannot expose any rationale behind their predictions, potentially reducing the trust of a user in the model. Previous works have explored creating an inherently explainable model, e.g. Neural Theorem Proving (NTP), DeepPath, MINERVA, but explainability comes at the cost of performance. Others have tried to create an auxiliary explainable model having high fidelity with the underlying TF model, but unfortunately, they do not scale on large KBs such as FB15k and YAGO.\u00a0In this work, we propose OxKBC -- an Outcome eXplanation engine for KBC, which provides a post-hoc explanation for every triple inferred by an (uninterpretable) factorization based model. It first augments the underlying Knowledge Graph by introducing weighted edges between entities based on their similarity given by the underlying model. In the augmented graph, it defines a notion of human-understandable explanation paths along with a language to generate them. Depending on the edges, the paths are aggregated into second-order templates for further selection. The best template with its grounding is then selected by a neural selection module that is trained with minimal supervision by a novel loss function. Experiments over Mechanical Turk demonstrate that users find our explanations more trustworthy compared to rule mining.\n\n**Proceeding:** akbc-2020-6\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-14\n\n\n\n#### 3. Learning Implicitly Recurrent CNNs Through Parameter Sharing\n\n*From Search Query: parameter sharing hybrid architectures*\n\n*Pedro Savarese, Michael Maire*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a parameter sharing scheme, in which different layers of a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) are defined by a learned linear combination\nof parameter tensors from a global bank of templates. Restricting the number of\ntemplates yields a flexible hybridization of traditional CNNs and recurrent\nnetworks.

TEC-Net: Vision Transformer Embrace Convolutional Neural Networks for Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: parameter sharing hybrid architectures*\n\n*Weichuan Zhang, Asoke K. Nandi, Yong Xia, Yong Wan, Rui Sun, Tao Lei*\n\n**Abstract:** The hybrid architecture of convolution neural networks (CNN) and Transformer has been the most popular method for medical image segmentation. However, the existing networks based on the hybrid architecture suffer from two problems. First, although the CNN branch can capture image local features by using convolution operation, the vanilla convolution is unable to achieve adaptive extraction of image features. Second, although the Transformer branch can model the global information of images, the conventional self-attention only focuses on the spatial self-attention of images and ignores the channel and cross-dimensional self-attention leading to low segmentation accuracy for medical images with complex backgrounds. To solve these problems, we propose vision Transformer embrace convolutional neural networks for medical image segmentation (TEC-Net). Our network has two advantages. First, dynamic deformable convolution (DDConv) is designed in the CNN branch, which not only overcomes the difficulty of adaptive feature extraction using fixed-size convolution kernels, but also solves the defect that different inputs share the same convolution kernel parameters, effectively improving the feature expression ability of CNN branch. Second, in the Transformer branch, a (shifted)-window adaptive complementary attention module ((S)W-ACAM) and compact convolutional projection are designed to enable the network to fully learn the cross-dimensional long-range dependency of medical images with few parameters and calculations. Experimental results show that the proposed TEC-Net provides better medical image segmentation results than SOTA methods including CNN and Transformer networks. In addition, our TEC-Net requires fewer parameters and computational costs and does not rely on pre-training. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/SR0920/TEC-Net.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-07\n\n\n\n#### 5. Memory-Efficient Implementation of DenseNets\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient implementation*\n\n*Kilian Q. Weinberger, Laurens van der Maaten, Tongcheng Li, Gao Huang, Geoff Pleiss, Danlu Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** The DenseNet architecture is highly computationally efficient as a result of\nfeature reuse. However, a naive DenseNet implementation can require a\nsignificant amount of GPU memory: If not properly managed, pre-activation batch\nnormalization and contiguous convolution operations can produce feature maps\nthat grow quadratically with network depth. In this technical report, we\nintroduce strategies to reduce the memory consumption of DenseNets during\ntraining. By strategically using shared memory allocations, we reduce the\nmemory cost for storing feature maps from quadratic to linear. Without the GPU\nmemory bottleneck, it is now possible to train extremely deep DenseNets.\nNetworks with 14M parameters can be trained on a single GPU, up from 4M. A\n264-layer DenseNet (73M parameters), which previously would have been\ninfeasible to train, can now be trained on a single workstation with 8 NVIDIA\nTesla M40 GPUs. On the ImageNet ILSVRC classification dataset, this large\nDenseNet obtains a state-of-the-art single-crop top-1 error of 20.26%.\n\n**Published:** 2017-07-21\n\n\n\n#### 6. Memory-efficient and fast implementation of local adaptive binarization methods\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient implementation*\n\n*Chungkwong Chan*\n\n**Abstract:** Binarization is widely used as an image preprocessing step to separate object especially text from background before recognition. For noisy images with uneven illumination such as degraded documents, threshold values need to be computed pixel by pixel to obtain a good segmentation. Since local threshold values typically depend on moment-based statistics such as mean and variance of gray levels inside rectangular windows, integral images which are memory consuming are commonly used to accelerate the calculation. Observed that moment-based statistics as well as quantiles in a sliding window can be computed recursively, integral images can be avoided without neglecting speed, more binarization methods can be accelerated too. In particular, given a $H\\times W$ input image, Sauvola's method and alike can run in $\\Theta (HW)$ time independent of window size, while only around $6\\min\\{H,W\\}$ bytes of auxiliary space is needed, which is significantly lower than the $16HW$ bytes occupied by the two integral images. Since the proposed technique enable various well-known local adaptive binarization methods to be applied in real-time use cases on devices with limited resources, it has the potential of wide application.\n\n**Published:** 2019-05-30\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, focusing on selective mechanisms, parameter sharing in hybrid architectures, and memory-efficient implementation strategies is crucial. Here are some key findings and references that align with the researcher's goals:\n\n## Selective Mechanisms in Language Models\n\n### Selective Attention Layers\nThe Taipan model introduces Selective Attention Layers (SALs) within the Mamba framework, which combines the efficiency of Mamba with Transformer-style attention. SALs use a gating network to identify important tokens, refining and augmenting their representations. This approach allows Taipan to capture complex, non-Markovian dependencies efficiently.\n\n### Selective Retrieval\nThe Repoformer model uses a selective retrieval mechanism to decide whether to retrieve contextual information from a code repository. This approach improves code completion accuracy while reducing inference latency by up to 70%, demonstrating the effectiveness of selective mechanisms in optimizing resource allocation.\n\n### Selective Attention\nThe concept of selective attention is also explored in the context of standard Transformer models. By reducing attention to unneeded elements, selective attention improves language modeling performance and reduces memory and compute requirements during inference. This approach allows for equivalent performance with fewer parameters and heads in the attention modules.\n\n## Parameter Sharing in Hybrid Architectures\n\n### Combining SSMs and Attention\nTaipan's architecture combines Mamba-2 blocks with strategically placed Selective Attention Layers. This hybrid structure leverages the efficiency of SSMs for sequence processing while incorporating attention mechanisms to handle complex, long-range dependencies. The model processes input through Mamba-2 blocks, with SALs periodically refining key token representations, which are then passed into subsequent Mamba-2 layers.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Algorithm\nThe Mamba model employs a hardware-aware algorithm that streamlines storage and processing through parallel operations, kernel fusion, and recomputation. This approach enhances the model's efficiency, allowing it to handle larger datasets without compromising performance. The integration of selective mechanisms within this framework further optimizes resource allocation.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementation Strategies\n\n### Sparse Sequence-to-Sequence Models\nSparse sequence-to-sequence models, such as those described in the context of S6 and Mamba models, use modality-aware sparsity techniques to reduce computational complexity. These models implement selective scan algorithms and hardware-aware designs to optimize processing efficiency, making them more suitable for real-time applications and large datasets.\n\n### Tiling and Hierarchical Processing\nThe Taipan model's use of a sliding window attention mechanism with a sparser attention weight map enhances computational efficiency. This approach allows for a longer sliding window to capture longer-range dependencies while reducing memory and compute requirements. Additionally, hierarchical processing and tiling can be used to implement linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner, further improving memory efficiency.\n\n### Efficient Attention Mechanisms\nSelective attention mechanisms, as discussed in the context of Transformer models, can significantly reduce the size of the attention context buffer, leading to meaningful reductions in memory and compute requirements during inference. For example, transformers with selective attention require up to 47X less memory for their attention module compared to those without selective attention.\n\nThese findings and approaches highlight the potential of selective mechanisms, hybrid architectures combining SSMs and attention, and memory-efficient implementation strategies to improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of autoregressive language models.\n",

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.85)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 57/74 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\n2019.

In: arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.08136 (2022). ## A Discussion: Selection Mechanism\n\nOur selection mechanism is inspired by and related to concepts such as gating, hypernetworks, and data-dependence. It can also be viewed as related to \"fast weights\" (J. Ba et al. 2016; Schmidhuber 1992), which connects classical RNNs with the mechanism of linear attention (Schlag, Irie, and Schmidhuber 2021). However, we believe that it is a distinct concept that is worth clarifying. Gating. Gating originally referred to the gating mechanisms of RNNs such as the LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) and GRU (J. Chung et al. 2014), or the gated equation (5) in Theorem 1. This was interpreted as a particular mechanism for controlling whether to let an input into the hidden state of an RNN. In particular, this affects the propagation of signal through time and causes inputs to interact along the sequence length dimension. However, the concept of gating has since been relaxed in popular usage to simply mean any multiplicative interaction (often with an activation function). For example, elementwise multiplicative components of neural network architectures (that do not interact along sequence length) are now commonly referred to as gated architectures (Hua et al. 2022; Mehta et al. 2023), despite a very different meaning than the original RNN sense. Thus we believe the original concept of $R N N$ gating versus the popular usage of multiplicative gating actually have a very different semantic meaning. Hypernetworks. Hypernetworks refer to neural networks whose parameters are themselves generated by smaller neural networks. The original idea (Ha, Dai, and Quoc V. Le 2017) used it in a narrow sense to define a large RNN whose recurrent parameters are generated by a smaller RNN, and other variants have been around for a long time (Schmidhuber 1992). Data-dependence. Similar to hypernetworks, data-dependence can refer to any notion where some parameters of the model depend on the data (Poli et al. 2023). Example: GLU Activation. To illustrate the issues with these concepts, consider a simple diagonal linear layer $y=D x$, where $D$ is a diagonal weight parameter. Now suppose that $D$ is itself generated from a linear transformation of $x$, with an optional nonlinearity: $D=\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{W} x)$. Since it is diagonal, the multiplication becomes an elementwise product: $y=\\sigma(W x) \\circ x$. This is a rather trivial transformation, yet it technically satisfies the common meanings of gating (since it has a multiplicative \"branch\"), hypernetworks (since the parameter $\\boldsymbol{D}$ is generated by another layer), and data-dependent (since $\\boldsymbol{D}$ depends on the data $x$ ). However, this in fact simply defines a GLU function, which is so simple that it is often considered just an activation function (Dauphin et al. 2017; Shazeer 2020) instead of a meaningful layer. Selection. Thus, while selection mechanisms could be considered a special case of ideas such as architectural gating, hypernetworks, or data-dependence, so can an enormous range of other constructions-essentially anything with a multiplication, including standard attention mechanisms (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017) as well-and we find it uninformative to think of them as such. Instead, we view it as most closely related to the gating mechanism of traditional RNNs, which is a special case (Theorem 1) and also has a deeper history of connections to SSMs through variable (input-dependent) discretization of $\\Delta$ (Funahashi and Nakamura 1993; Gu, Dao, et al. 2020; Tallec and Ollivier 2018). We also eschew the term \"gating\" in favor of selection to clarify the overloaded use of former. More narrowly, we use selection to refer to the mechanistic action of a model to select or ignore inputs and facilitate data interaction along the sequence length (Section 3.1). Beyond selective SSMs and gated RNNs, other examples may include input-dependent convolutions (Kosma, Nikolentzos, and Vazirgiannis 2023; Lioutas and Guo 2020; Lutati, Zimerman, and Wolf 2023; Yang et al. 2019) and even attention. ## B Related Work\n\nWe overview several prior works related to our methods. We mention that some of the most closely related models include recurrent layers such as S4, S5, and quasi-RNNs; as well as end-to-end architectures such as H3, RetNet, and RWKV. ## B. 1 S4 Variants and Derivatives\n\nWe describe a brief overview of some structured SSMs from past work, particularly those that have a relation to our method. - S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) introduced the first structured SSM, describing diagonal structure and diagonal plus low-rank (DPLR). It focused on efficient convolutional algorithms for DPLR SSMs due to a connection to continuous-time online memorization (HIPPO) (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020). - DSS (Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022) first discovered the empirical effectiveness of diagonal structured SSMs by approximating the HIPPO initialization. This was expanded on theoretically in S4D (Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022). - S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) independently discovered the diagonal SSM approximation, and is the first S4 model to be computed recurrently with the parallel scan. However, this required lowering the effective state dimension, which they accomplished by switching the SSM dimensions from a SISO (single-input single-output) to MIMO (multi-input multi-output) formulation. Our proposed S6 shares the scan, but differs by (i) keeping the SISO dimensions, which provides a larger effective recurrent state, (ii) using a hardware-aware algorithm to overcome the computation issue, (iii) adding the selection mechanism. Lu et al. (2023) applied S5 to meta-RL in order to handle resetting the SSM state between episode trajectories. Their mechanism can be viewed as a particular hard-coded instance of a selection mechanism, where $\\bar{A}$ is manually set to 0 , instead of our learnable mechanism that depends on the input. It would be interesting to apply selective SSMs generically to this setting and probe if the model has learned to automatically reset its state on episode boundaries. - Mega (Ma et al. 2023) introduced a simplification of S4 to be real- instead of complex- valued, giving it an interpretation of being an exponential moving average (EMA). They additionally make an interesting connection of the discretization step of SSMs to an EMA damping term. Contrary to findings in the original S4 papers, this was the first model to show that real-valued SSMs are empirically effective in certain settings or when combined with different architectural components. - Liquid S4 (Hasani et al. 2023) is also motivated by augmenting S4 with an input-dependent state transition. From this perspective it shares similarity to selection mechanisms, although in a limited form which is still computed convolutionally and close to LTI. - SGConv (Y. Li et al. 2023), Hyena (Poli et al. 2023), LongConv (Fu et al. 2023), MultiresConv (J. Shi, K. A. Wang, and Fox 2023), and Toeplitz Neural Network (Qin, Han, W. Sun, B. He, et al. 2023) all focus on the convolutional representation of S4 and create global or long convolution kernels with different parameterizations. However, these methods cannot do fast autoregressive inference directly. Notably, all of these methods, and all other structured SSMs that we are aware of, have been non-selective and usually strictly LTI (linear time invariant). ## B. 2 SSM Architectures\n\nWe use SSM architectures or state space neural networks (SSNN) to refer to deep neural network architectures incorporating one of the previous SSMs as a black box layer. - GSS (Mehta et al. 2023) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs. It is motivated by the gated attention unit (GAU) of Hua et al. (2022) and looks quite similar to our block, except with additional projections. Most importantly, its projection contracts the model dimension to reduce the state size of the SSM, while ours expands the model dimension in order to increase the state size, based on the motivation in Section 3.1. - Mega (Ma et al. 2023) combined the EMA simplification of S4 described above into a hybrid architecture using an efficient attention approximation. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) is motivated by combining S4 with linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). It is the first to generalize this formulation of linear attention to more general recurrences, which is also the basis of later architectures. - Selective S4 (J. Wang et al. 2023) incorporates S4 as a black box to generate a binary mask which is multiplied on the input. While sharing the \"selection\" name, we consider this an architectural modification that is closer to architectural gating than a selection mechanism (Appendix A). For example, we hypothesize that it would not solve the Selective\n\nCopying task because simply masking out the irrelevant inputs does not affect the spacing between the relevant ones (indeed, the Selective Copying task can even be viewed as coming pre-masked if the noise tokens are embedded to 0 ).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/74 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\nSun et al. 2023). ### 3.5 Properties of Selection Mechanisms\n\nThe selection mechanism is a broader concept that can be applied in different ways, such as to more traditional RNNs or CNNs, to different parameters (e.g. A in Algorithm 2), or using different transformations $s(x)$. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_9db7b10d0e19303048adg-08.jpg?height=619&width=1548&top_left_y=238&top_left_x=321)\n\nFigure 3: (Architecture.) Our simplified block design combines the H3 block, which is the basis of most SSM architectures, with the ubiquitous MLP block of modern neural networks. Instead of interleaving these two blocks, we simply repeat the Mamba block homogenously. Compared to the H3 block, Mamba replaces the first multiplicative gate with an activation function. Compared to the MLP block, Mamba adds an SSM to the main branch. For $\\sigma$ we use the SiLU / Swish activation (Hendrycks and Gimpel 2016; Ramachandran, Zoph, and Quoc V Le 2017). ### 3.5.1 Connection to Gating Mechanisms\n\nWe highlight the most important connection: the classical gating mechanism of RNNs is an instance of our selection mechanism for SSMs. We note that the connection between RNN gating and the discretization of continuous-time systems is well established (Funahashi and Nakamura 1993; Tallec and Ollivier 2018). In fact, Theorem 1 is an improvement of Gu , Johnson, Goel, et al. (2021, Lemma 3.1) generalizing to the ZOH discretization and input-dependent gates (proof in Appendix C). More broadly, $\\Delta$ in SSMs can be seen to play a generalized role of the RNN gating mechanism. In line with prior work, we adopt the view that discretization of SSMs is the principled foundation of heuristic gating mechanisms. Theorem 1. When $N=1, \\boldsymbol{A}=-1, \\boldsymbol{B}=1, s_{\\Delta}=\\operatorname{Linear}(x)$, and $\\tau_{\\Delta}=$ softplus, then the selective SSM recurrence (Algorithm 2) takes the form\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& g_{t}=\\sigma\\left(\\operatorname{Linear}\\left(x_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& h_{t}=\\left(1-g_{t}\\right) h_{t-1}+g_{t} x_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs mentioned in Section 3.2, our specific choices of $s_{\\Delta}, \\tau_{\\Delta}$ is from this connection. In particular, note that if a given input $x_{t}$ should be completely ignored (as necessary in the synthetic tasks), all $D$ channels should ignore it, and so we project the input down to 1 dimension before repeating/broadcasting with $\\Delta$. ### 3.5.2 Interpretation of Selection Mechanisms\n\nWe elaborate on three particular mechanistic effects of selection. Variable Spacing. Selectivity allows filtering out irrelevant noise tokens that may occur between inputs of interest. This is exemplified by the Selective Copying task, but occurs ubiquitously in common data modalities, particularly for discrete data - for example the presence of language fillers such as \"um\". This property arises because the model can mechanistically filter out any particular input $x_{t}$, for example in the gated RNN case (Theorem 1 ) when $g_{t} \\rightarrow 0$. Filtering Context. It has been empirically observed that many sequence models do not improve with longer context ( F . Shi et al. 2023), despite the principle that more context should lead to strictly better performance. An explanation is that many sequence models cannot effectively ignore irrelevant context when necessary; an intuitive example are global convolutions (and general LTI models). On the other hand, selective models can simply reset their state at any time to remove extraneous history, and thus their performance in principle improves monotonicly with context length (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/24 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.09728, 2019.

Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.68)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.68)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads.

Artificial Neuronal Ensembles with Learned Context Dependent Gating\n\n*From Search Query: selective gating implementations*\n\n*M. Tilley, Michelle Miller, David J. Freedman*\n\n**TL;DR:** Learned Context Dependent Gating (LXDG) is introduced, a method to flexibly allocate and recall `artificial neuronal ensembles', using a particular network structure and a new set of regularization terms to alleviate catastrophic forgetting on continual learning benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** Biological neural networks are capable of recruiting different sets of neurons to encode different memories. However, when training artificial neural networks on a set of tasks, typically, no mechanism is employed for selectively producing anything analogous to these neuronal ensembles. Further, artificial neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where the network's performance rapidly deteriorates as tasks are learned sequentially. By contrast, sequential learning is possible for a range of biological organisms. We introduce Learned Context Dependent Gating (LXDG), a method to flexibly allocate and recall `artificial neuronal ensembles', using a particular network structure and a new set of regularization terms. Activities in the hidden layers of the network are modulated by gates, which are dynamically produced during training. The gates are outputs of networks themselves, trained with a sigmoid output activation. The regularization terms we have introduced correspond to properties exhibited by biological neuronal ensembles. The first term penalizes low gate sparsity, ensuring that only a specified fraction of the network is used. The second term ensures that previously learned gates are recalled when the network is presented with input from previously learned tasks. Finally, there is a regularization term responsible for ensuring that new tasks are encoded in gates that are as orthogonal as possible from previously used ones. We demonstrate the ability of this method to alleviate catastrophic forgetting on continual learning benchmarks. When the new regularization terms are included in the model along with Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) it achieves better performance on the benchmark `permuted MNIST' than with EWC alone. The benchmark `rotated MNIST' demonstrates how similar tasks recruit similar neurons to the artificial neuronal ensemble.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Just Fine-tune Twice: Selective Differential Privacy for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: selective gating implementations*\n\n*Weiyan Shi, Si Chen, Chiyuan Zhang, R. Jia, Zhou Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel framework, *Just Fine-tune Twice* (JFT), that achieves SDP for state-of-the-art large transformer-based models and studies the scenario of imperfect implementation of policy functions that misses sensitive tokens and develops systematic methods to handle it.\n\n**Abstract:** Protecting large language models from privacy leakage is becoming increasingly crucial with their wide adoption in real-world products. Yet applying *differential privacy* (DP), a canonical notion with provable privacy guarantees for machine learning models, to those models remains challenging due to the trade-off between model utility and privacy loss. Utilizing the fact that sensitive information in language data tends to be sparse, Shi et al. (2021) formalized a DP notion extension called *Selective Differential Privacy* (SDP) to protect only the sensitive tokens defined by a policy function. However, their algorithm only works for RNN-based models. In this paper, we develop a novel framework, *Just Fine-tune Twice* (JFT), that achieves SDP for state-of-the-art large transformer-based models. Our method is easy to implement: it first fine-tunes the model with *redacted* in-domain data, and then fine-tunes it again with the *original* in-domain data using a private training mechanism. Furthermore, we study the scenario of imperfect implementation of policy functions that misses sensitive tokens and develop systematic methods to handle it. Experiments show that our method achieves strong utility compared to previous baselines. We also analyze the SDP privacy guarantee empirically with the canary insertion attack.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Channel Gating Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: selective gating implementations*\n\n*Weizhe Hua, Christopher De Sa, Zhiru Zhang, G. Suh*\n\n**TL;DR:** An accelerator is designed for channel gating, a dynamic, fine-grained, and hardware-efficient pruning scheme to reduce the computation cost for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which optimizes CNN inference at run-time by exploiting input-specific characteristics.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces channel gating, a dynamic, fine-grained, and hardware-efficient pruning scheme to reduce the computation cost for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Channel gating identifies regions in the features that contribute less to the classification result, and skips the computation on a subset of the input channels for these ineffective regions. Unlike static network pruning, channel gating optimizes CNN inference at run-time by exploiting input-specific characteristics, which allows substantially reducing the compute cost with almost no accuracy loss. We experimentally show that applying channel gating in state-of-the-art networks achieves 2.7-8.0$\\times$ reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs) and 2.0-4.4$\\times$ reduction in off-chip memory accesses with a minimal accuracy loss on CIFAR-10. Combining our method with knowledge distillation reduces the compute cost of ResNet-18 by 2.6$\\times$ without accuracy drop on ImageNet. We further demonstrate that channel gating can be realized in hardware efficiently. Our approach exhibits sparsity patterns that are well-suited to dense systolic arrays with minimal additional hardware. We have designed an accelerator for channel gating networks, which can be implemented using either FPGAs or ASICs. Running a quantized ResNet-18 model for ImageNet, our accelerator achieves an encouraging speedup of 2.4$\\times$ on average, with a theoretical FLOP reduction of 2.8$\\times$.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 168  (*Influential: 16*)\n\n#### 4. Dynamic and Efficient Inference for Text Generation via BERT Family\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic parameter generation*\n\n*Xiaobo Liang, Juntao Li, Lijun Wu, Ziqiang Cao, M. Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel fine-tuning method DEER, which can make a single pre-trained model support Dynamic and Efficient infERence and achieve an adaptive trade-off between model performance and latency and explores the effectiveness of the pre- trained MLMs for text generation tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the excellent performance of Pre-trained Language Models on many text generation tasks, they suffer from inefficient inference on computation and memory due to their large-scale parameters and the universal autoregressive decoding paradigm. In this work, we propose a novel fine-tuning method DEER, which can make a single pre-trained model support Dynamic and Efficient infERence and achieve an adaptive trade-off between model performance and latency. In particular, our critical insight is to jointly utilize the non-autoregressive (NAR) generation and dynamic parameter pruning techniques, which can flexibly control the decoding iteration steps and model sizes according to memory and latency limitations. Besides, we also explore the effectiveness of the pre-trained MLMs (i.e., the BERT family) for text generation tasks since their bidirectional attention nature is more suitable for the NAR training objective. Extensive experiments on both monolingual and multilingual pre-trained MLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DEER method by consistently achieving (1) higher BLEU scores than the strong autoregressive Transformer model on three neural machine translation tasks with 3 \\to 12 times speedup, (2) competitive performance (but with much faster inference speed) compared with the BART model on four GLGE benchmark tasks.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6. Lightweight, Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks for AMR-to-Text Generation\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic parameter generation*\n\n*Yan Zhang, Zhijiang Guo, Zhiyang Teng, Wei Lu, Shay B. Cohen, Zuozhu Liu, Lidong Bing*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs and develops two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** AMR-to-text generation is used to transduce Abstract Meaning Representation structures (AMR) into text. A key challenge in this task is to efficiently learn effective graph representations. Previously, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) were used to encode input AMRs, however, vanilla GCNs are not able to capture non-local information and additionally, they follow a local (first-order) information aggregation scheme. To account for these issues, larger and deeper GCN models are required to capture more complex interactions. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic fusion mechanism, proposing Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs. We further develop two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity. With the help of these strategies, we are able to train a model with fewer parameters while maintaining the model capacity. Experiments demonstrate that LDGCNs outperform state-of-the-art models on two benchmark datasets for AMR-to-text generation with significantly fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 7. An Efficient Memory-Augmented Transformer for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient memory access*\n\n*Yuxiang Wu, Yu Zhao, Baotian Hu, Pasquale Minervini, Pontus Stenetorp, Sebastian Riedel*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Efficient Memory-Augmented Transformer (EMAT) is proposed \u2013 it encodes external knowledge into a key-value memory and exploits the fast maximum inner product search for memory querying and produces more accurate results on WoW and ELI5.\n\n**Abstract:** Access to external knowledge is essential for many natural language processing tasks, such as question answering and dialogue. Existing methods often rely on a parametric model that stores knowledge in its parameters, or use a retrieval-augmented model that has access to an external knowledge source. Parametric and retrieval-augmented models have complementary strengths in terms of computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. To combine the strength of both approaches, we propose the Efficient Memory-Augmented Transformer (EMAT) \u2013 it encodes external knowledge into a key-value memory and exploits the fast maximum inner product search for memory querying. We also introduce pre-training tasks that allow EMAT to encode informative key-value representations, and to learn an implicit strategy to integrate multiple memory slots into the transformer. Experiments on various knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering and dialogue datasets show that, simply augmenting parametric models (T5-base) using our method produces more accurate results (e.g., 25.8 \u2192 44.3 EM on NQ) while retaining a high throughput (e.g., 1000 queries/s on NQ). Compared to retrieval-augmented models, EMAT runs substantially faster across the board and produces more accurate results on WoW and ELI5.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 8.

C. D. Mundo, Mohammad Rastegari, Mehrdad Farajtabar*\n\n**TL;DR:** The integration of sparsity awareness, context-adaptive loading, and a hardware-oriented design paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are central to modern natural language processing, delivering exceptional performance in various tasks. However, their substantial computational and memory requirements present challenges, especially for devices with limited DRAM capacity. This paper tackles the challenge of efficiently running LLMs that exceed the available DRAM capacity by storing the model parameters in flash memory, but bringing them on demand to DRAM. Our method involves constructing an inference cost model that takes into account the characteristics of flash memory, guiding us to optimize in two critical areas: reducing the volume of data transferred from flash and reading data in larger, more contiguous chunks. Within this hardware-informed framework, we introduce two principal techniques. First,\"windowing\"strategically reduces data transfer by reusing previously activated neurons, and second,\"row-column bundling\", tailored to the sequential data access strengths of flash memory, increases the size of data chunks read from flash memory. These methods collectively enable running models up to twice the size of the available DRAM, with a 4-5x and 20-25x increase in inference speed compared to naive loading approaches in CPU and GPU, respectively. Our integration of sparsity awareness, context-adaptive loading, and a hardware-oriented design paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 58  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 9.

Researchers are now beginning to use recent advances in machine learning in software optimizations, augmenting or replacing traditional heuristics and data structures. However, the space of machine learning for computer hardware architecture is only lightly explored. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of deep learning to address the von Neumann bottleneck of memory performance. We focus on the critical problem of learning memory access patterns, with the goal of constructing accurate and efficient memory prefetchers. We relate contemporary prefetching strategies to n-gram models in natural language processing, and show how recurrent neural networks can serve as a drop-in replacement. On a suite of challenging benchmark datasets, we find that neural networks consistently demonstrate superior performance in terms of precision and recall.

Improving Distant Supervised Relation Extraction by Dynamic Neural\n  Network\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic parameter generation*\n\n*Yanjie Gou, Yinjie Lei, Lingqiao Liu, Pingping Zhang, Xi Peng*\n\n**Abstract:** Distant Supervised Relation Extraction (DSRE) is usually formulated as a\nproblem of classifying a bag of sentences that contain two query entities, into\nthe predefined relation classes. Most existing methods consider those relation\nclasses as distinct semantic categories while ignoring their potential\nconnection to query entities. In this paper, we propose to leverage this\nconnection to improve the relation extraction accuracy. Our key ideas are\ntwofold: (1) For sentences belonging to the same relation class, the expression\nstyle, i.e. words choice, can vary according to the query entities. To account\nfor this style shift, the model should adjust its parameters in accordance with\nentity types. (2) Some relation classes are semantically similar, and the\nentity types appear in one relation may also appear in others. Therefore, it\ncan be trained cross different relation classes and further enhance those\nclasses with few samples, i.e., long-tail classes. To unify these two\narguments, we developed a novel Dynamic Neural Network for Relation Extraction\n(DNNRE). The network adopts a novel dynamic parameter generator that\ndynamically generates the network parameters according to the query entity\ntypes and relation classes. By using this mechanism, the network can\nsimultaneously handle the style shift problem and enhance the prediction\naccuracy for long-tail classes. Through our experimental study, we demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method and show that it can achieve superior\nperformance over the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-15T06:31:13Z  (*Updated: 2019-12-13T04:29:41Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

The proposed approach is composed of several separation heads optimized together with a speaker classification branch. The separation is carried out in the time domain, together with parameter sharing between all separation heads. The classification branch estimates the number of speakers while each head is specialized in separating a different number of speakers. We evaluate the proposed model under both clean and noisy reverberant set-tings. Results suggest that the proposed approach is superior to the baseline model by a significant margin.

Joint Parameter Discovery and Generative Modeling of Dynamic Systems\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic parameter generation*\n\n*Tzikang Chen, Mulugeta A. Haile, Gregory Barber*\n\n**Abstract:** Given an unknown dynamic system such as a coupled harmonic oscillator with $n$ springs and point masses. We are often interested in gaining insights into its physical parameters, i.e. stiffnesses and masses, by observing trajectories of motion. How do we achieve this from video frames or time-series data and without the knowledge of the dynamics model? We present a neural framework for estimating physical parameters in a manner consistent with the underlying physics. The neural framework uses a deep latent variable model to disentangle the system physical parameters from canonical coordinate observations. It then returns a Hamiltonian parameterization that generalizes well with respect to the discovered physical parameters. We tested our framework with simple harmonic oscillators, $n=1$, and noisy observations and show that it discovers the underlying system parameters and generalizes well with respect to these discovered parameters. Our model also extrapolates the dynamics of the system beyond the training interval and outperforms a non-physically constrained baseline model.

ConvBERT: Improving BERT with Span-based Dynamic Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic parameter generation*\n\n*Zi-Hang Jiang, Yunpeng Chen, Weihao Yu, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan, Daquan Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models like BERT and its variants have recently achieved impressive performance in various natural language understanding tasks. However, BERT heavily relies on the global self-attention block and thus suffers large memory footprint and computation cost. Although all its attention heads query on the whole input sequence for generating the attention map from a global perspective, we observe some heads only need to learn local dependencies, which means the existence of computation redundancy. We therefore propose a novel span-based dynamic convolution to replace these self-attention heads to directly model local dependencies. The novel convolution heads, together with the rest self-attention heads, form a new mixed attention block that is more efficient at both global and local context learning. We equip BERT with this mixed attention design and build a ConvBERT model. Experiments have shown that ConvBERT significantly outperforms BERT and its variants in various downstream tasks, with lower training cost and fewer model parameters. Remarkably, ConvBERTbase model achieves 86.4 GLUE score, 0.7 higher than ELECTRAbase, while using less than 1/4 training cost. Code and pre-trained models will be released.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-08-06\n\n\n\n#### 5. Variational Inference with Gaussian Score Matching\n\n*From Search Query: efficient memory access*\n\n*Lawrence Saul, David Blei, Robert Gower, Yuling Yao, Charles Margossian, Chirag Modi*\n\n**Abstract:** Variational inference (VI) is a method to approximate the computationally intractable posterior distributions that arise in Bayesian statistics. Typically, VI fits a simple parametric distribution to the target posterior by minimizing an appropriate objective such as the evidence lower bound (ELBO). In this work, we present a new approach to VI based on the principle of score matching, that if two distributions are equal then their score functions (i.e., gradients of the log density) are equal at every point on their support. With this, we develop score matching VI, an iterative algorithm that seeks to match the scores between the variational approximation and the exact posterior. At each iteration, score matching VI solves an inner optimization, one that minimally adjusts the current variational estimate to match the scores at a newly sampled value of the latent variables. We show that when the variational family is a Gaussian, this inner optimization enjoys a closed form solution, which we call Gaussian score matching VI (GSM-VI). GSM-VI is also a ``black box'' variational algorithm in that it only requires a differentiable joint distribution, and as such it can be applied to a wide class of models. We compare GSM-VI to black box variational inference (BBVI), which has similar requirements but instead optimizes the ELBO. We study how GSM-VI behaves as a function of the problem dimensionality, the condition number of the target covariance matrix (when the target is Gaussian), and the degree of mismatch between the approximating and exact posterior distribution. We also study GSM-VI on a collection of real-world Bayesian inference problems from the posteriorDB database of datasets and models. In all of our studies we find that GSM-VI is faster than BBVI, but without sacrificing accuracy. It requires 10-100x fewer gradient evaluations to obtain a comparable quality of approximation.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2023-11\n\n**Published:** 2023-07-15\n\n\n\n#### 6. EMOGI: Efficient Memory-access for Out-of-memory Graph-traversal In GPUs\n\n*From Search Query: efficient memory access*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Modern analytics and recommendation systems are increasingly based on graph data that capture the relations between entities being analyzed. Practical graphs come in huge sizes, offer massive parallelism, and are stored in sparse-matrix formats such as CSR. To exploit the massive parallelism, developers are increasingly interested in using GPUs for graph traversal. However, due to their sizes, graphs often do not fit into the GPU memory. Prior works have either used input data pre-processing/partitioning or UVM to migrate chunks of data from the host memory to the GPU memory. However, the large, multi-dimensional, and sparse nature of graph data presents a major challenge to these schemes and results in significant amplification of data movement and reduced effective data throughput. In this work, we propose EMOGI, an alternative approach to traverse graphs that do not fit in GPU memory using direct cacheline-sized access to data stored in host memory. This paper addresses the open question of whether a sufficiently large number of overlapping cacheline-sized accesses can be sustained to 1) tolerate the long latency to host memory, 2) fully utilize the available bandwidth, and 3) achieve favorable execution performance. We analyze the data access patterns of several graph traversal applications in GPU over PCIe using an FPGA to understand the cause of poor external bandwidth utilization. By carefully coalescing and aligning external memory requests, we show that we can minimize the number of PCIe transactions and nearly fully utilize the PCIe bandwidth even with direct cache-line accesses to the host memory. EMOGI achieves 2.92$\\times$ speedup on average compared to the optimized UVM implementations in various graph traversal applications. We also show that EMOGI scales better than a UVM-based solution when the system uses higher bandwidth interconnects such as PCIe 4.0.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-12\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model (LM) design focusing on selective gating mechanisms, dynamic parameter generation, and efficient memory access patterns, here are some key findings and references that align with your goals:\n\n## Selective Gating Mechanisms\n\n### SeerAttention\nThe \"SeerAttention\" mechanism introduced in the paper \"SeerAttention: Learning Intrinsic Sparse Attention in Your LLMs\" is particularly relevant. This approach uses a learnable gate to adaptively select significant blocks in the attention map, reducing the computational and I/O overhead by skipping unimportant blocks. This method enhances the standard attention mechanism with a block-sparse FlashAttention kernel, which can significantly improve efficiency while maintaining accuracy.\n\n### Gated Linear Attention\nThe \"Gated Linear Attention\" mechanism generalizes linear attention with data-dependent gates, which can perform competitively against other architectures like LLaMA. This gating mechanism improves expressiveness and efficiency, making it a viable option for selective processing in LMs.\n\n### LSTM Gating Mechanisms\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks also employ selective gating mechanisms through input, output, and forget gates. These gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell state, allowing the network to selectively retain or discard information. This is a well-established method for managing long-term dependencies and can be adapted or integrated into LM designs.\n\n## Dynamic Parameter Generation\n\n### SeerAttention\nThe SeerAttention mechanism involves training an Attention Gate (AttnGate) that dynamically identifies significant blocks in the attention map. This learnable gate allows for adaptive sparsity patterns, which can be seen as a form of dynamic parameter generation. The AttnGate is trained using the 2D max-pooled attention map as ground truth, enabling the model to adaptively adjust its attention patterns.\n\n### Episodic Memory Control\nThe \"Larimar\" architecture, which enhances LLMs with a distributed episodic memory, allows for dynamic, one-shot updates of knowledge without the need for re-training or fine-tuning. This dynamic memory update mechanism can be considered a form of dynamic parameter generation, as it adapts the model's parameters based on new information[Analysis Note].\n\n## Efficient Memory Access Patterns\n\n### SeerAttention and FlashAttention\nThe SeerAttention mechanism leverages block-level sparsity and integrates with the tiling computation scheme of FlashAttention. This approach reduces I/O and computation overhead by processing only significant blocks, making it highly efficient in terms of memory access and computation.\n\n### Patch-based Inference\nThe \"MCUNetV2\" approach uses patch-by-patch inference scheduling, which operates on a small spatial region of the feature map and significantly cuts down the peak memory usage. This method involves network redistribution to shift the receptive field and FLOPs to later stages, optimizing memory access patterns and reducing overall memory requirements[Analysis Note].\n\n### Hierarchical Processing\nHierarchical processing strategies, such as those mentioned in the analysis note, enable efficient scaling by managing memory access in a hierarchical manner. This involves processing data in smaller chunks and using parameter sharing strategies to minimize memory usage[Analysis Note].\n\nBy incorporating these selective gating mechanisms, dynamic parameter generation techniques, and efficient memory access patterns, researchers can significantly improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of autoregressive language models.\n",

Many of these efficient transformer variants use some form of nonuniform or local attention mechanisms or a combination thereof. For example, LongFormer (Beltagy et al., 2020) makes use\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_919c88d12b3772ebde65g-30.jpg?height=2021&width=957&top_left_y=361&top_left_x=584)\n\nFigure 10: Eagle Overall Architecture. of the sliding window attention and BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020) adopts randomized sparse and random attention patterns to approximate full attention. Similar examples also include LongT5 (Guo et al., 2022) and StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023). Instead of using fixed patterns, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2019) and Sparse Sinkhorn attention (Tay et al., 2020) learn to dynamically pay attention to selected tokens.Variants including Linformer (Wang et al., 2020), Nystr\u00f6mformer (Xiong et al., 2021) and Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) apply matrix approximation methods to approximate the full attention matrix but with lower computational complexity. The Attention Free Transformer (AFT) (Zhai et al., 2021) introduces a modified form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020a) , where the number of attention heads is equal to the size of the feature dimension. It also incorporates a set of learned pairwise positional biases, denoted as $w$. The AFT can be conceptualized as calculating a per-channel weighted average of values. The weight for a specific location is determined by the sum of the key at that location and the corresponding learned positional bias. Token-shift, as first seen in RWKV-4, is a learned per-channel linear interpolation between the current input and the input at the previous time step, intended to enhance the model with a computationally inexpensive mechanism for choosing between new versus older information within various embedding sub-spaces and for forming induction heads even within a single layer. It is instructive to compare token-shift to a 1D convolution with kernel length 2, as it operates in a similar manner but reuses its parameters via an enforced linear relationship. Recent SSMs have begun using short convolutions in a similar placement within their architectures, typically with kernel length 3 to 4. (Poli et al., 2023; Gu \\& Dao, 2023)\n\nRetentive Networks (RetNet) (Sun et al., 2023) introduces a fixed decay rate schedule and xPos (Sun et al., 2022) to linear attention. This design combines positional information with an inductive bias towards recency while still allowing both RNN and parallel implementations.\n```\n\n#### 2.

The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/29 (Score: 0.76)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.05254, 2024b.

However, existing methods struggle with either computational complexity or model expressivity, rendering the maximum sequence length restricted. In this work, we introduce LongNet, a Transformer variant that can scale sequence length to more than 1 billion tokens, without sacrificing the performance on shorter sequences. Specifically, we propose dilated attention, which expands the attentive field exponentially as the distance grows. LongNet has significant advantages: 1) it has a linear computation complexity and a logarithm dependency between tokens; 2) it can be served as a distributed trainer for extremely long sequences; 3) its dilated attention is a drop-in replacement for standard attention, which can be seamlessly integrated with the existing Transformer-based optimization. Experiments results demonstrate that LongNet yields strong performance on both long-sequence modeling and general language tasks. Our work opens up new possibilities for modeling very long sequences, e.g., treating a whole corpus or even the entire Internet as a sequence.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/20 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2204.02311, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DDM}^{+}\\right.$23] Mostafa Dehghani, Josip Djolonga, Basil Mustafa, Piotr Padlewski, Jonathan Heek, Justin Gilmer, Many Others, Xiaohua Zhai, Daniel Keysers, Jeremiah Harmsen, and Neil Houlsby.

A key component in our proposed approach is a new attention technique dubbed Infini-attention. The Infini-attention incorporates a compressive memory into the vanilla attention mechanism and builds in both masked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms in a single Transformer block. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on long-context language modeling benchmarks, 1M sequence length passkey context block retrieval and 500K length book summarization tasks with 1B and 8B LLMs. Our approach introduces minimal bounded memory parameters and enables fast streaming inference for LLMs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/24 (Score: 0.63)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1910.06611, 2019.

Hovy*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experiments conducted on six large scale text classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperform previous methods by a substantial margin.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a hierarchical attention network for document classification. Our model has two distinctive characteristics: (i) it has a hierarchical structure that mirrors the hierarchical structure of documents; (ii) it has two levels of attention mechanisms applied at the wordand sentence-level, enabling it to attend differentially to more and less important content when constructing the document representation. Experiments conducted on six large scale text classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperform previous methods by a substantial margin. Visualization of the attention layers illustrates that the model selects qualitatively informative words and sentences.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 4297  (*Influential: 554*)\n\n#### 2.

FasterViT combines the benefits of fast local representation learning in CNNs and global modeling properties in ViT. Our newly introduced Hierarchical Attention (HAT) approach decomposes global self-attention with quadratic complexity into a multi-level attention with reduced computational costs. We benefit from efficient window-based self-attention. Each window has access to dedicated carrier tokens that participate in local and global representation learning. At a high level, global self-attentions enable the efficient cross-window communication at lower costs. FasterViT achieves a SOTA Pareto-front in terms of accuracy and image throughput. We have extensively validated its effectiveness on various CV tasks including classification, object detection and segmentation. We also show that HAT can be used as a plug-and-play module for existing networks and enhance them. We further demonstrate significantly faster and more accurate performance than competitive counterparts for images with high resolution.

HAHE: Hierarchical Attention for Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs in Global and Local Level\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Attention*\n\n*Haoran Luo, E. Haihong, Yuhao Yang, Yikai Guo, Mingzhi Sun, Tianyu Yao, Zichen Tang, Kaiyang Wan, Meina Song, Wei Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Hierarchical Attention model for HKG Embedding (HAHE), including global-level and local-level attention, that addresses the issue of HKG multi-position prediction for the first time and achieves state-of-the-art performance in link prediction tasks on HKG standard datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Link Prediction on Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKG) is a worthwhile endeavor. HKG consists of hyper-relational facts (H-Facts), composed of a main triple and several auxiliary attribute-value qualifiers, which can effectively represent factually comprehensive information. The internal structure of HKG can be represented as a hypergraph-based representation globally and a semantic sequence-based representation locally. However, existing research seldom simultaneously models the graphical and sequential structure of HKGs, limiting HKGs\u2019 representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Hierarchical Attention model for HKG Embedding (HAHE), including global-level and local-level attention. The global-level attention can model the graphical structure of HKG using hypergraph dual-attention layers, while the local-level attention can learn the sequential structure inside H-Facts via heterogeneous self-attention layers. Experiment results indicate that HAHE achieves state-of-the-art performance in link prediction tasks on HKG standard datasets. In addition, HAHE addresses the issue of HKG multi-position prediction for the first time, increasing the applicability of the HKG link prediction task.

Adaptive Compositional Continual Meta-Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Parameter Sharing*\n\n*Bin Wu, Jinyuan Fang, Xiangxiang Zeng, Shangsong Liang, Qiang Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** An A daptive C ompositional Continual Continual M eta-L earning (ACML) algorithm, which employs a compositional premise to associate a task with a subset of mixture components, allowing meta-knowledge sharing among heterogeneous tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper focuses on continual meta-learning, where few-shot tasks are heterogeneous and sequentially available. Recent works use a mixture model for meta-knowledge to deal with the heterogeneity. However, these methods suffer from parameter inefficiency caused by two reasons: (1) the underlying assumption of mutual exclusiveness among mixture components hinders sharing meta-knowledge across heterogeneous tasks. (2) they only allow increasing mixture components and cannot adaptively filter out redundant components. In this paper, we pro-pose an A daptive C ompositional Continual M eta-L earning (ACML) algorithm, which employs a compositional premise to associate a task with a subset of mixture components, allowing meta-knowledge sharing among heterogeneous tasks. Moreover, to adaptively adjust the number of mixture components, we propose a component spar-sification method based on evidential theory to filter out redundant components. Experimental results show ACML outperforms strong baselines, showing the effectiveness of our compositional meta-knowledge, and confirming that ACML can adaptively learn meta-knowledge.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Continual Sequence Generation with Adaptive Compositional Modules\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Parameter Sharing*\n\n*Yanzhe Zhang, Xuezhi Wang, Diyi Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results show that the proposed continual sequence generation with adaptive compositional modules with pseudo experience replay can adaptively add modules or reuse modules based on task similarity, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both performance and parameter efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Continual learning is essential for real-world deployment when there is a need to quickly adapt the model to new tasks without forgetting knowledge of old tasks. Existing work on continual sequence generation either always reuses existing parameters to learn new tasks, which is vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting on dissimilar tasks, or blindly adds new parameters for every new task, which could prevent knowledge sharing between similar tasks. To get the best of both worlds, in this work, we propose continual sequence generation with adaptive compositional modules to adaptively add modules in transformer architectures and compose both old and new modules for new tasks. We also incorporate pseudo experience replay to facilitate knowledge transfer in those shared modules. Experiment results on various sequences of generation tasks show that our framework can adaptively add modules or reuse modules based on task similarity, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both performance and parameter efficiency.

Conditionally Adaptive Multi-Task Learning: Improving Transfer Learning in NLP Using Fewer Parameters & Less Data\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Parameter Sharing*\n\n*Jonathan Pilault, Amine Elhattami, C. Pal*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel transformer based architecture consisting of a new conditional attention mechanism as well as a set of task conditioned modules that facilitate weight sharing is proposed that is able to surpass single-task fine-tuning methods while being parameter and data efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has emerged as a promising approach for transferring learned knowledge across different tasks. However, multi-task learning must deal with challenges such as: overfitting to low resource tasks, catastrophic forgetting, and negative task transfer, or learning interference. Additionally, in Natural Language Processing (NLP), MTL alone has typically not reached the performance level possible through per-task fine-tuning of pretrained models. However, many fine-tuning approaches are both parameter inefficient, e.g. potentially involving one new model per task, and highly susceptible to losing knowledge acquired during pretraining. We propose a novel transformer based architecture consisting of a new conditional attention mechanism as well as a set of task conditioned modules that facilitate weight sharing. Through this construction we achieve more efficient parameter sharing and mitigate forgetting by keeping half of the weights of a pretrained model fixed. We also use a new multi-task data sampling strategy to mitigate the negative effects of data imbalance across tasks. Using this approach we are able to surpass single-task fine-tuning methods while being parameter and data efficient. With our base model, we attain 2.2% higher performance compared to a full fine-tuned BERT large model on the GLUE benchmark, adding only 5.6% more trained parameters per task (whereas naive fine-tuning potentially adds 100% of the trained parameters per task) and needing only 64.6% of the data. We show that a larger variant of our single multi-task model approach performs competitively across 26 NLP tasks and yields state-of-the-art results on a number of test and development sets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 87  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 7. RMM: Reinforced Memory Management for Class-Incremental Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Management*\n\n*Yaoyao Liu, B. Schiele, Qianru Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [40] trains classi\ufb01ers under a strict memory budget: in each incremental phase, learning is done for new data, most of which is abandoned to free space for the next phase. The preserved data are exemplars used for replaying. However, existing methods use a static and ad hoc strategy for memory allocation, which is often sub-optimal. In this work, we propose a dynamic memory management strategy that is optimized for the incremental phases and different object classes. We call our method reinforced memory management (RMM), leveraging reinforcement learning. RMM training is not naturally compatible with CIL as the past, and future data are strictly non-accessible during the incremental phases. We solve this by training the policy function of RMM on pseudo CIL tasks, e.g., the tasks built on the data of the 0 -th phase, and then applying it to target tasks. RMM propagates two levels of actions: Level-1 determines how to split the memory between old and new classes, and Level-2 allocates memory for each speci\ufb01c class. In essence, it is an optimizable and general method for memory management that can be used in any replaying-based CIL method. For evaluation, we plug RMM into two top-performing baselines (LUCIR+AANets and POD+AANets [30]) and conduct experiments on three benchmarks (CIFAR-100, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full). Our results show clear improvements, e.g., boosting POD+AANets by 3 . 6% , 4 . 4% , and 1 . 9% in the 25 -Phase settings of the above benchmarks, respectively.

Park, Nako Sung*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel task and a corresponding dataset of memory management in long-term conversations are presented, in which bots keep track of and bring up the latest information about users while conversing through multiple sessions, to support more precise and interpretable memory.\n\n**Abstract:** Remembering important information from the past and continuing to talk about it in the present are crucial in long-term conversations. However, previous literature does not deal with cases where the memorized information is outdated, which may cause confusion in later conversations. To address this issue, we present a novel task and a corresponding dataset of memory management in long-term conversations, in which bots keep track of and bring up the latest information about users while conversing through multiple sessions. In order to support more precise and interpretable memory, we represent memory as unstructured text descriptions of key information and propose a new mechanism of memory management that selectively eliminates invalidated or redundant information. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the baselines that leave the stored memory unchanged in terms of engagingness and humanness, with larger performance gap especially in the later sessions.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 4 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

A Hierarchical Attention Based Seq2seq Model for Chinese Lyrics\n  Generation\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Attention*\n\n*Haoshen Fan, Jie Wang, Bojin Zhuang, Shaojun Wang, Jing Xiao*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we comprehensively study on context-aware generation of\nChinese song lyrics. Conventional text generative models generate a sequence or\nsentence word by word, failing to consider the contextual relationship between\nsentences. Taking account into the characteristics of lyrics, a hierarchical\nattention based Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) model is proposed for Chinese\nlyrics generation. With encoding of word-level and sentence-level contextual\ninformation, this model promotes the topic relevance and consistency of\ngeneration. A large Chinese lyrics corpus is also leveraged for model training.\nEventually, results of automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that our\nmodel is able to compose complete Chinese lyrics with one united topic\nconstraint.\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-15T06:58:42Z  (*Updated: 2019-06-15T06:58:42Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. On the Unintended Social Bias of Training Language Generation Models\n  with Data from Local Media\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Management*\n\n*Omar U.

For example, gender bias is a significant problem when\ngenerating text, and its unintended memorization could impact the user\nexperience of many applications (e.g., the smart-compose feature in Gmail).\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture that decouples the\nrepresentation learning of a neural model from its memory management role. This\narchitecture allows us to update a memory module with an equal ratio across\ngender types addressing biased correlations directly in the latent space. We\nexperimentally show that our approach can mitigate the gender bias\namplification in the automatic generation of articles news while providing\nsimilar perplexity values when extending the Sequence2Sequence architecture.\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-01T16:52:02Z  (*Updated: 2019-11-01T16:52:02Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Learning to Ignore: Long Document Coreference with Bounded Memory Neural\n  Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Management*\n\n*Shubham Toshniwal, Sam Wiseman, Allyson Ettinger, Karen Livescu, Kevin Gimpel*\n\n**Abstract:** Long document coreference resolution remains a challenging task due to the\nlarge memory and runtime requirements of current models. Recent work doing\nincremental coreference resolution using just the global representation of\nentities shows practical benefits but requires keeping all entities in memory,\nwhich can be impractical for long documents. We argue that keeping all entities\nin memory is unnecessary, and we propose a memory-augmented neural network that\ntracks only a small bounded number of entities at a time, thus guaranteeing a\nlinear runtime in length of document. We show that (a) the model remains\ncompetitive with models with high memory and computational requirements on\nOntoNotes and LitBank, and (b) the model learns an efficient memory management\nstrategy easily outperforming a rule-based strategy.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-06T15:16:31Z  (*Updated: 2020-11-17T02:31:30Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention for Semantic Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Attention*\n\n*Bryan Catanzaro, Karan Sapra, Andrew Tao*\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-scale inference is commonly used to improve the results of semantic segmentation. Multiple images scales are passed through a network and then the results are combined with averaging or max pooling. In this work, we present an attention-based approach to combining multi-scale predictions. We show that predictions at certain scales are better at resolving particular failures modes, and that the network learns to favor those scales for such cases in order to generate better predictions. Our attention mechanism is hierarchical, which enables it to be roughly 4x more memory efficient to train than other recent approaches. In addition to enabling faster training, this allows us to train with larger crop sizes which leads to greater model accuracy. We demonstrate the result of our method on two datasets: Cityscapes and Mapillary Vistas. For Cityscapes, which has a large number of weakly labelled images, we also leverage auto-labelling to improve generalization. Using our approach we achieve a new state-of-the-art results in both Mapillary (61.1 IOU val) and Cityscapes (85.1 IOU test).\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. HAHE: Hierarchical Attentive Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Attention*\n\n*Jia-Wei Chen, Sheng Zhou, Jiajun Bu, Xin Wang, Can Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Heterogeneous information network (HIN) embedding has recently attracted much attention due to its effectiveness in dealing with the complex heterogeneous data. Meta path, which connects different object types with various semantic meanings, is widely used by existing HIN embedding works. However, several challenges have not been addressed so far. First, different meta paths convey different semantic meanings, while existing works assume that all nodes share same weights for meta paths and ignore the personalized preferences of different nodes on different meta paths. Second, given a meta path, nodes in HIN are connected by path instances while existing works fail to fully explore the differences between path instances that reflect nodes' preferences in the semantic space. rTo tackle the above challenges, we propose aHierarchical Attentive Heterogeneous information network Embedding (HAHE) model to capture the personalized preferences on meta paths and path instances in each semantic space. As path instances are based on a particular meta path, a hierarchical attention mechanism is naturally utilized to model the personalized preference on meta paths and path instances. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets show that our proposed \\model model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of various data mining tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-31\n\n\n\n#### 3. Task Adaptive Parameter Sharing for Multi-Task Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Parameter Sharing*\n\n*Stefano Soatto, Rahul Bhotika, Charless Fowlkes, Avinash Ravichandran, Alessandro Achille, Hao Li, Matthew Wallingford*\n\n**Abstract:** Adapting pre-trained models with broad capabilities has become standard practice for learning a wide range of downstream tasks. The typical approach of fine-tuning different models for each task is performant, but incurs a substantial memory cost. To efficiently learn multiple downstream tasks we introduce Task Adaptive Parameter Sharing (TAPS), a general method for tuning a base model to a new task by adaptively modifying a small, task-specific subset of layers. This enables multi-task learning while minimizing resources used and competition between tasks. TAPS solves a joint optimization problem which determines which layers to share with the base model and the value of the task-specific weights. Further, a sparsity penalty on the number of active layers encourages weight sharing with the base model. Compared to other methods, TAPS retains high accuracy on downstream tasks while introducing few task-specific parameters. Moreover, TAPS is agnostic to the model architecture and requires only minor changes to the training scheme. We evaluate our method on a suite of fine-tuning tasks and architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, ViT) and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance while being simple to implement.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2022-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-30\n\n\n\n#### 4. Going deeper with Image Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Parameter Sharing*\n\n*Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Gabriel Synnaeve, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Matthieu Cord, Hugo Touvron*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have been recently adapted for large scale image classification, achieving high scores shaking up the long supremacy of convolutional neural networks. However the optimization of image transformers has been little studied so far. In this work, we build and optimize deeper transformer networks for image classification. In particular, we investigate the interplay of architecture and optimization of such dedicated transformers. We make two transformers architecture changes that significantly improve the accuracy of deep transformers. This leads us to produce models whose performance does not saturate early with more depth, for instance we obtain 86.5% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet when training with no external data, we thus attain the current SOTA with less FLOPs and parameters. Moreover, our best model establishes the new state of the art on Imagenet with Reassessed labels and Imagenet-V2 / match frequency, in the setting with no additional training data. We share our code and models.\n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-03-31\n\n\n\n#### 5. Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Management*\n\n*Ion Stoica, Hao Zhang, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Cody Hao Yu, Lianmin Zheng, Ying Sheng, Siyuan Zhuang, Zhuohan Li, Woosuk Kwon*\n\n**Abstract:** High throughput serving of large language models (LLMs) requires batching sufficiently many requests at a time. However, existing systems struggle because the key-value cache (KV cache) memory for each request is huge and grows and shrinks dynamically. When managed inefficiently, this memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the batch size. To address this problem, we propose PagedAttention, an attention algorithm inspired by the classical virtual memory and paging techniques in operating systems. On top of it, we build vLLM, an LLM serving system that achieves (1) near-zero waste in KV cache memory and (2) flexible sharing of KV cache within and across requests to further reduce memory usage. Our evaluations show that vLLM improves the throughput of popular LLMs by 2-4$\\times$ with the same level of latency compared to the state-of-the-art systems, such as FasterTransformer and Orca. The improvement is more pronounced with longer sequences, larger models, and more complex decoding algorithms. vLLM's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-12\n\n\n\n#### 6.

Mesh generally\nmatches the runtime performance of state-of-the-art memory allocators while\nreducing memory consumption; in particular, it reduces the memory of\nconsumption of Firefox by 16% and Redis by 39%.\n\n**Published:** 2019-02-13\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model (LM) design, focusing on hierarchical selective attention, dynamic parameter adjustment, and memory-efficient transformer designs, here are some key points and directions for further research:\n\n## Hierarchical Selective Attention\n\n- **Selective Attention Layers (SALs)**: Models like the Taipan model use SALs to reduce computational costs by focusing on key tokens. This hierarchical approach can be explored further to optimize the attention mechanism, ensuring that the model prioritizes relevant tokens while ignoring less important ones. This is similar to the cognitive process of selective attention, where the brain focuses on specific stimuli while ignoring others.\n\n- **Hierarchical Processing**: The concept of hierarchical processing, as seen in the Temporal Latent Bottleneck approach, synthesizes fast and slow processing mechanisms. This can be adapted to create a hierarchical attention structure where different layers or modules focus on different levels of detail or context, enhancing the model's ability to capture complex patterns.\n\n## Dynamic Parameter Adjustment\n\n- **Fine-Tuning Specific Layers**: The E-Tamba approach involves fine-tuning specific layers, which can be a framework for dynamic parameter generation. This method allows for adaptive parameter sharing and adjustment based on the task or input, potentially improving the model's performance and flexibility.\n\n- **Adaptive Parameter Sharing**: Investigate models that use adaptive parameter sharing, such as the Reformer or Gated Linear Attention Transformers. These models adjust parameters dynamically based on the input, which can help in optimizing the model's performance and efficiency.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Transformer Designs\n\n- **Linear Attention and Speculative Decoding**: The integration of linear attention with speculative decoding, as discussed in \"When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding,\" can significantly reduce memory usage during training and serving of LLMs. This approach is crucial for memory management strategies.\n\n- **FlashAttention and Ring Attention**: These attention mechanisms are designed to reduce memory usage while maintaining performance. FlashAttention uses a more efficient algorithm for computing attention weights, and Ring Attention uses a ring structure to reduce the memory footprint. These strategies can be incorporated into the proposed model to enhance its memory efficiency.\n\n- **Feedback Transformer Architecture**: The Feedback Transformer architecture enhances the representation capacity of transformers by incorporating feedback mechanisms. This can be explored to improve memory management by allowing the model to retain and reuse information more efficiently.\n\n## Hybrid Models and Future Directions\n\n- **Combining Different Architectures**: Investigate hybrid models that integrate different architectures, such as combining hierarchical selective attention with dynamic parameter generation and memory-efficient attention mechanisms. For example, integrating the SelectiveGatedMHA proposal with elements from Linformer, Reformer, or Gated Linear Attention Transformers could lead to a more robust and efficient model.\n\n- **Recent Advancements**: Keep an eye on recent advancements in attention mechanisms, such as new selective attention techniques, dynamic parameter generation methods, and innovative memory-efficient implementations. Conferences and journals like ICLR, NeurIPS, and arXiv often feature cutting-edge research in these areas.\n\nBy focusing on these areas and integrating the insights from various sources, the researchers can develop a novel autoregressive LM block that excels in low perplexity, high accuracy in downstream tasks, robustness to variant inputs, efficiency in training and inference, and good scalability.\n",

In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/39 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nRemark 2.1.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 42/46 (Score: 0.69)*\n\n```\n[N/A]\n(b) Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?

This work takes inspiration from a wide array of work on introducing multiple scales of processing into recurrent neural networks (Chung et al. 2016; Hihi \\& Bengio, 1995; Mozer, 1991, Schmidhuber, 1991, Koutn\u00edk et al., 2014). These works divide the processing into multiple streams each operating at a different temporal granularity. While these works mainly focus on recurrent neural networks and their application is mainly on natural language tasks, we focus on introducing multiple streams of processing and a hierarchical structure into Transformers while also focusing on a broader range of domains beyond natural language. Transformers. Some of the components we describe in the proposed model have been used previously in various Transformer models. Transformer XL (Dai et al., 2019) also divides the input into segments. Each segment considers the tokens from the current segment and the previous segment for attention without passing gradients into the previous segments. A number of previous works (Zhang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021b, Wu et al., 2021, Yuan et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021) have worked on introducing a hierarchical structure in Transformers mainly in the domain of vision. The main goal of these works has been to introduce convolution-like hierarchies into Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020). While these works progressively reduce the spatial resolution of the inputs in order to introduce hierarchies, we introduce hierarchies by adding another slow stream of information processing and without reducing the spatial resolution of the inputs. We also provision for the higher level of the hierarchy (i.e. the slow stream) to provide information to the lower levels as top-down conditioning which is not possible in any of the previous works. Top-Down Conditioning. Top-down information is information propagated from higher to lower levels of the network. It represents the models beliefs of the world and provides context for interpreting perceptual information.\n```\n\n#### 5. Addressing Some Limitations of Transformers with Feedback Memory (Avg.

The representation at a given layer can only access representations from lower layers, rather than the higher level representations already available. In this work, we propose the Feedback Transformer architecture that exposes all previous representations to all future representations, meaning the lowest representation of the current timestep is formed from the highest-level abstract representation of the past.

We demonstrate on a variety of benchmarks in language modeling, machine translation, and reinforcement learning that the increased representation capacity can create small, shallow models with much stronger performance than comparable Transformers. ## 1 INTRODUCTION\n\nIn recent years, the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al, 2017) has brought large improvements to a wide range of Natural Language Processing tasks such as machine translation, sentence representation (Devlin et al., 2019), and summarization (Edunov et al., 2019). Transformers are also successfully used as an autoregressive model on sequential tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al. 2019, Rae et al, 2020) and reinforcement learning (Parisotto et al., 2019). Unlike more traditional recurrent architectures such as RNNs and LSTMs, the Transformer architecture processes a sequence in parallel in an order-invariant way. Techniques such as position embeddings (Sukhbaatar et al. 2015, Shaw et al. 2018) and attention masking are required to capture input order information. In this work, we focus on several limitations of the Transformer architecture as an autoregressive model and present a straightforward solution - Feedback memory. These limitations and our proposed solution target sequential token prediction tasks, such as language modeling or other auto-regressive generative tasks. The feedforward nature of Transformers makes them efficient on modern hardware, but restricts the Transformer from taking full advantage of the input's sequential property. In particular, the current hidden representation of a Transformer only accesses the past representations of lower layers, even though higher level representations of the past have already been computed as an autoregressive model. At generation, the Transformer generates only one token at a time, so it could access these representations for better performance, but does not exploit these at training time due to parallelization. However, if these past higher level representations could be used at training time, they would enrich future lower level representations, enabling shallower models to have the same representation power. Another inherent limitation of Transformers on sequential tasks is the lack of recursive computation (Dehghani et al., 2018), and the number of transformations possible on the input is bounded by the model depth. Such disadvantages have impact on tasks that require careful tracking of a world state or modeling hierarchical structures (Tran et al., 2018; Hahn, 2020). On the other hand, while RNNs can maintain an internal state for an unbounded time while accumulating more computations upon it, the size of this internal state is limited by the dimension of the hidden state. In this work, we propose a novel autoregressive model, the Feedback Transformer, that makes all previous hidden representations accessible to the computation of a representation at any depth -\nthe model feeds back previous computations to itself. The feedback allows the model to perform recursive computation, building stronger representations iteratively upon previous states. To achieve this, we modify self-attention to attend to higher level representations rather than lower ones. As shown in Figure 1, the Feedback Transformer merges the hidden states from all layers into a single vector for every time step and stores them in a memory. Instead of self-attention, all subsequent layers attend to this memory, which means every previously computed representation is accessible by all future layers, mediated by the memory. This allows Feedback Transformers to recursively compute and transform an input as many times as the input length, which is something Transformers cannot achieve. While RNNs can perform recursive computation, the amount of information that Feedback Transformers can maintain is not limited by the number of layers. There are computational benefits to this straightforward modification. First, it uses less memory because all the layers share a single Feedback memory, thus reducing the memory size by $L$ times, where $L$ is the number of layers. There is also less computation because we share the key and value projections during attention computation, which increases the speed of the attention over the Feedback Memory. Further, the GPU memory usage is reduced due to the memory sharing - the overall model is 2 x smaller - allowing the batch size to be increased for computational efficiency. During inference, the increased batch size contributes to substantially faster decoding speeds. In summary, our main contributions are: (1) The Feedback Transformer architecture, which completely changes the way a Transformer works to access available higher level representations immediately. (2) We show the Feedback Transformer can achieve state of the art results with smaller, shallower models that have faster decoding speed and smaller memory footprint. (3) The Feedback Transformer uses substantially less memory during training and inference time. ## 2 RELATED WORK\n\nSeveral previous works have analyzed the limitations of Transformer architectures, such as the inability to process input sequentially (Dehghani et al. 2018) or represent hierarchical structure (Tran et al., 2018). Hahn (2020) demonstrate that Transformers cannot model structures involving bounded recursion, such as closing parentheses. P\u00e9rez et al. (2019) study Transformers in the context of Turing machines, where they must produce unbounded numbers of decoding steps. Various work in probing Transformers identified several limitations where Transformers may not have the computational capacity of recurrent architecture like an LSTM (Hahn, 2020). From the architectural perspective, our work shares similarities with recurrent networks augmented with external shared memories (Graves et al., 2014; Joulin \\& Mikolov, 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015). For example, the stack augmented RNN of Joulin \\& Mikolov(2015) adds an external memory to a recurrent network to keep long term dependencies. Closer to our work, the Neural Turing Machine of Graves et al. (2014) models an unconstrained memory that resembles the self-attention layer of a Transformer. Further improvements to recurrent networks, such as the Gated Feedback RNN (Chung et al., 2015), are based on better controlling signal from different layers and extended to feedback through multiple pathways (Jin et al., 2017). These works are built on recurrent networks with additional components to store long term dependencies. Other works have studied modifications to the Transformer architecture by enriching its structure with components inspired by recurrent networks. For example, Wang et al. (2019) propose adding a local recurrent sublayer to the Transformer layer to remove the need for position embeddings in the multi-head self-attention layers. Universal Transformer (Dehghani et al., 2018) share the parameters between the layers of a Transformer, leading a recurrent network in depth.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 20 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: Selective Attention, Dynamic Parameter Generation, Memory Efficient Transformers\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

However, distant supervision inevitably accompanies with the wrong labelling problem, and these noisy data will substantially hurt the performance of relation extraction. To alleviate this issue, we propose a sentence-level attention-based model for relation extraction. In this model, we employ convolutional neural networks to embed the semantics of sentences. Afterwards, we build sentence-level attention over multiple instances, which is expected to dynamically reduce the weights of those noisy instances. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that, our model can make full use of all informative sentences and effectively reduce the in\ufb02uence of wrong labelled instances.

Recent works in context-aware NMT consider only a few previous sentences as context and may not scale to entire documents. To this end, we propose a novel and scalable top-down approach to hierarchical attention for context-aware NMT which uses sparse attention to selectively focus on relevant sentences in the document context and then attends to key words in those sentences. We also propose single-level attention approaches based on sentence or word-level information in the context. The document-level context representation, produced from these attention modules, is integrated into the encoder or decoder of the Transformer model depending on whether we use monolingual or bilingual context. Our experiments and evaluation on English-German datasets in different document MT settings show that our selective attention approach not only significantly outperforms context-agnostic baselines but also surpasses context-aware baselines in most cases.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 166  (*Influential: 31*)\n\n#### 3.

Prior generative approaches which decode slot values sequentially do not generalize well to variations in schema, while discriminative approaches separately encode history and schema and fail to account for inter-slot and intent-slot dependencies. We introduce SPLAT, a novel architecture which achieves better generalization and efficiency than prior approaches by constraining outputs to a limited prediction space. At the same time, our model allows for rich attention among descriptions and history while keeping computation costs constrained by incorporating linear-time attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and MultiWOZ datasets. Our approach significantly improves upon existing models achieving 85.3 JGA on the SGD dataset. Further, we show increased robustness on the SGD-X benchmark: our model outperforms the more than 30x larger D3ST-XXL model by 5.0 points.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Dynamic and Efficient Inference for Text Generation via BERT Family\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Parameter Generation*\n\n*Xiaobo Liang, Juntao Li, Lijun Wu, Ziqiang Cao, M. Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel fine-tuning method DEER, which can make a single pre-trained model support Dynamic and Efficient infERence and achieve an adaptive trade-off between model performance and latency and explores the effectiveness of the pre- trained MLMs for text generation tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the excellent performance of Pre-trained Language Models on many text generation tasks, they suffer from inefficient inference on computation and memory due to their large-scale parameters and the universal autoregressive decoding paradigm. In this work, we propose a novel fine-tuning method DEER, which can make a single pre-trained model support Dynamic and Efficient infERence and achieve an adaptive trade-off between model performance and latency. In particular, our critical insight is to jointly utilize the non-autoregressive (NAR) generation and dynamic parameter pruning techniques, which can flexibly control the decoding iteration steps and model sizes according to memory and latency limitations. Besides, we also explore the effectiveness of the pre-trained MLMs (i.e., the BERT family) for text generation tasks since their bidirectional attention nature is more suitable for the NAR training objective. Extensive experiments on both monolingual and multilingual pre-trained MLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DEER method by consistently achieving (1) higher BLEU scores than the strong autoregressive Transformer model on three neural machine translation tasks with 3 \\to 12 times speedup, (2) competitive performance (but with much faster inference speed) compared with the BART model on four GLGE benchmark tasks.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Parameter Generation*\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6. Lightweight, Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks for AMR-to-Text Generation\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Parameter Generation*\n\n*Yan Zhang, Zhijiang Guo, Zhiyang Teng, Wei Lu, Shay B. Cohen, Zuozhu Liu, Lidong Bing*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs and develops two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** AMR-to-text generation is used to transduce Abstract Meaning Representation structures (AMR) into text. A key challenge in this task is to efficiently learn effective graph representations. Previously, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) were used to encode input AMRs, however, vanilla GCNs are not able to capture non-local information and additionally, they follow a local (first-order) information aggregation scheme. To account for these issues, larger and deeper GCN models are required to capture more complex interactions. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic fusion mechanism, proposing Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs. We further develop two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity. With the help of these strategies, we are able to train a model with fewer parameters while maintaining the model capacity. Experiments demonstrate that LDGCNs outperform state-of-the-art models on two benchmark datasets for AMR-to-text generation with significantly fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 7. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Efficient Transformers*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1345  (*Influential: 135*)\n\n#### 8. Memory Efficient Continual Learning with Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Efficient Transformers*\n\n*B. Ermi\u015f, Giovanni Zappella, Martin Wistuba, Aditya Rawal, C. Archambeau*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper devise a method to incrementally train a model on a sequence of tasks using pre-trained Transformers and extending them with Adapters that is able to scale to a large number of tasks without significant overhead and allows sharing information across tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** In many real-world scenarios, data to train machine learning models becomes available over time. Unfortunately, these models struggle to continually learn new concepts without forgetting what has been learnt in the past. This phenomenon is known as catastrophic forgetting and it is difficult to prevent due to practical constraints. For instance, the amount of data that can be stored or the computational resources that can be used might be limited. Moreover, applications increasingly rely on large pre-trained neural networks, such as pre-trained Transformers, since the resources or data might not be available in sufficiently large quantities to practitioners to train the model from scratch. In this paper, we devise a method to incrementally train a model on a sequence of tasks using pre-trained Transformers and extending them with Adapters. Different than the existing approaches, our method is able to scale to a large number of tasks without significant overhead and allows sharing information across tasks. On both image and text classification tasks, we empirically demonstrate that our method maintains a good predictive performance without retraining the model or increasing the number of model parameters over time. The resulting model is also significantly faster at inference time compared to Adapter-based state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient Attention Manipulation\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Efficient Transformers*\n\n*Mayukh Deb, Bjorn Deiseroth, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, P. Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 5 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Selective Attention Improves Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: Selective Attention*\n\n*Yaniv Leviathan, Matan Kalman, Yossi Matias*\n\n**Abstract:** Unneeded elements in the attention's context degrade performance. We\nintroduce Selective Attention, a simple parameter-free change to the standard\nattention mechanism which reduces attention to unneeded elements. Selective\nattention improves language modeling performance in a variety of model sizes\nand context lengths. For example, a range of transformers trained with the\nlanguage modeling objective on C4 with selective attention perform equivalently\nto standard transformers with ~2X more heads and parameters in their attention\nmodules. Selective attention also allows decreasing the size of the attention's\ncontext buffer, leading to meaningful reductions in the memory and compute\nrequirements during inference. For example, transformers with 100M parameters\ntrained on C4 with context sizes of 512, 1,024, and 2,048 need 16X, 25X, and\n47X less memory for their attention module, respectively, when equipped with\nselective attention, as those without selective attention, with the same\nvalidation perplexity.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-03T17:27:30Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-03T17:27:30Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Cross-relation Cross-bag Attention for Distantly-supervised Relation\n  Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: Selective Attention*\n\n*Yujin Yuan, Liyuan Liu, Siliang Tang, Zhongfei Zhang, Yueting Zhuang, Shiliang Pu, Fei Wu, Xiang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Distant supervision leverages knowledge bases to automatically label\ninstances, thus allowing us to train relation extractor without human\nannotations. However, the generated training data typically contain massive\nnoise, and may result in poor performances with the vanilla supervised\nlearning. In this paper, we propose to conduct multi-instance learning with a\nnovel Cross-relation Cross-bag Selective Attention (C$^2$SA), which leads to\nnoise-robust training for distant supervised relation extractor. Specifically,\nwe employ the sentence-level selective attention to reduce the effect of noisy\nor mismatched sentences, while the correlation among relations were captured to\nimprove the quality of attention weights. Moreover, instead of treating all\nentity-pairs equally, we try to pay more attention to entity-pairs with a\nhigher quality. Similarly, we adopt the selective attention mechanism to\nachieve this goal. Experiments with two types of relation extractor demonstrate\nthe superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art, while\nfurther ablation studies verify our intuitions and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed two techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2018-12-27T03:03:51Z  (*Updated: 2018-12-27T03:03:51Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Improving Distant Supervised Relation Extraction by Dynamic Neural\n  Network\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Parameter Generation*\n\n*Yanjie Gou, Yinjie Lei, Lingqiao Liu, Pingping Zhang, Xi Peng*\n\n**Abstract:** Distant Supervised Relation Extraction (DSRE) is usually formulated as a\nproblem of classifying a bag of sentences that contain two query entities, into\nthe predefined relation classes. Most existing methods consider those relation\nclasses as distinct semantic categories while ignoring their potential\nconnection to query entities. In this paper, we propose to leverage this\nconnection to improve the relation extraction accuracy. Our key ideas are\ntwofold: (1) For sentences belonging to the same relation class, the expression\nstyle, i.e. words choice, can vary according to the query entities. To account\nfor this style shift, the model should adjust its parameters in accordance with\nentity types. (2) Some relation classes are semantically similar, and the\nentity types appear in one relation may also appear in others. Therefore, it\ncan be trained cross different relation classes and further enhance those\nclasses with few samples, i.e., long-tail classes. To unify these two\narguments, we developed a novel Dynamic Neural Network for Relation Extraction\n(DNNRE). The network adopts a novel dynamic parameter generator that\ndynamically generates the network parameters according to the query entity\ntypes and relation classes. By using this mechanism, the network can\nsimultaneously handle the style shift problem and enhance the prediction\naccuracy for long-tail classes. Through our experimental study, we demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method and show that it can achieve superior\nperformance over the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-15T06:31:13Z  (*Updated: 2019-12-13T04:29:41Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Memory-efficient Transformers via Top-$k$ Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Efficient Transformers*\n\n*Ankit Gupta, Guy Dar, Shaya Goodman, David Ciprut, Jonathan Berant*\n\n**Abstract:** Following the success of dot-product attention in Transformers, numerous\napproximations have been recently proposed to address its quadratic complexity\nwith respect to the input length. While these variants are memory and compute\nefficient, it is not possible to directly use them with popular pre-trained\nlanguage models trained using vanilla attention, without an expensive\ncorrective pre-training stage. In this work, we propose a simple yet highly\naccurate approximation for vanilla attention. We process the queries in chunks,\nand for each query, compute the top-$k$ scores with respect to the keys. Our\napproach offers several advantages: (a) its memory usage is linear in the input\nsize, similar to linear attention variants, such as Performer and RFA (b) it is\na drop-in replacement for vanilla attention that does not require any\ncorrective pre-training, and (c) it can also lead to significant memory savings\nin the feed-forward layers after casting them into the familiar query-key-value\nframework. We evaluate the quality of top-$k$ approximation for multi-head\nattention layers on the Long Range Arena Benchmark, and for feed-forward layers\nof T5 and UnifiedQA on multiple QA datasets. We show our approach leads to\naccuracy that is nearly-identical to vanilla attention in multiple setups\nincluding training from scratch, fine-tuning, and zero-shot inference.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-13T02:30:23Z  (*Updated: 2021-06-13T02:30:23Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers\nlimit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in\nutilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in\ncomplex environments. We present a novel approach, Ring Attention with\nBlockwise Transformers (Ring Attention), which leverages blockwise computation\nof self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple\ndevices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the\ncomputation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference\nof sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by\nprior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or\nincurring additional communication and computation overheads.

Sequential Attention for Feature Selection\n\n*From Search Query: Selective Attention*\n\n*Vahab Mirrokni, Gang Fu, Matthew Fahrbach, Lin Chen, Mohammadhossein Bateni, Taisuke Yasuda*\n\n**Abstract:** Feature selection is the problem of selecting a subset of features for a machine learning model that maximizes model quality subject to a budget constraint. For neural networks, prior methods, including those based on $\\ell_1$ regularization, attention, and other techniques, typically select the entire feature subset in one evaluation round, ignoring the residual value of features during selection, i.e., the marginal contribution of a feature given that other features have already been selected. We propose a feature selection algorithm called Sequential Attention that achieves state-of-the-art empirical results for neural networks. This algorithm is based on an efficient one-pass implementation of greedy forward selection and uses attention weights at each step as a proxy for feature importance. We give theoretical insights into our algorithm for linear regression by showing that an adaptation to this setting is equivalent to the classical Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm, and thus inherits all of its provable guarantees. Our theoretical and empirical analyses offer new explanations towards the effectiveness of attention and its connections to overparameterization, which may be of independent interest.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-29\n\n\n\n#### 2. Sequential Attention-based Network for Noetic End-to-End Response Selection\n\n*From Search Query: Selective Attention*\n\n*Qian Chen, Wen Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** The noetic end-to-end response selection challenge as one track in Dialog System Technology Challenges 7 (DSTC7) aims to push the state of the art of utterance classification for real world goal-oriented dialog systems, for which participants need to select the correct next utterances from a set of candidates for the multi-turn context. This paper describes our systems that are ranked the top on both datasets under this challenge, one focused and small (Advising) and the other more diverse and large (Ubuntu). Previous state-of-the-art models use hierarchy-based (utterance-level and token-level) neural networks to explicitly model the interactions among different turns' utterances for context modeling. In this paper, we investigate a sequential matching model based only on chain sequence for multi-turn response selection. Our results demonstrate that the potentials of sequential matching approaches have not yet been fully exploited in the past for multi-turn response selection. In addition to ranking the top in the challenge, the proposed model outperforms all previous models, including state-of-the-art hierarchy-based models, and achieves new state-of-the-art performances on two large-scale public multi-turn response selection benchmark datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-09\n\n\n\n#### 3. Joint Parameter Discovery and Generative Modeling of Dynamic Systems\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Parameter Generation*\n\n*Tzikang Chen, Mulugeta A. Haile, Gregory Barber*\n\n**Abstract:** Given an unknown dynamic system such as a coupled harmonic oscillator with $n$ springs and point masses. We are often interested in gaining insights into its physical parameters, i.e. stiffnesses and masses, by observing trajectories of motion. How do we achieve this from video frames or time-series data and without the knowledge of the dynamics model? We present a neural framework for estimating physical parameters in a manner consistent with the underlying physics. The neural framework uses a deep latent variable model to disentangle the system physical parameters from canonical coordinate observations. It then returns a Hamiltonian parameterization that generalizes well with respect to the discovered physical parameters. We tested our framework with simple harmonic oscillators, $n=1$, and noisy observations and show that it discovers the underlying system parameters and generalizes well with respect to these discovered parameters. Our model also extrapolates the dynamics of the system beyond the training interval and outperforms a non-physically constrained baseline model.

ConvBERT: Improving BERT with Span-based Dynamic Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Parameter Generation*\n\n*Zi-Hang Jiang, Yunpeng Chen, Weihao Yu, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan, Daquan Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models like BERT and its variants have recently achieved impressive performance in various natural language understanding tasks. However, BERT heavily relies on the global self-attention block and thus suffers large memory footprint and computation cost. Although all its attention heads query on the whole input sequence for generating the attention map from a global perspective, we observe some heads only need to learn local dependencies, which means the existence of computation redundancy. We therefore propose a novel span-based dynamic convolution to replace these self-attention heads to directly model local dependencies. The novel convolution heads, together with the rest self-attention heads, form a new mixed attention block that is more efficient at both global and local context learning. We equip BERT with this mixed attention design and build a ConvBERT model. Experiments have shown that ConvBERT significantly outperforms BERT and its variants in various downstream tasks, with lower training cost and fewer model parameters. Remarkably, ConvBERTbase model achieves 86.4 GLUE score, 0.7 higher than ELECTRAbase, while using less than 1/4 training cost.

EfficientViT: Memory Efficient Vision Transformer with Cascaded Group Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Efficient Transformers*\n\n*Yixuan Yuan, Han Hu, Yuqing Yang, Ningxin Zheng, Houwen Peng, Xinyu Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers have shown great success due to their high model capabilities. However, their remarkable performance is accompanied by heavy computation costs, which makes them unsuitable for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a family of high-speed vision transformers named EfficientViT. We find that the speed of existing transformer models is commonly bounded by memory inefficient operations, especially the tensor reshaping and element-wise functions in MHSA. Therefore, we design a new building block with a sandwich layout, i.e., using a single memory-bound MHSA between efficient FFN layers, which improves memory efficiency while enhancing channel communication. Moreover, we discover that the attention maps share high similarities across heads, leading to computational redundancy. To address this, we present a cascaded group attention module feeding attention heads with different splits of the full feature, which not only saves computation cost but also improves attention diversity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate EfficientViT outperforms existing efficient models, striking a good trade-off between speed and accuracy. For instance, our EfficientViT-M5 surpasses MobileNetV3-Large by 1.9% in accuracy, while getting 40.4% and 45.2% higher throughput on Nvidia V100 GPU and Intel Xeon CPU, respectively. Compared to the recent efficient model MobileViT-XXS, EfficientViT-M2 achieves 1.8% superior accuracy, while running 5.8x/3.7x faster on the GPU/CPU, and 7.4x faster when converted to ONNX format.

H3T: Efficient Integration of Memory Optimization and Parallelism for Large-scale Transformer Training\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Efficient Transformers*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, big models based on Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many artificial intelligence (AI) tasks.\nDespite the success of these Transformer-based models, their huge parameter size poses a serious challenge to their training, both from the storage and computation perspectives.\nTo this end, memory optimization (e.g., rematerialization and offloading) and parallelism (e.g., data parallelism and model parallelism) are widely explored to make training Transformers more efficient.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework to automatically find an efficient integration of memory optimization and parallelism for High-Throughput Transformer Training (named H3T), which is rarely considered by existing efforts for training big Transformer-based models.\nSpecifically, we design search algorithms to combine appropriate memory optimization strategies and parallelism schemes to achieve a balance between memory overhead and training efficiency.\nWe implement H3T based on an open-source toolkit BMTrain and then use H3T to train the Transformers of different sizes to evaluate the efficiency of H3T.\nThe experimental results show that H3T outperforms the most popular deep learning (DL) toolkit Megatron-DeepSpeed by $1.2\\times \\sim 4.3\\times$ training speed while reducing $34.6\\% \\sim 80.5\\%$ of memory overhead.\nMoreover, H3T can use only 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs to train GPT-3-175B, which is very difficult for existing DL toolkits. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMTrain/tree/h3t.Submission Number: 3012\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2023-11\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model incorporating hierarchical selective attention, dynamic parameter generation, and memory-efficient implementation, here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided sources and the detailed analysis:\n\n## Hierarchical Selective Attention\n\n- The concept of **Selective Attention Layers (SALs)** in the Taipan model is particularly relevant. SALs strategically select key tokens in the input sequence, refining their features and passing them through an attention module to capture long-range dependencies. This approach reduces computational costs by focusing attention on a subset of important tokens, which aligns with the hierarchical selective attention goal.\n\n## Dynamic Parameter Generation\n\n- The idea of **dynamic parameter generation** can be linked to the concept of fine-tuning specific layers or blocks in pre-trained models. The E-Tamba approach, for instance, involves fine-tuning only critical layers of a hybrid Transformer-Mamba model, which can be seen as a form of dynamic parameter adjustment. This method allows for efficient adaptation of model parameters without extensive pre-training.\n\n## Memory Management in Transformers\n\n- **Memory Efficiency** is a key aspect addressed in several recent works. The E-Tamba model, for example, achieves significant memory savings by replacing non-critical upper Transformer layers with Mamba layers, resulting in nearly 3X memory savings compared to traditional Transformer models.\n\n- **Taipan** also offers a memory-efficient solution by using SALs and a sliding window attention mechanism. This design ensures linear memory usage, similar to State Space Models (SSMs), and allows the model to handle extremely long sequences efficiently.\n\n## Comparison and Novelty\n\n- To assess the novelty and potential advantages of the proposed SelectiveGatedMHA, it is crucial to compare it with existing models like **Linformer**, **Reformer**, and **Gated Linear Attention Transformers**. These models have introduced linear attention mechanisms and gating mechanisms that reduce computational complexity and memory usage.\n\n## Efficiency and Scalability\n\n- The **Block Selective Reprogramming (BSR)** approach for vision transformers can provide insights into efficient fine-tuning methods. BSR selectively trains a small fraction of blocks in a pre-trained model, coupled with token dropping, which reduces training memory and computational costs significantly. This method could be adapted or inspired for language models to achieve similar efficiency gains.\n\n## Robustness and Adaptivity\n\n- The **Taipan** model's use of SALs and adaptive gating mechanisms ensures robustness in handling diverse input sequences. By dynamically determining which tokens should undergo attention processing, Taipan balances computational efficiency with the ability to capture important long-range dependencies.\n\n## Implementation Complexity\n\n- The complexity of integrating new components such as the Selective Gate Module, Dynamic Parameter Generator, and Hierarchical Memory Manager should be evaluated. The E-Tamba approach, which involves layer-wise importance analysis and fine-tuning, provides a feasible method for integrating hybrid models without extensive pre-training, which could simplify the implementation process.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n- **External Search**: Continue to explore recent advancements in attention mechanisms, focusing on selective attention, dynamic parameter generation, and memory-efficient implementations. Look into works on hybrid models like Jamba, Zamba, and Griffin, which integrate different architectures to achieve better performance and efficiency.\n\n- **Internal Search**: Delve deeper into existing literature on hierarchical attention and adaptive parameter sharing. Analyze how models like Linformer, Reformer, and Gated Linear Attention Transformers achieve their efficiency and how these mechanisms can be adapted or combined with the proposed SelectiveGatedMHA.\n\nBy integrating these concepts and comparing them with existing state-of-the-art models, the researcher can develop a novel autoregressive language model that excels in hierarchical selective attention, dynamic parameter generation, and memory-efficient implementation.\n",

Many of these efficient transformer variants use some form of nonuniform or local attention mechanisms or a combination thereof. For example, LongFormer (Beltagy et al., 2020) makes use\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_919c88d12b3772ebde65g-30.jpg?height=2021&width=957&top_left_y=361&top_left_x=584)\n\nFigure 10: Eagle Overall Architecture. of the sliding window attention and BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020) adopts randomized sparse and random attention patterns to approximate full attention. Similar examples also include LongT5 (Guo et al., 2022) and StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023). Instead of using fixed patterns, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2019) and Sparse Sinkhorn attention (Tay et al., 2020) learn to dynamically pay attention to selected tokens.Variants including Linformer (Wang et al., 2020), Nystr\u00f6mformer (Xiong et al., 2021) and Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) apply matrix approximation methods to approximate the full attention matrix but with lower computational complexity. The Attention Free Transformer (AFT) (Zhai et al., 2021) introduces a modified form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020a) , where the number of attention heads is equal to the size of the feature dimension. It also incorporates a set of learned pairwise positional biases, denoted as $w$. The AFT can be conceptualized as calculating a per-channel weighted average of values. The weight for a specific location is determined by the sum of the key at that location and the corresponding learned positional bias. Token-shift, as first seen in RWKV-4, is a learned per-channel linear interpolation between the current input and the input at the previous time step, intended to enhance the model with a computationally inexpensive mechanism for choosing between new versus older information within various embedding sub-spaces and for forming induction heads even within a single layer. It is instructive to compare token-shift to a 1D convolution with kernel length 2, as it operates in a similar manner but reuses its parameters via an enforced linear relationship. Recent SSMs have begun using short convolutions in a similar placement within their architectures, typically with kernel length 3 to 4. (Poli et al., 2023; Gu \\& Dao, 2023)\n\nRetentive Networks (RetNet) (Sun et al., 2023) introduces a fixed decay rate schedule and xPos (Sun et al., 2022) to linear attention. This design combines positional information with an inductive bias towards recency while still allowing both RNN and parallel implementations.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Though several specific transformer architectures have been designed to tackle issues of long-range dependencies, existing methods like Transformer-XL are plagued by a high percentage of ineffective memories. In this study, we present a plug-and-play strategy, known as TRAining-free Memory Selection (TRAMS), that selects tokens participating in attention calculation based on one simple metric. This strategy allows us to keep tokens that are likely to have a high attention score with the current queries and ignore the other ones. We have tested our approach on the word-level benchmark (WikiText-103) and the character-level benchmark (enwik8), and the results indicate an improvement without having additional training or adding additional parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/16 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nSainbayar Sukhbaatar, Da Ju, Spencer Poff, Stephen Roller, Arthur Szlam, Jason Weston, and Angela Fan. 2021.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/29 (Score: 0.76)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.05254, 2024b.

However, existing methods struggle with either computational complexity or model expressivity, rendering the maximum sequence length restricted. In this work, we introduce LongNet, a Transformer variant that can scale sequence length to more than 1 billion tokens, without sacrificing the performance on shorter sequences. Specifically, we propose dilated attention, which expands the attentive field exponentially as the distance grows. LongNet has significant advantages: 1) it has a linear computation complexity and a logarithm dependency between tokens; 2) it can be served as a distributed trainer for extremely long sequences; 3) its dilated attention is a drop-in replacement for standard attention, which can be seamlessly integrated with the existing Transformer-based optimization. Experiments results demonstrate that LongNet yields strong performance on both long-sequence modeling and general language tasks. Our work opens up new possibilities for modeling very long sequences, e.g., treating a whole corpus or even the entire Internet as a sequence.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/20 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2204.02311, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DDM}^{+}\\right.$23] Mostafa Dehghani, Josip Djolonga, Basil Mustafa, Piotr Padlewski, Jonathan Heek, Justin Gilmer, Many Others, Xiaohua Zhai, Daniel Keysers, Jeremiah Harmsen, and Neil Houlsby.

FasterViT combines the benefits of fast local representation learning in CNNs and global modeling properties in ViT. Our newly introduced Hierarchical Attention (HAT) approach decomposes global self-attention with quadratic complexity into a multi-level attention with reduced computational costs. We benefit from efficient window-based self-attention. Each window has access to dedicated carrier tokens that participate in local and global representation learning. At a high level, global self-attentions enable the efficient cross-window communication at lower costs. FasterViT achieves a SOTA Pareto-front in terms of accuracy and image throughput. We have extensively validated its effectiveness on various CV tasks including classification, object detection and segmentation. We also show that HAT can be used as a plug-and-play module for existing networks and enhance them. We further demonstrate significantly faster and more accurate performance than competitive counterparts for images with high resolution.

Haihong, Yuhao Yang, Yikai Guo, Mingzhi Sun, Tianyu Yao, Zichen Tang, Kaiyang Wan, Meina Song, Wei Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Hierarchical Attention model for HKG Embedding (HAHE), including global-level and local-level attention, that addresses the issue of HKG multi-position prediction for the first time and achieves state-of-the-art performance in link prediction tasks on HKG standard datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Link Prediction on Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKG) is a worthwhile endeavor. HKG consists of hyper-relational facts (H-Facts), composed of a main triple and several auxiliary attribute-value qualifiers, which can effectively represent factually comprehensive information. The internal structure of HKG can be represented as a hypergraph-based representation globally and a semantic sequence-based representation locally. However, existing research seldom simultaneously models the graphical and sequential structure of HKGs, limiting HKGs\u2019 representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Hierarchical Attention model for HKG Embedding (HAHE), including global-level and local-level attention. The global-level attention can model the graphical structure of HKG using hypergraph dual-attention layers, while the local-level attention can learn the sequential structure inside H-Facts via heterogeneous self-attention layers. Experiment results indicate that HAHE achieves state-of-the-art performance in link prediction tasks on HKG standard datasets. In addition, HAHE addresses the issue of HKG multi-position prediction for the first time, increasing the applicability of the HKG link prediction task.

Adaptive Compositional Continual Meta-Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Parameter Sharing*\n\n*Bin Wu, Jinyuan Fang, Xiangxiang Zeng, Shangsong Liang, Qiang Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** An A daptive C ompositional Continual Continual M eta-L earning (ACML) algorithm, which employs a compositional premise to associate a task with a subset of mixture components, allowing meta-knowledge sharing among heterogeneous tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper focuses on continual meta-learning, where few-shot tasks are heterogeneous and sequentially available. Recent works use a mixture model for meta-knowledge to deal with the heterogeneity. However, these methods suffer from parameter inefficiency caused by two reasons: (1) the underlying assumption of mutual exclusiveness among mixture components hinders sharing meta-knowledge across heterogeneous tasks. (2) they only allow increasing mixture components and cannot adaptively filter out redundant components. In this paper, we pro-pose an A daptive C ompositional Continual M eta-L earning (ACML) algorithm, which employs a compositional premise to associate a task with a subset of mixture components, allowing meta-knowledge sharing among heterogeneous tasks. Moreover, to adaptively adjust the number of mixture components, we propose a component spar-sification method based on evidential theory to filter out redundant components. Experimental results show ACML outperforms strong baselines, showing the effectiveness of our compositional meta-knowledge, and confirming that ACML can adaptively learn meta-knowledge.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Continual Sequence Generation with Adaptive Compositional Modules\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Parameter Sharing*\n\n*Yanzhe Zhang, Xuezhi Wang, Diyi Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results show that the proposed continual sequence generation with adaptive compositional modules with pseudo experience replay can adaptively add modules or reuse modules based on task similarity, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both performance and parameter efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Continual learning is essential for real-world deployment when there is a need to quickly adapt the model to new tasks without forgetting knowledge of old tasks. Existing work on continual sequence generation either always reuses existing parameters to learn new tasks, which is vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting on dissimilar tasks, or blindly adds new parameters for every new task, which could prevent knowledge sharing between similar tasks. To get the best of both worlds, in this work, we propose continual sequence generation with adaptive compositional modules to adaptively add modules in transformer architectures and compose both old and new modules for new tasks. We also incorporate pseudo experience replay to facilitate knowledge transfer in those shared modules. Experiment results on various sequences of generation tasks show that our framework can adaptively add modules or reuse modules based on task similarity, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both performance and parameter efficiency.

Conditionally Adaptive Multi-Task Learning: Improving Transfer Learning in NLP Using Fewer Parameters & Less Data\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Parameter Sharing*\n\n*Jonathan Pilault, Amine Elhattami, C. Pal*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel transformer based architecture consisting of a new conditional attention mechanism as well as a set of task conditioned modules that facilitate weight sharing is proposed that is able to surpass single-task fine-tuning methods while being parameter and data efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has emerged as a promising approach for transferring learned knowledge across different tasks. However, multi-task learning must deal with challenges such as: overfitting to low resource tasks, catastrophic forgetting, and negative task transfer, or learning interference. Additionally, in Natural Language Processing (NLP), MTL alone has typically not reached the performance level possible through per-task fine-tuning of pretrained models. However, many fine-tuning approaches are both parameter inefficient, e.g. potentially involving one new model per task, and highly susceptible to losing knowledge acquired during pretraining. We propose a novel transformer based architecture consisting of a new conditional attention mechanism as well as a set of task conditioned modules that facilitate weight sharing. Through this construction we achieve more efficient parameter sharing and mitigate forgetting by keeping half of the weights of a pretrained model fixed. We also use a new multi-task data sampling strategy to mitigate the negative effects of data imbalance across tasks. Using this approach we are able to surpass single-task fine-tuning methods while being parameter and data efficient. With our base model, we attain 2.2% higher performance compared to a full fine-tuned BERT large model on the GLUE benchmark, adding only 5.6% more trained parameters per task (whereas naive fine-tuning potentially adds 100% of the trained parameters per task) and needing only 64.6% of the data. We show that a larger variant of our single multi-task model approach performs competitively across 26 NLP tasks and yields state-of-the-art results on a number of test and development sets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 87  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 7. RMM: Reinforced Memory Management for Class-Incremental Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Management*\n\n*Yaoyao Liu, B. Schiele, Qianru Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [40] trains classi\ufb01ers under a strict memory budget: in each incremental phase, learning is done for new data, most of which is abandoned to free space for the next phase. The preserved data are exemplars used for replaying. However, existing methods use a static and ad hoc strategy for memory allocation, which is often sub-optimal. In this work, we propose a dynamic memory management strategy that is optimized for the incremental phases and different object classes. We call our method reinforced memory management (RMM), leveraging reinforcement learning. RMM training is not naturally compatible with CIL as the past, and future data are strictly non-accessible during the incremental phases. We solve this by training the policy function of RMM on pseudo CIL tasks, e.g., the tasks built on the data of the 0 -th phase, and then applying it to target tasks. RMM propagates two levels of actions: Level-1 determines how to split the memory between old and new classes, and Level-2 allocates memory for each speci\ufb01c class. In essence, it is an optimizable and general method for memory management that can be used in any replaying-based CIL method. For evaluation, we plug RMM into two top-performing baselines (LUCIR+AANets and POD+AANets [30]) and conduct experiments on three benchmarks (CIFAR-100, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full). Our results show clear improvements, e.g., boosting POD+AANets by 3 . 6% , 4 . 4% , and 1 . 9% in the 25 -Phase settings of the above benchmarks, respectively.

Park, Nako Sung*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel task and a corresponding dataset of memory management in long-term conversations are presented, in which bots keep track of and bring up the latest information about users while conversing through multiple sessions, to support more precise and interpretable memory.\n\n**Abstract:** Remembering important information from the past and continuing to talk about it in the present are crucial in long-term conversations. However, previous literature does not deal with cases where the memorized information is outdated, which may cause confusion in later conversations. To address this issue, we present a novel task and a corresponding dataset of memory management in long-term conversations, in which bots keep track of and bring up the latest information about users while conversing through multiple sessions. In order to support more precise and interpretable memory, we represent memory as unstructured text descriptions of key information and propose a new mechanism of memory management that selectively eliminates invalidated or redundant information. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the baselines that leave the stored memory unchanged in terms of engagingness and humanness, with larger performance gap especially in the later sessions.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 4 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

A Hierarchical Attention Based Seq2seq Model for Chinese Lyrics\n  Generation\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Attention*\n\n*Haoshen Fan, Jie Wang, Bojin Zhuang, Shaojun Wang, Jing Xiao*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we comprehensively study on context-aware generation of\nChinese song lyrics. Conventional text generative models generate a sequence or\nsentence word by word, failing to consider the contextual relationship between\nsentences. Taking account into the characteristics of lyrics, a hierarchical\nattention based Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) model is proposed for Chinese\nlyrics generation. With encoding of word-level and sentence-level contextual\ninformation, this model promotes the topic relevance and consistency of\ngeneration.

On the Unintended Social Bias of Training Language Generation Models\n  with Data from Local Media\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Management*\n\n*Omar U.

For example, gender bias is a significant problem when\ngenerating text, and its unintended memorization could impact the user\nexperience of many applications (e.g., the smart-compose feature in Gmail).\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture that decouples the\nrepresentation learning of a neural model from its memory management role. This\narchitecture allows us to update a memory module with an equal ratio across\ngender types addressing biased correlations directly in the latent space. We\nexperimentally show that our approach can mitigate the gender bias\namplification in the automatic generation of articles news while providing\nsimilar perplexity values when extending the Sequence2Sequence architecture.\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-01T16:52:02Z  (*Updated: 2019-11-01T16:52:02Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Learning to Ignore: Long Document Coreference with Bounded Memory Neural\n  Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Management*\n\n*Shubham Toshniwal, Sam Wiseman, Allyson Ettinger, Karen Livescu, Kevin Gimpel*\n\n**Abstract:** Long document coreference resolution remains a challenging task due to the\nlarge memory and runtime requirements of current models. Recent work doing\nincremental coreference resolution using just the global representation of\nentities shows practical benefits but requires keeping all entities in memory,\nwhich can be impractical for long documents. We argue that keeping all entities\nin memory is unnecessary, and we propose a memory-augmented neural network that\ntracks only a small bounded number of entities at a time, thus guaranteeing a\nlinear runtime in length of document. We show that (a) the model remains\ncompetitive with models with high memory and computational requirements on\nOntoNotes and LitBank, and (b) the model learns an efficient memory management\nstrategy easily outperforming a rule-based strategy.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-06T15:16:31Z  (*Updated: 2020-11-17T02:31:30Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention for Semantic Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Attention*\n\n*Bryan Catanzaro, Karan Sapra, Andrew Tao*\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-scale inference is commonly used to improve the results of semantic segmentation. Multiple images scales are passed through a network and then the results are combined with averaging or max pooling. In this work, we present an attention-based approach to combining multi-scale predictions. We show that predictions at certain scales are better at resolving particular failures modes, and that the network learns to favor those scales for such cases in order to generate better predictions. Our attention mechanism is hierarchical, which enables it to be roughly 4x more memory efficient to train than other recent approaches. In addition to enabling faster training, this allows us to train with larger crop sizes which leads to greater model accuracy. We demonstrate the result of our method on two datasets: Cityscapes and Mapillary Vistas. For Cityscapes, which has a large number of weakly labelled images, we also leverage auto-labelling to improve generalization. Using our approach we achieve a new state-of-the-art results in both Mapillary (61.1 IOU val) and Cityscapes (85.1 IOU test).\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. HAHE: Hierarchical Attentive Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Attention*\n\n*Jia-Wei Chen, Sheng Zhou, Jiajun Bu, Xin Wang, Can Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Heterogeneous information network (HIN) embedding has recently attracted much attention due to its effectiveness in dealing with the complex heterogeneous data. Meta path, which connects different object types with various semantic meanings, is widely used by existing HIN embedding works. However, several challenges have not been addressed so far. First, different meta paths convey different semantic meanings, while existing works assume that all nodes share same weights for meta paths and ignore the personalized preferences of different nodes on different meta paths. Second, given a meta path, nodes in HIN are connected by path instances while existing works fail to fully explore the differences between path instances that reflect nodes' preferences in the semantic space. rTo tackle the above challenges, we propose aHierarchical Attentive Heterogeneous information network Embedding (HAHE) model to capture the personalized preferences on meta paths and path instances in each semantic space. As path instances are based on a particular meta path, a hierarchical attention mechanism is naturally utilized to model the personalized preference on meta paths and path instances. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets show that our proposed \\model model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of various data mining tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-31\n\n\n\n#### 3. Task Adaptive Parameter Sharing for Multi-Task Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Parameter Sharing*\n\n*Stefano Soatto, Rahul Bhotika, Charless Fowlkes, Avinash Ravichandran, Alessandro Achille, Hao Li, Matthew Wallingford*\n\n**Abstract:** Adapting pre-trained models with broad capabilities has become standard practice for learning a wide range of downstream tasks. The typical approach of fine-tuning different models for each task is performant, but incurs a substantial memory cost. To efficiently learn multiple downstream tasks we introduce Task Adaptive Parameter Sharing (TAPS), a general method for tuning a base model to a new task by adaptively modifying a small, task-specific subset of layers. This enables multi-task learning while minimizing resources used and competition between tasks. TAPS solves a joint optimization problem which determines which layers to share with the base model and the value of the task-specific weights. Further, a sparsity penalty on the number of active layers encourages weight sharing with the base model. Compared to other methods, TAPS retains high accuracy on downstream tasks while introducing few task-specific parameters. Moreover, TAPS is agnostic to the model architecture and requires only minor changes to the training scheme. We evaluate our method on a suite of fine-tuning tasks and architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, ViT) and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance while being simple to implement.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2022-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-30\n\n\n\n#### 4. Going deeper with Image Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Parameter Sharing*\n\n*Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Gabriel Synnaeve, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Matthieu Cord, Hugo Touvron*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have been recently adapted for large scale image classification, achieving high scores shaking up the long supremacy of convolutional neural networks. However the optimization of image transformers has been little studied so far. In this work, we build and optimize deeper transformer networks for image classification. In particular, we investigate the interplay of architecture and optimization of such dedicated transformers. We make two transformers architecture changes that significantly improve the accuracy of deep transformers. This leads us to produce models whose performance does not saturate early with more depth, for instance we obtain 86.5% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet when training with no external data, we thus attain the current SOTA with less FLOPs and parameters. Moreover, our best model establishes the new state of the art on Imagenet with Reassessed labels and Imagenet-V2 / match frequency, in the setting with no additional training data. We share our code and models.\n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-03-31\n\n\n\n#### 5. Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Management*\n\n*Ion Stoica, Hao Zhang, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Cody Hao Yu, Lianmin Zheng, Ying Sheng, Siyuan Zhuang, Zhuohan Li, Woosuk Kwon*\n\n**Abstract:** High throughput serving of large language models (LLMs) requires batching sufficiently many requests at a time. However, existing systems struggle because the key-value cache (KV cache) memory for each request is huge and grows and shrinks dynamically. When managed inefficiently, this memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the batch size. To address this problem, we propose PagedAttention, an attention algorithm inspired by the classical virtual memory and paging techniques in operating systems. On top of it, we build vLLM, an LLM serving system that achieves (1) near-zero waste in KV cache memory and (2) flexible sharing of KV cache within and across requests to further reduce memory usage. Our evaluations show that vLLM improves the throughput of popular LLMs by 2-4$\\times$ with the same level of latency compared to the state-of-the-art systems, such as FasterTransformer and Orca. The improvement is more pronounced with longer sequences, larger models, and more complex decoding algorithms. vLLM's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-12\n\n\n\n#### 6.

Models like the Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Memory Augmentation Network (DSTMAN) use multi-head temporal attention modules to capture hierarchical temporal dependencies, which can be adapted for language models to handle long-range dependencies and contextual information.\n\n- The use of selective attention layers, as mentioned in the analysis, can be further explored. For example, the Taipan model's Selective Attention Layers (SALs) could be integrated into autoregressive models to selectively focus on important tokens, thus reducing computational overhead.\n\n## Adaptive Parameter Sharing\n\n- The Kaleidoscope approach in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) introduces a novel adaptive partial parameter sharing scheme that could be adapted for language models. This method uses learnable masks to dictate parameter sharing, promoting policy diversity and efficiency. Applying a similar concept to language models could allow for dynamic adjustment of parameters based on the context, enhancing the model's adaptability and performance.\n\n- The idea of adaptive parameter sharing can also be linked to the dynamic parameter generation concept mentioned in the analysis. Fine-tuning specific layers, as in the E-Tamba approach, can be integrated with learnable masks to achieve dynamic parameter adjustment, which could be beneficial for handling diverse linguistic contexts.\n\n## Memory Management and Efficient Transformer Designs\n\n- Memory-efficient transformer designs are essential for large language models. Techniques like FlashAttention and Ring Attention, which reduce memory usage while maintaining performance, can be explored further. These methods optimize the attention mechanism to use less memory, making them suitable for large-scale models.\n\n- The concept of non-differentiable memory, as discussed in \"Memorizing Transformers,\" can be applied to improve language modeling. Using memory-efficient approaches, such as those involving feedback memory or temporal latent bottlenecks, can enhance the representation capacity of transformers without significantly increasing memory usage.\n\n- The Feedback Transformer architecture, which enhances representation capacity through feedback memory, is another relevant approach. This architecture can be integrated into autoregressive models to improve their ability to handle long-term dependencies and contextual information efficiently.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- **Hybrid Models**: Investigating hybrid models that combine different architectures can be beneficial. For example, integrating the hierarchical attention mechanisms from models like DSTMAN with the adaptive parameter sharing schemes from Kaleidoscope, and incorporating memory-efficient designs from FlashAttention or Ring Attention, could lead to a highly efficient and effective autoregressive language model.\n\n- **Knowledge Management**: The concept of knowledge spaces from the Cognitive Learning Unit (CLU) framework, which involves dynamic and trainable memory stores, can be adapted to enhance the memory management in language models. This could help in retaining general knowledge while adapting to task-specific details, similar to how CLU handles task-specific and general knowledge.\n\nBy combining these insights, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that leverages hierarchical attention, adaptive parameter sharing, and memory-efficient designs to achieve better performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 42/46 (Score: 0.69)*\n\n```\n[N/A]\n(b) Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?

This work takes inspiration from a wide array of work on introducing multiple scales of processing into recurrent neural networks (Chung et al. 2016; Hihi \\& Bengio, 1995; Mozer, 1991, Schmidhuber, 1991, Koutn\u00edk et al., 2014). These works divide the processing into multiple streams each operating at a different temporal granularity. While these works mainly focus on recurrent neural networks and their application is mainly on natural language tasks, we focus on introducing multiple streams of processing and a hierarchical structure into Transformers while also focusing on a broader range of domains beyond natural language. Transformers. Some of the components we describe in the proposed model have been used previously in various Transformer models. Transformer XL (Dai et al., 2019) also divides the input into segments. Each segment considers the tokens from the current segment and the previous segment for attention without passing gradients into the previous segments. A number of previous works (Zhang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021b, Wu et al., 2021, Yuan et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021) have worked on introducing a hierarchical structure in Transformers mainly in the domain of vision. The main goal of these works has been to introduce convolution-like hierarchies into Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020). While these works progressively reduce the spatial resolution of the inputs in order to introduce hierarchies, we introduce hierarchies by adding another slow stream of information processing and without reducing the spatial resolution of the inputs. We also provision for the higher level of the hierarchy (i.e. the slow stream) to provide information to the lower levels as top-down conditioning which is not possible in any of the previous works. Top-Down Conditioning. Top-down information is information propagated from higher to lower levels of the network. It represents the models beliefs of the world and provides context for interpreting perceptual information.\n```\n\n#### 4. Addressing Some Limitations of Transformers with Feedback Memory (Avg.

Unlike recurrent neural networks, Transformers use attention to capture temporal relations while processing input tokens in parallel. While this parallelization makes them computationally efficient, it restricts the model from fully exploiting the sequential nature of the input. The representation at a given layer can only access representations from lower layers, rather than the higher level representations already available. In this work, we propose the Feedback Transformer architecture that exposes all previous representations to all future representations, meaning the lowest representation of the current timestep is formed from the highest-level abstract representation of the past. We demonstrate on a variety of benchmarks in language modeling, machine translation, and reinforcement learning that the increased representation capacity can create small, shallow models with much stronger performance than comparable Transformers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/30 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\nWhile this parallelization makes them computationally efficient, it restricts the model from fully exploiting the sequential nature of the input.

We demonstrate on a variety of benchmarks in language modeling, machine translation, and reinforcement learning that the increased representation capacity can create small, shallow models with much stronger performance than comparable Transformers. ## 1 INTRODUCTION\n\nIn recent years, the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al, 2017) has brought large improvements to a wide range of Natural Language Processing tasks such as machine translation, sentence representation (Devlin et al., 2019), and summarization (Edunov et al., 2019). Transformers are also successfully used as an autoregressive model on sequential tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al. 2019, Rae et al, 2020) and reinforcement learning (Parisotto et al., 2019). Unlike more traditional recurrent architectures such as RNNs and LSTMs, the Transformer architecture processes a sequence in parallel in an order-invariant way. Techniques such as position embeddings (Sukhbaatar et al. 2015, Shaw et al. 2018) and attention masking are required to capture input order information. In this work, we focus on several limitations of the Transformer architecture as an autoregressive model and present a straightforward solution - Feedback memory. These limitations and our proposed solution target sequential token prediction tasks, such as language modeling or other auto-regressive generative tasks. The feedforward nature of Transformers makes them efficient on modern hardware, but restricts the Transformer from taking full advantage of the input's sequential property. In particular, the current hidden representation of a Transformer only accesses the past representations of lower layers, even though higher level representations of the past have already been computed as an autoregressive model. At generation, the Transformer generates only one token at a time, so it could access these representations for better performance, but does not exploit these at training time due to parallelization. However, if these past higher level representations could be used at training time, they would enrich future lower level representations, enabling shallower models to have the same representation power. Another inherent limitation of Transformers on sequential tasks is the lack of recursive computation (Dehghani et al., 2018), and the number of transformations possible on the input is bounded by the model depth. Such disadvantages have impact on tasks that require careful tracking of a world state or modeling hierarchical structures (Tran et al., 2018; Hahn, 2020). On the other hand, while RNNs can maintain an internal state for an unbounded time while accumulating more computations upon it, the size of this internal state is limited by the dimension of the hidden state. In this work, we propose a novel autoregressive model, the Feedback Transformer, that makes all previous hidden representations accessible to the computation of a representation at any depth -\nthe model feeds back previous computations to itself. The feedback allows the model to perform recursive computation, building stronger representations iteratively upon previous states. To achieve this, we modify self-attention to attend to higher level representations rather than lower ones. As shown in Figure 1, the Feedback Transformer merges the hidden states from all layers into a single vector for every time step and stores them in a memory. Instead of self-attention, all subsequent layers attend to this memory, which means every previously computed representation is accessible by all future layers, mediated by the memory. This allows Feedback Transformers to recursively compute and transform an input as many times as the input length, which is something Transformers cannot achieve. While RNNs can perform recursive computation, the amount of information that Feedback Transformers can maintain is not limited by the number of layers. There are computational benefits to this straightforward modification. First, it uses less memory because all the layers share a single Feedback memory, thus reducing the memory size by $L$ times, where $L$ is the number of layers. There is also less computation because we share the key and value projections during attention computation, which increases the speed of the attention over the Feedback Memory. Further, the GPU memory usage is reduced due to the memory sharing - the overall model is 2 x smaller - allowing the batch size to be increased for computational efficiency. During inference, the increased batch size contributes to substantially faster decoding speeds. In summary, our main contributions are: (1) The Feedback Transformer architecture, which completely changes the way a Transformer works to access available higher level representations immediately. (2) We show the Feedback Transformer can achieve state of the art results with smaller, shallower models that have faster decoding speed and smaller memory footprint. (3) The Feedback Transformer uses substantially less memory during training and inference time. ## 2 RELATED WORK\n\nSeveral previous works have analyzed the limitations of Transformer architectures, such as the inability to process input sequentially (Dehghani et al. 2018) or represent hierarchical structure (Tran et al., 2018). Hahn (2020) demonstrate that Transformers cannot model structures involving bounded recursion, such as closing parentheses. P\u00e9rez et al. (2019) study Transformers in the context of Turing machines, where they must produce unbounded numbers of decoding steps. Various work in probing Transformers identified several limitations where Transformers may not have the computational capacity of recurrent architecture like an LSTM (Hahn, 2020). From the architectural perspective, our work shares similarities with recurrent networks augmented with external shared memories (Graves et al., 2014; Joulin \\& Mikolov, 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015). For example, the stack augmented RNN of Joulin \\& Mikolov(2015) adds an external memory to a recurrent network to keep long term dependencies. Closer to our work, the Neural Turing Machine of Graves et al. (2014) models an unconstrained memory that resembles the self-attention layer of a Transformer. Further improvements to recurrent networks, such as the Gated Feedback RNN (Chung et al., 2015), are based on better controlling signal from different layers and extended to feedback through multiple pathways (Jin et al., 2017). These works are built on recurrent networks with additional components to store long term dependencies. Other works have studied modifications to the Transformer architecture by enriching its structure with components inspired by recurrent networks. For example, Wang et al. (2019) propose adding a local recurrent sublayer to the Transformer layer to remove the need for position embeddings in the multi-head self-attention layers. Universal Transformer (Dehghani et al., 2018) share the parameters between the layers of a Transformer, leading a recurrent network in depth.\n```\n\n#### 5. Compositional Attention: Disentangling Search and Retrieval (Avg. Score: 0.53)\n\n*Sarthak Mittal, S. Raparthy, I. Rish, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2021)\t**Cited by** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure, and demonstrates that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.53)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 20 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: Selective Attention, Dynamic Parameter Generation, Memory Efficient Transformers\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

However, distant supervision inevitably accompanies with the wrong labelling problem, and these noisy data will substantially hurt the performance of relation extraction. To alleviate this issue, we propose a sentence-level attention-based model for relation extraction. In this model, we employ convolutional neural networks to embed the semantics of sentences. Afterwards, we build sentence-level attention over multiple instances, which is expected to dynamically reduce the weights of those noisy instances. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that, our model can make full use of all informative sentences and effectively reduce the in\ufb02uence of wrong labelled instances.

Recent works in context-aware NMT consider only a few previous sentences as context and may not scale to entire documents. To this end, we propose a novel and scalable top-down approach to hierarchical attention for context-aware NMT which uses sparse attention to selectively focus on relevant sentences in the document context and then attends to key words in those sentences. We also propose single-level attention approaches based on sentence or word-level information in the context. The document-level context representation, produced from these attention modules, is integrated into the encoder or decoder of the Transformer model depending on whether we use monolingual or bilingual context. Our experiments and evaluation on English-German datasets in different document MT settings show that our selective attention approach not only significantly outperforms context-agnostic baselines but also surpasses context-aware baselines in most cases.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 166  (*Influential: 31*)\n\n#### 3.

Prior generative approaches which decode slot values sequentially do not generalize well to variations in schema, while discriminative approaches separately encode history and schema and fail to account for inter-slot and intent-slot dependencies. We introduce SPLAT, a novel architecture which achieves better generalization and efficiency than prior approaches by constraining outputs to a limited prediction space. At the same time, our model allows for rich attention among descriptions and history while keeping computation costs constrained by incorporating linear-time attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and MultiWOZ datasets. Our approach significantly improves upon existing models achieving 85.3 JGA on the SGD dataset. Further, we show increased robustness on the SGD-X benchmark: our model outperforms the more than 30x larger D3ST-XXL model by 5.0 points.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel fine-tuning method DEER, which can make a single pre-trained model support Dynamic and Efficient infERence and achieve an adaptive trade-off between model performance and latency and explores the effectiveness of the pre- trained MLMs for text generation tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the excellent performance of Pre-trained Language Models on many text generation tasks, they suffer from inefficient inference on computation and memory due to their large-scale parameters and the universal autoregressive decoding paradigm. In this work, we propose a novel fine-tuning method DEER, which can make a single pre-trained model support Dynamic and Efficient infERence and achieve an adaptive trade-off between model performance and latency. In particular, our critical insight is to jointly utilize the non-autoregressive (NAR) generation and dynamic parameter pruning techniques, which can flexibly control the decoding iteration steps and model sizes according to memory and latency limitations. Besides, we also explore the effectiveness of the pre-trained MLMs (i.e., the BERT family) for text generation tasks since their bidirectional attention nature is more suitable for the NAR training objective. Extensive experiments on both monolingual and multilingual pre-trained MLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DEER method by consistently achieving (1) higher BLEU scores than the strong autoregressive Transformer model on three neural machine translation tasks with 3 \\to 12 times speedup, (2) competitive performance (but with much faster inference speed) compared with the BART model on four GLGE benchmark tasks.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6. Lightweight, Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks for AMR-to-Text Generation\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Parameter Generation*\n\n*Yan Zhang, Zhijiang Guo, Zhiyang Teng, Wei Lu, Shay B. Cohen, Zuozhu Liu, Lidong Bing*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs and develops two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** AMR-to-text generation is used to transduce Abstract Meaning Representation structures (AMR) into text. A key challenge in this task is to efficiently learn effective graph representations. Previously, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) were used to encode input AMRs, however, vanilla GCNs are not able to capture non-local information and additionally, they follow a local (first-order) information aggregation scheme. To account for these issues, larger and deeper GCN models are required to capture more complex interactions. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic fusion mechanism, proposing Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs. We further develop two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity. With the help of these strategies, we are able to train a model with fewer parameters while maintaining the model capacity. Experiments demonstrate that LDGCNs outperform state-of-the-art models on two benchmark datasets for AMR-to-text generation with significantly fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 7. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Efficient Transformers*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1345  (*Influential: 135*)\n\n#### 8. Memory Efficient Continual Learning with Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Efficient Transformers*\n\n*B. Ermi\u015f, Giovanni Zappella, Martin Wistuba, Aditya Rawal, C. Archambeau*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper devise a method to incrementally train a model on a sequence of tasks using pre-trained Transformers and extending them with Adapters that is able to scale to a large number of tasks without significant overhead and allows sharing information across tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** In many real-world scenarios, data to train machine learning models becomes available over time. Unfortunately, these models struggle to continually learn new concepts without forgetting what has been learnt in the past. This phenomenon is known as catastrophic forgetting and it is difficult to prevent due to practical constraints. For instance, the amount of data that can be stored or the computational resources that can be used might be limited. Moreover, applications increasingly rely on large pre-trained neural networks, such as pre-trained Transformers, since the resources or data might not be available in sufficiently large quantities to practitioners to train the model from scratch. In this paper, we devise a method to incrementally train a model on a sequence of tasks using pre-trained Transformers and extending them with Adapters. Different than the existing approaches, our method is able to scale to a large number of tasks without significant overhead and allows sharing information across tasks. On both image and text classification tasks, we empirically demonstrate that our method maintains a good predictive performance without retraining the model or increasing the number of model parameters over time. The resulting model is also significantly faster at inference time compared to Adapter-based state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient Attention Manipulation\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Efficient Transformers*\n\n*Mayukh Deb, Bjorn Deiseroth, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, P. Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 5 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Selective Attention Improves Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: Selective Attention*\n\n*Yaniv Leviathan, Matan Kalman, Yossi Matias*\n\n**Abstract:** Unneeded elements in the attention's context degrade performance. We\nintroduce Selective Attention, a simple parameter-free change to the standard\nattention mechanism which reduces attention to unneeded elements. Selective\nattention improves language modeling performance in a variety of model sizes\nand context lengths. For example, a range of transformers trained with the\nlanguage modeling objective on C4 with selective attention perform equivalently\nto standard transformers with ~2X more heads and parameters in their attention\nmodules. Selective attention also allows decreasing the size of the attention's\ncontext buffer, leading to meaningful reductions in the memory and compute\nrequirements during inference. For example, transformers with 100M parameters\ntrained on C4 with context sizes of 512, 1,024, and 2,048 need 16X, 25X, and\n47X less memory for their attention module, respectively, when equipped with\nselective attention, as those without selective attention, with the same\nvalidation perplexity.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-03T17:27:30Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-03T17:27:30Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Cross-relation Cross-bag Attention for Distantly-supervised Relation\n  Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: Selective Attention*\n\n*Yujin Yuan, Liyuan Liu, Siliang Tang, Zhongfei Zhang, Yueting Zhuang, Shiliang Pu, Fei Wu, Xiang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Distant supervision leverages knowledge bases to automatically label\ninstances, thus allowing us to train relation extractor without human\nannotations. However, the generated training data typically contain massive\nnoise, and may result in poor performances with the vanilla supervised\nlearning. In this paper, we propose to conduct multi-instance learning with a\nnovel Cross-relation Cross-bag Selective Attention (C$^2$SA), which leads to\nnoise-robust training for distant supervised relation extractor. Specifically,\nwe employ the sentence-level selective attention to reduce the effect of noisy\nor mismatched sentences, while the correlation among relations were captured to\nimprove the quality of attention weights. Moreover, instead of treating all\nentity-pairs equally, we try to pay more attention to entity-pairs with a\nhigher quality. Similarly, we adopt the selective attention mechanism to\nachieve this goal. Experiments with two types of relation extractor demonstrate\nthe superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art, while\nfurther ablation studies verify our intuitions and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed two techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2018-12-27T03:03:51Z  (*Updated: 2018-12-27T03:03:51Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Improving Distant Supervised Relation Extraction by Dynamic Neural\n  Network\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Parameter Generation*\n\n*Yanjie Gou, Yinjie Lei, Lingqiao Liu, Pingping Zhang, Xi Peng*\n\n**Abstract:** Distant Supervised Relation Extraction (DSRE) is usually formulated as a\nproblem of classifying a bag of sentences that contain two query entities, into\nthe predefined relation classes. Most existing methods consider those relation\nclasses as distinct semantic categories while ignoring their potential\nconnection to query entities. In this paper, we propose to leverage this\nconnection to improve the relation extraction accuracy. Our key ideas are\ntwofold: (1) For sentences belonging to the same relation class, the expression\nstyle, i.e. words choice, can vary according to the query entities. To account\nfor this style shift, the model should adjust its parameters in accordance with\nentity types. (2) Some relation classes are semantically similar, and the\nentity types appear in one relation may also appear in others. Therefore, it\ncan be trained cross different relation classes and further enhance those\nclasses with few samples, i.e., long-tail classes. To unify these two\narguments, we developed a novel Dynamic Neural Network for Relation Extraction\n(DNNRE). The network adopts a novel dynamic parameter generator that\ndynamically generates the network parameters according to the query entity\ntypes and relation classes. By using this mechanism, the network can\nsimultaneously handle the style shift problem and enhance the prediction\naccuracy for long-tail classes. Through our experimental study, we demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method and show that it can achieve superior\nperformance over the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-15T06:31:13Z  (*Updated: 2019-12-13T04:29:41Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Memory-efficient Transformers via Top-$k$ Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Efficient Transformers*\n\n*Ankit Gupta, Guy Dar, Shaya Goodman, David Ciprut, Jonathan Berant*\n\n**Abstract:** Following the success of dot-product attention in Transformers, numerous\napproximations have been recently proposed to address its quadratic complexity\nwith respect to the input length. While these variants are memory and compute\nefficient, it is not possible to directly use them with popular pre-trained\nlanguage models trained using vanilla attention, without an expensive\ncorrective pre-training stage. In this work, we propose a simple yet highly\naccurate approximation for vanilla attention. We process the queries in chunks,\nand for each query, compute the top-$k$ scores with respect to the keys. Our\napproach offers several advantages: (a) its memory usage is linear in the input\nsize, similar to linear attention variants, such as Performer and RFA (b) it is\na drop-in replacement for vanilla attention that does not require any\ncorrective pre-training, and (c) it can also lead to significant memory savings\nin the feed-forward layers after casting them into the familiar query-key-value\nframework. We evaluate the quality of top-$k$ approximation for multi-head\nattention layers on the Long Range Arena Benchmark, and for feed-forward layers\nof T5 and UnifiedQA on multiple QA datasets. We show our approach leads to\naccuracy that is nearly-identical to vanilla attention in multiple setups\nincluding training from scratch, fine-tuning, and zero-shot inference.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-13T02:30:23Z  (*Updated: 2021-06-13T02:30:23Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers for Near-Infinite Context\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Efficient Transformers*\n\n*Hao Liu, Matei Zaharia, Pieter Abbeel*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as the architecture of choice for many\nstate-of-the-art AI models, showcasing exceptional performance across a wide\nrange of AI applications. However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers\nlimit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in\nutilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in\ncomplex environments. We present a novel approach, Ring Attention with\nBlockwise Transformers (Ring Attention), which leverages blockwise computation\nof self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple\ndevices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the\ncomputation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference\nof sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by\nprior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or\nincurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive\nexperiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size\nand improving performance.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-03T08:44:50Z  (*Updated: 2023-11-27T06:38:47Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Sequential Attention for Feature Selection\n\n*From Search Query: Selective Attention*\n\n*Vahab Mirrokni, Gang Fu, Matthew Fahrbach, Lin Chen, Mohammadhossein Bateni, Taisuke Yasuda*\n\n**Abstract:** Feature selection is the problem of selecting a subset of features for a machine learning model that maximizes model quality subject to a budget constraint. For neural networks, prior methods, including those based on $\\ell_1$ regularization, attention, and other techniques, typically select the entire feature subset in one evaluation round, ignoring the residual value of features during selection, i.e., the marginal contribution of a feature given that other features have already been selected. We propose a feature selection algorithm called Sequential Attention that achieves state-of-the-art empirical results for neural networks. This algorithm is based on an efficient one-pass implementation of greedy forward selection and uses attention weights at each step as a proxy for feature importance. We give theoretical insights into our algorithm for linear regression by showing that an adaptation to this setting is equivalent to the classical Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm, and thus inherits all of its provable guarantees. Our theoretical and empirical analyses offer new explanations towards the effectiveness of attention and its connections to overparameterization, which may be of independent interest.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-29\n\n\n\n#### 2. Sequential Attention-based Network for Noetic End-to-End Response Selection\n\n*From Search Query: Selective Attention*\n\n*Qian Chen, Wen Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** The noetic end-to-end response selection challenge as one track in Dialog System Technology Challenges 7 (DSTC7) aims to push the state of the art of utterance classification for real world goal-oriented dialog systems, for which participants need to select the correct next utterances from a set of candidates for the multi-turn context. This paper describes our systems that are ranked the top on both datasets under this challenge, one focused and small (Advising) and the other more diverse and large (Ubuntu). Previous state-of-the-art models use hierarchy-based (utterance-level and token-level) neural networks to explicitly model the interactions among different turns' utterances for context modeling. In this paper, we investigate a sequential matching model based only on chain sequence for multi-turn response selection. Our results demonstrate that the potentials of sequential matching approaches have not yet been fully exploited in the past for multi-turn response selection. In addition to ranking the top in the challenge, the proposed model outperforms all previous models, including state-of-the-art hierarchy-based models, and achieves new state-of-the-art performances on two large-scale public multi-turn response selection benchmark datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-09\n\n\n\n#### 3. Joint Parameter Discovery and Generative Modeling of Dynamic Systems\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Parameter Generation*\n\n*Tzikang Chen, Mulugeta A. Haile, Gregory Barber*\n\n**Abstract:** Given an unknown dynamic system such as a coupled harmonic oscillator with $n$ springs and point masses. We are often interested in gaining insights into its physical parameters, i.e. stiffnesses and masses, by observing trajectories of motion. How do we achieve this from video frames or time-series data and without the knowledge of the dynamics model? We present a neural framework for estimating physical parameters in a manner consistent with the underlying physics. The neural framework uses a deep latent variable model to disentangle the system physical parameters from canonical coordinate observations. It then returns a Hamiltonian parameterization that generalizes well with respect to the discovered physical parameters. We tested our framework with simple harmonic oscillators, $n=1$, and noisy observations and show that it discovers the underlying system parameters and generalizes well with respect to these discovered parameters. Our model also extrapolates the dynamics of the system beyond the training interval and outperforms a non-physically constrained baseline model.

ConvBERT: Improving BERT with Span-based Dynamic Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Parameter Generation*\n\n*Zi-Hang Jiang, Yunpeng Chen, Weihao Yu, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan, Daquan Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models like BERT and its variants have recently achieved impressive performance in various natural language understanding tasks. However, BERT heavily relies on the global self-attention block and thus suffers large memory footprint and computation cost. Although all its attention heads query on the whole input sequence for generating the attention map from a global perspective, we observe some heads only need to learn local dependencies, which means the existence of computation redundancy. We therefore propose a novel span-based dynamic convolution to replace these self-attention heads to directly model local dependencies. The novel convolution heads, together with the rest self-attention heads, form a new mixed attention block that is more efficient at both global and local context learning. We equip BERT with this mixed attention design and build a ConvBERT model. Experiments have shown that ConvBERT significantly outperforms BERT and its variants in various downstream tasks, with lower training cost and fewer model parameters. Remarkably, ConvBERTbase model achieves 86.4 GLUE score, 0.7 higher than ELECTRAbase, while using less than 1/4 training cost. Code and pre-trained models will be released.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-08-06\n\n\n\n#### 5. EfficientViT: Memory Efficient Vision Transformer with Cascaded Group Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Efficient Transformers*\n\n*Yixuan Yuan, Han Hu, Yuqing Yang, Ningxin Zheng, Houwen Peng, Xinyu Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers have shown great success due to their high model capabilities. However, their remarkable performance is accompanied by heavy computation costs, which makes them unsuitable for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a family of high-speed vision transformers named EfficientViT. We find that the speed of existing transformer models is commonly bounded by memory inefficient operations, especially the tensor reshaping and element-wise functions in MHSA. Therefore, we design a new building block with a sandwich layout, i.e., using a single memory-bound MHSA between efficient FFN layers, which improves memory efficiency while enhancing channel communication. Moreover, we discover that the attention maps share high similarities across heads, leading to computational redundancy. To address this, we present a cascaded group attention module feeding attention heads with different splits of the full feature, which not only saves computation cost but also improves attention diversity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate EfficientViT outperforms existing efficient models, striking a good trade-off between speed and accuracy. For instance, our EfficientViT-M5 surpasses MobileNetV3-Large by 1.9% in accuracy, while getting 40.4% and 45.2% higher throughput on Nvidia V100 GPU and Intel Xeon CPU, respectively. Compared to the recent efficient model MobileViT-XXS, EfficientViT-M2 achieves 1.8% superior accuracy, while running 5.8x/3.7x faster on the GPU/CPU, and 7.4x faster when converted to ONNX format.

H3T: Efficient Integration of Memory Optimization and Parallelism for Large-scale Transformer Training\n\n*From Search Query: Memory Efficient Transformers*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, big models based on Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many artificial intelligence (AI) tasks.\nDespite the success of these Transformer-based models, their huge parameter size poses a serious challenge to their training, both from the storage and computation perspectives.\nTo this end, memory optimization (e.g., rematerialization and offloading) and parallelism (e.g., data parallelism and model parallelism) are widely explored to make training Transformers more efficient.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework to automatically find an efficient integration of memory optimization and parallelism for High-Throughput Transformer Training (named H3T), which is rarely considered by existing efforts for training big Transformer-based models.\nSpecifically, we design search algorithms to combine appropriate memory optimization strategies and parallelism schemes to achieve a balance between memory overhead and training efficiency.\nWe implement H3T based on an open-source toolkit BMTrain and then use H3T to train the Transformers of different sizes to evaluate the efficiency of H3T.\nThe experimental results show that H3T outperforms the most popular deep learning (DL) toolkit Megatron-DeepSpeed by $1.2\\times \\sim 4.3\\times$ training speed while reducing $34.6\\% \\sim 80.5\\%$ of memory overhead.\nMoreover, H3T can use only 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs to train GPT-3-175B, which is very difficult for existing DL toolkits. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMTrain/tree/h3t.Submission Number: 3012\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2023-11\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, focusing on hierarchical selective attention, dynamic parameter generation, and memory-efficient transformers is crucial. Here are some key insights and references that can help achieve this goal:\n\n## Hierarchical Selective Attention\n\n### Selective Attention Layers (SALs)\nThe Taipan model introduces Selective Attention Layers (SALs) that dynamically determine which tokens should undergo softmax attention processing. This approach enhances the model's ability to focus on critical tokens, reducing computational costs and maintaining overall efficiency. SALs use a lightweight gating network to select tokens, allowing the model to handle long sequences efficiently while capturing important long-range dependencies.\n\n### MindSkip and Attention with Dynamic Depths\nThe MindSkip approach applies dynamic depth selectively to attention layers, skipping less important layers to preserve model performance while enhancing computational and memory efficiency. This method is particularly effective when applied to attention layers, as skipping these layers results in only minor performance degradation compared to skipping MLP layers or entire transformer blocks.\n\n## Dynamic Parameter Generation\n\n### Dynamic Parameter Sharing and Adaptive Mechanisms\nModels like HGRN2 (Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion) and Eagle and Finch (RWKV with Matrix-Valued States and Dynamic Recurrence) highlight the potential for dynamic parameter adjustment. These mechanisms allow for adaptive parameter sharing, which can enhance expressivity without adding additional parameters. For instance, HGRN2 discusses state expansion mechanisms that improve expressivity, and Eagle and Finch uses matrix-valued states and dynamic recurrence to maintain efficiency while improving expressivity.\n\n### Router-Tuning\nThe Router-Tuning method fine-tunes only the router on a small dataset, which determines which layers to skip. This approach reduces the computational overhead associated with full model training and is particularly useful for dynamic parameter generation, as it allows for efficient adjustment of model parameters based on input importance.\n\n## Memory Management in Transformers\n\n### Reducing KV Cache and Activation Memory\nThe MindSkip approach significantly reduces the size of the KV cache, which is crucial for memory efficiency. For example, it achieves an 8GB reduction in KV cache size when processing long input sequences. Additionally, Block Selective Reprogramming (BSR) reduces activation memory by selectively training a small fraction of blocks and using token dropping, which can reduce activation memory up to 6\u00d7.\n\n### Infini-attention and Compressive Memory\nThe Infini-attention mechanism incorporates compressive memory into attention mechanisms, allowing for efficient handling of long-range dependencies without significant memory overhead. This approach is particularly relevant for memory-efficient transformer designs, as it enables the model to process long sequences efficiently while maintaining performance.\n\n## Hybrid Models and Future Directions\n\n### Combining Different Architectures\nHybrid models that integrate different architectures can offer enhanced performance and efficiency. For example, combining the selective attention mechanisms of Taipan with the dynamic parameter generation of HGRN2 or Eagle and Finch could create a highly efficient and expressive model. Additionally, incorporating memory management strategies like those in TRAMS and Infini-attention can further optimize the model's memory usage.\n\n### External and Internal Search\nFurther exploration of recent advancements in attention mechanisms, such as Linformer, Reformer, and Gated Linear Attention Transformers, can provide valuable insights into how these mechanisms can be adapted or combined with the proposed SelectiveGatedMHA. Delving deeper into existing literature on hierarchical attention and adaptive parameter sharing will also be crucial for ensuring the proposal's novelty and effectiveness.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that is highly efficient, scalable, and performs well across various tasks, aligning with the goals of low perplexity, high accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.\n",

Design Plan\n\n### 4.1 Architecture Overview\n\nThe SelectiveGatedMHA consists of three main components:\n\n1. **Selective Gate Module**:\n```python\nclass SelectiveGate(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, dim, num_heads):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.gate_proj = nn.Linear(dim, num_heads)\n        self.threshold = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1))\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Compute importance scores\n        scores = torch.sigmoid(self.gate_proj(x))\n        # Generate binary gates\n        gates = (scores > self.threshold).float()\n        return gates, scores\n```\n\n2. **Dynamic Parameter Generator**:\n```python\nclass DynamicParamGen(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, dim, num_heads, head_dim):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.proj = nn.Linear(dim, num_heads * head_dim)\n        self.head_dim = head_dim\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Generate dynamic parameters\n        params = self.proj(x)\n        return params.view(-1, num_heads, head_dim)\n```\n\n3. **Hierarchical Memory Manager**:\n```python\nclass HierMemManager(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, dim, block_size):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.block_size = block_size\n        self.cache = {}\n        \n    def forward(self, x, block_idx):\n        # Process input in blocks\n        blocks = x.chunk(self.block_size, dim=1)\n        return self.process_blocks(blocks, block_idx)\n```\n\n### 4.2 Mathematical Formulation\n\n1. **Selective Attention**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}) \\cdot G \\cdot V\n   \\]\n   where G is the binary gate matrix.\n\n2. **Dynamic Parameters**:\n   \\[\n   W_h = f_\\theta(x_h) \\cdot W_\\text{base}\n   \\]\n   where $f_\\theta$ is the parameter generation network.\n\n3. **Memory Access**:\n   \\[\n   M_b = \\text{BlockProcess}(X_{[b:b+s]}, P_b)\n   \\]\n   where b is the block index and s is block size.\n\n### 4.3 Implementation Guidelines\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n```python\nclass SelectiveGatedMHA(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, dim, num_heads, head_dim, block_size):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.selective_gate = SelectiveGate(dim, num_heads)\n        self.param_gen = DynamicParamGen(dim, num_heads, head_dim)\n        self.mem_manager = HierMemManager(dim, block_size)\n        \n        self.to_qkv = nn.Linear(dim, 3 * dim)\n        self.to_out = nn.Linear(dim, dim)\n```\n\n2. **Forward Pass**:\n```python\ndef forward(self, x):\n    B, L, D = x.shape\n    \n    # Generate gates and parameters\n    gates, scores = self.selective_gate(x)\n    params = self.param_gen(x)\n    \n    # Process in blocks\n    qkv = self.to_qkv(x).chunk(3, dim=-1)\n    q, k, v = map(lambda t: t.view(B, L, self.num_heads, -1), qkv)\n    \n    # Apply selective attention\n    attn = torch.einsum('bhid,bhjd->bhij', q, k) * gates.unsqueeze(-1)\n    attn = attn.softmax(dim=-1)\n    \n    # Apply dynamic parameters\n    out = torch.einsum('bhij,bhjd->bhid', attn, v * params)\n    out = out.reshape(B, L, -1)\n    \n    return self.to_out(out)\n```\n\n## 5. Theoretical Analysis\n\n1. **Computational Complexity**:\n   - Best case: O(N) when most gates are closed\n   - Average case: O(N log N) with hierarchical processing\n   - Worst case: O(N\u00b2) when all gates are open\n\n2. **Memory Usage**:\n   - Reduced by factor of (1 - g) where g is gate sparsity\n   - Block-based processing reduces peak memory\n   - Hierarchical caching improves efficiency\n\n3. **Expected Benefits**:\n   - Improved efficiency through selective computation\n   - Better handling of long sequences\n   - Reduced memory requirements\n   - Adaptive computation based on input\n\n## 6.
