    "review": "### Comprehensive Analysis of the DynSparseRotary Proposal\n\n**Clarity**\n\nThe **DynSparseRotary** proposal is well-articulated, with clear objectives to enhance the **FastTTTLinear** GAU by integrating **dynamic sparse attention mechanisms** with **adaptive rotary embeddings**. The motivation, related work, problem analysis, and detailed design plan are thoroughly presented, outlining the intended improvements in computational efficiency, scalability, and the ability to handle long sequences more effectively. The proposal successfully conveys the rationale behind each modification and how they contribute to the overall enhancement of the GAU.\n\n**Innovation**\n\nThe integration of **dynamic sparse attention mechanisms** with **adaptive rotary embeddings** within a **linear attention framework** is relatively novel. While both dynamic sparsity and adaptive positional encodings have been individually explored in transformer optimizations, their combined application specifically tailored for autoregressive language models presents a unique advancement. The proposal leverages insights from works like **RoFormer** and **Dynamic Sparse Flash Attention**, but the specific combination aims to bridge existing gaps in efficiently handling long-term dependencies without compromising model expressiveness. This synergistic integration has not been extensively explored in current literature, positioning **DynSparseRotary** as a potentially impactful innovation in the field.\n\n**Feasibility**\n\nThe design appears feasible, drawing upon proven methods for implementing dynamic sparsity and adaptive positional encodings. The proposal references successful implementations such as **SeqBoat** and **Routing Transformers**, indicating that similar integrations are achievable. However, the combination of these mechanisms within the **FastTTTLinear** GAU may introduce architectural complexity. Ensuring seamless interaction between dynamic sparsity and adaptive rotary embeddings will require meticulous design and potentially novel implementation strategies to maintain training stability and model performance.\n\n**Scalability**\n\n**DynSparseRotary** inherently enhances scalability by leveraging dynamic sparse attention to reduce computational and memory overheads, allowing the model to handle longer sequences more efficiently. The addition of adaptive rotary embeddings ensures robust positional encoding, even as sparsity patterns change, supporting the model's ability to maintain performance at scale. This aligns with current research trends focused on making transformers more efficient and scalable, as evidenced by studies like **A Length-Extrapolatable Transformer** and **Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models**.\n\n**Accuracy and Robustness**\n\nAdaptive rotary embeddings contribute to maintaining robust positional encoding, crucial for understanding and generating coherent long-range dependencies. Dynamic sparse attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on pertinent token interactions, potentially improving accuracy by reducing noise from irrelevant tokens. However, the balance between sparsity and expressiveness must be carefully managed to prevent degradation in model quality, particularly under diverse input conditions. Ensuring that the adaptive mechanisms do not inadvertently exclude important token interactions is essential for maintaining robustness.\n\n**Efficiency**\n\nThe proposed modifications are expected to offer substantial improvements in computational efficiency and memory usage. **Dynamic sparse attention mechanisms** significantly lower the computation required by focusing only on the most relevant token interactions, while **adaptive rotary embeddings** ensure that these sparse patterns do not compromise positional encoding. This combination maintains the model's ability to handle long sequences without incurring additional computational costs, addressing one of the primary limitations of traditional attention mechanisms.\n\n**Concerns**\n\n1. **Integration Complexity:** Combining dynamic sparse attention with adaptive rotary embeddings within the linear attention framework may introduce significant architectural complexity. Ensuring that these components work harmoniously without hindering model performance will require careful engineering and potentially novel implementation strategies.\n\n2. **Training Stability:** Adaptive mechanisms can complicate gradient flow and convergence. Strategies such as gradient checkpointing, proper normalization (e.g., using RMSNorm), and dynamic gating functions are essential to maintain training stability and ensure effective learning.\n\n3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Dynamic sparsity introduces additional hyperparameters (e.g., sparsity thresholds, gating mechanisms) that need meticulous tuning to achieve optimal performance. Balancing sparsity to maximize efficiency while preserving model expressiveness requires careful experimentation.\n\n4. **Hardware Optimization:** Achieving practical speedups and memory savings depends on effective hardware optimizations. Leveraging GPU-optimized kernels for sparse operations and ensuring that adaptive embeddings do not become a bottleneck are critical for realizing the theoretical efficiency gains in real-world applications.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement**\n\n1. **Architectural Clarity:** Provide detailed diagrams and pseudo-code illustrating the integration of dynamic sparse attention with adaptive rotary embeddings within the **FastTTTLinear** GAU. This will aid in understanding the flow and interactions between components, facilitating smoother implementation.\n\n2. **Training Strategies:** Elaborate on specific training strategies to ensure stability, such as normalization techniques, learning rate schedules, and gradient clipping tailored to the integrated mechanisms. Including guidelines for initializing gating mechanisms can help prevent issues during the initial stages of training.\n\n3. **Empirical Validation Plan:** Although empirical results are not expected at this stage, outlining a comprehensive benchmarking plan to evaluate the integrated mechanisms on standard datasets (e.g., Wikitext-103, Long Range Arena) would strengthen the proposal. This plan should include metrics for assessing computational efficiency, scalability, accuracy, and robustness.\n\n4. **Hardware Considerations:** Discuss potential hardware optimizations or deployment strategies to fully leverage the efficiency gains from dynamic sparse attention and adaptive rotary embeddings. Exploring the use of specialized libraries or custom kernels for sparse operations can enhance practical applicability.\n\n5. **Documentation and Code Samples:** Including snippets of implementation code or referencing similar projects can provide practical insights into how the proposed mechanisms can be integrated. This can serve as a guide for developers and researchers aiming to implement **DynSparseRotary**.\n\n### Final Rating\n\n```rating 4.2```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe **DynSparseRotary** proposal presents a promising and innovative enhancement to the **FastTTTLinear** GAU by integrating dynamic sparse attention mechanisms with adaptive rotary embeddings.

To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/35 (Score: 0.69)*\n\n```\nAlbert Gu, Karan Goel, and Christopher R\u00e9. 2021.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3. You Only Scan Once: Efficient Multi-dimension Sequential Modeling with LightNet (Avg.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.78)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.73)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.73)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 13 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: Dynamic Sparsity in Gated Linear Attention, Adaptive Attention Mechanisms in Language Models, State-Space Models in Autoregressive Models\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Sparsity in Gated Linear Attention*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: it replaces the softmax activation with a ReLU, and shows that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2. Mixture of Attention Heads: Selecting Attention Heads Per Token\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Sparsity in Gated Linear Attention*\n\n*Xiaofeng Zhang, Yikang Shen, Zeyu Huang, Jie Zhou, Wenge Rong, Zhang Xiong*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention Heads (MoA), a new architecture that combines multi-head attention with the MoE mechanism, is proposed, which can easily scale up the number of attention heads and theNumber of parameters while preserving computational efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) networks have been proposed as an efficient way to scale up model capacity and implement conditional computing. However, the study of MoE components mostly focused on the feedforward layer in Transformer architecture. This paper proposes the Mixture of Attention Heads (MoA), a new architecture that combines multi-head attention with the MoE mechanism. MoA includes a set of attention heads that each has its own set of parameters. Given an input, a router dynamically selects a subset of k attention heads per token. This conditional computation schema allows MoA to achieve stronger performance than the standard multi-head attention layer. Furthermore, the sparsely gated MoA can easily scale up the number of attention heads and the number of parameters while preserving computational efficiency. Despite performance improvements, MoA also automatically differentiates heads\u2019 utilities, providing a new perspective to discuss the model\u2019s interpretability. We conducted experiments on several important tasks, including Machine Translation and Masked Language Modeling. Experiments have shown promising results on several tasks against strong baselines that involve large and very deep models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 27  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 3. MosaicBERT: A Bidirectional Encoder Optimized for Fast Pretraining\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Sparsity in Gated Linear Attention*\n\n*Jacob Portes, Alex Trott, Sam Havens, Daniel King, Abhinav Venigalla, Moin Nadeem, Nikhil Sardana, D. Khudia, Jonathan Frankle*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that MosaicBERT base and large are consistently Pareto optimal when compared to a competitive BERT base and large, enabling researchers and engineers to pretrain custom BERT-style models at low cost instead of finetune on existing generic models.\n\n**Abstract:** Although BERT-style encoder models are heavily used in NLP research, many researchers do not pretrain their own BERTs from scratch due to the high cost of training. In the past half-decade since BERT first rose to prominence, many advances have been made with other transformer architectures and training configurations that have yet to be systematically incorporated into BERT. Here, we introduce MosaicBERT, a BERT-style encoder architecture and training recipe that is empirically optimized for fast pretraining. This efficient architecture incorporates FlashAttention, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi), Gated Linear Units (GLU), a module to dynamically remove padded tokens, and low precision LayerNorm into the classic transformer encoder block. The training recipe includes a 30% masking ratio for the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objective, bfloat16 precision, and vocabulary size optimized for GPU throughput, in addition to best-practices from RoBERTa and other encoder models. When pretrained from scratch on the C4 dataset, this base model achieves a downstream average GLUE (dev) score of 79.6 in 1.13 hours on 8 A100 80 GB GPUs at a cost of roughly $20. We plot extensive accuracy vs. pretraining speed Pareto curves and show that MosaicBERT base and large are consistently Pareto optimal when compared to a competitive BERT base and large. This empirical speed up in pretraining enables researchers and engineers to pretrain custom BERT-style models at low cost instead of finetune on existing generic models.

Improving Natural Language Understanding with Computation-Efficient Retrieval Representation Fusion\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Attention Mechanisms in Language Models*\n\n*Shangyu Wu, Ying Xiong, Yufei Cui, Xue Liu, Buzhou Tang, Tei-Wei Kuo, Chun Jason Xue*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new paradigm of RA named ReFusion is proposed, a computation-efficient Retrieval representation Fusion with bi-level optimization, which directly fuses the retrieval representations into the hidden states of models.\n\n**Abstract:** Retrieval-based augmentations (RA) incorporating knowledge from an external database into language models have greatly succeeded in various knowledge-intensive (KI) tasks. However, integrating retrievals in non-knowledge-intensive (NKI) tasks is still challenging. Existing works focus on concatenating retrievals with inputs to improve model performance. Unfortunately, the use of retrieval concatenation-based augmentations causes an increase in the input length, substantially raising the computational demands of attention mechanisms. This paper proposes a new paradigm of RA named \\textbf{ReFusion}, a computation-efficient Retrieval representation Fusion with bi-level optimization. Unlike previous works, ReFusion directly fuses the retrieval representations into the hidden states of models. Specifically, ReFusion leverages an adaptive retrieval integrator to seek the optimal combination of the proposed ranking schemes across different model layers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ReFusion can achieve superior and robust performance in various NKI tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Characterizing Mechanisms for Factual Recall in Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Attention Mechanisms in Language Models*\n\n*Qinan Yu, Jack Merullo, Ellie Pavlick*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work contributes to a body of evidence showing that the language model can often localize model behaviors to specific components and provides a proof of concept for how future methods might control model behavior dynamically at runtime.\n\n**Abstract:** Language Models (LMs) often must integrate facts they memorized in pretraining with new information that appears in a given context. These two sources can disagree, causing competition within the model, and it is unclear how an LM will resolve the conflict. On a dataset that queries for knowledge of world capitals, we investigate both distributional and mechanistic determinants of LM behavior in such situations. Specifically, we measure the proportion of the time an LM will use a counterfactual prefix (e.g.,\"The capital of Poland is London\") to overwrite what it learned in pretraining (\"Warsaw\"). On Pythia and GPT2, the training frequency of both the query country (\"Poland\") and the in-context city (\"London\") highly affect the models' likelihood of using the counterfactual. We then use head attribution to identify individual attention heads that either promote the memorized answer or the in-context answer in the logits. By scaling up or down the value vector of these heads, we can control the likelihood of using the in-context answer on new data. This method can increase the rate of generating the in-context answer to 88\\% of the time simply by scaling a single head at runtime. Our work contributes to a body of evidence showing that we can often localize model behaviors to specific components and provides a proof of concept for how future methods might control model behavior dynamically at runtime.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. REPLUG: Retrieval-Augmented Black-Box Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Attention Mechanisms in Language Models*\n\n*Weijia Shi, Sewon Min, Michihiro Yasunaga, Minjoon Seo, Rich James, M. Lewis, Luke Zettlemoyer, Wen-tau Yih*\n\n**TL;DR:** REPLUG is introduced, a retrieval-augmented language modeling framework that treats the language model (LM) as a black box and augments it with a tuneable retrieval model, and can be easily applied to any existing language models.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce REPLUG, a retrieval-augmented language modeling framework that treats the language model (LM) as a black box and augments it with a tuneable retrieval model. Unlike prior retrieval-augmented LMs that train language models with special cross-attention mechanisms to encode the retrieved text, REPLUG simply prepends retrieved documents to the input for the frozen black-box LM. This simple design can be easily applied to any existing language models. Furthermore, we show that the LM can be used to supervise the retrieval model, which can then find documents that help the LM make better predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that REPLUG with the tuned retriever significantly improves the performance of GPT-3 (175B) on language modeling by 6.3%, as well as the performance of Codex on five-shot MMLU by 5.1%.

Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: State-Space Models in Autoregressive Models*\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. It's Raw! Audio Generation with State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: State-Space Models in Autoregressive Models*\n\n*Karan Goel, Albert Gu, Chris Donahue, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** SaShiMi, a new multi-scale architecture for waveform modeling built around the recently introduced S4 model for long sequence modeling, is proposed, identifying that S4 can be unstable during autoregressive generation, and providing a simple improvement to its parameterization by drawing connections to Hurwitz matrices.\n\n**Abstract:** Developing architectures suitable for modeling raw audio is a challenging problem due to the high sampling rates of audio waveforms. Standard sequence modeling approaches like RNNs and CNNs have previously been tailored to fit the demands of audio, but the resultant architectures make undesirable computational tradeoffs and struggle to model waveforms effectively. We propose SaShiMi, a new multi-scale architecture for waveform modeling built around the recently introduced S4 model for long sequence modeling. We identify that S4 can be unstable during autoregressive generation, and provide a simple improvement to its parameterization by drawing connections to Hurwitz matrices. SaShiMi yields state-of-the-art performance for unconditional waveform generation in the autoregressive setting. Additionally, SaShiMi improves non-autoregressive generation performance when used as the backbone architecture for a diffusion model. Compared to prior architectures in the autoregressive generation setting, SaShiMi generates piano and speech waveforms which humans find more musical and coherent respectively, e.g. 2x better mean opinion scores than WaveNet on an unconditional speech generation task. On a music generation task, SaShiMi outperforms WaveNet on density estimation and speed at both training and inference even when using 3x fewer parameters.

Structured Denoising Diffusion Models in Discrete State-Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: State-Space Models in Autoregressive Models*\n\n*Jacob Austin, Daniel D. Johnson, Jonathan Ho, Daniel Tarlow, Rianne van den Berg*\n\n**TL;DR:** D3PMs are diffusion-like generative models for discrete data that generalize the multinomial diffusion model of Hoogeboom et al. 2021, by going beyond corruption processes with uniform transition probabilities and showing that the choice of transition matrix is an important design decision that leads to improved results in image and text domains.\n\n**Abstract:** Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) (Ho et al. 2020) have shown impressive results on image and waveform generation in continuous state spaces. Here, we introduce Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs), diffusion-like generative models for discrete data that generalize the multinomial diffusion model of Hoogeboom et al. 2021, by going beyond corruption processes with uniform transition probabilities. This includes corruption with transition matrices that mimic Gaussian kernels in continuous space, matrices based on nearest neighbors in embedding space, and matrices that introduce absorbing states. The third allows us to draw a connection between diffusion models and autoregressive and mask-based generative models. We show that the choice of transition matrix is an important design decision that leads to improved results in image and text domains. We also introduce a new loss function that combines the variational lower bound with an auxiliary cross entropy loss. For text, this model class achieves strong results on character-level text generation while scaling to large vocabularies on LM1B. On the image dataset CIFAR-10, our models approach the sample quality and exceed the log-likelihood of the continuous-space DDPM model.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 635  (*Influential: 97*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. LLaMA-Adapter: Efficient Fine-tuning of Language Models with Zero-init Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Attention Mechanisms in Language Models*\n\n*Peng Gao, Chris Liu, Yu Qiao, Hongsheng Li, Pan Lu, Shilin Yan, Xiangfei Hu, Aojun Zhou, Jiaming Han, Renrui Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** We present LLaMA-Adapter, a lightweight adaption method to efficiently fine-tune LLaMA into an instruction-following model. Using 52K self-instruct demonstrations, LLaMA-Adapter only introduces 1.2M learnable parameters upon the frozen LLaMA 7B model, and costs less than one hour for fine-tuning on 8 A100 GPUs. Specifically, we adopt a set of learnable adaption prompts, and prepend them to the word tokens at higher transformer layers. Then, a zero-initialized attention mechanism with zero gating is proposed, which adaptively injects the new instructional cues into LLaMA, while effectively preserves its pre-trained knowledge. With our efficient training, LLaMA-Adapter can generate high-quality responses, comparable to Alpaca with fully fine-tuned 7B parameters. Besides language commands, our approach can be simply extended to multi-modal instructions for learning image-conditioned LLaMA model, which achieves superior reasoning performance on ScienceQA and COCO Caption benchmarks. Furthermore, we also evaluate the zero-initialized attention mechanism for fine-tuning other pre-trained models (ViT, RoBERTa) on traditional vision and language tasks, demonstrating the superior generalization capacity of our approach.

Our framework is notable for (1) its open-source support for multi-round and multi-image dialogues, (2) introducing an innovative multi-modal causal attention mechanism, and (3) utilizing data blending techniques on existing datasets to assure seamless interactions in multi-round, multi-image conversations.

MambaOut: Do We Really Need Mamba for Vision?\n\n*From Search Query: State-Space Models in Autoregressive Models*\n\n*Xinchao Wang, Weihao Yu*\n\n**Abstract:** Mamba, an architecture with RNN-like token mixer of state space model (SSM), was recently introduced to address the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism and subsequently applied to vision tasks. Nevertheless, the performance of Mamba for vision is often underwhelming when compared with convolutional and attention-based models. In this paper, we delve into the essence of Mamba, and conceptually conclude that Mamba is ideally suited for tasks with long-sequence and autoregressive characteristics. For vision tasks, as image classification does not align with either characteristic, we hypothesize that Mamba is not necessary for this task; Detection and segmentation tasks are also not autoregressive, yet they adhere to the long-sequence characteristic, so we believe it is still worthwhile to explore Mamba's potential for these tasks. To empirically verify our hypotheses, we construct a series of models named MambaOut through stacking Mamba blocks while removing their core token mixer, SSM. Experimental results strongly support our hypotheses. Specifically, our MambaOut model surpasses all visual Mamba models on ImageNet image classification, indicating that Mamba is indeed unnecessary for this task. As for detection and segmentation, MambaOut cannot match the performance of state-of-the-art visual Mamba models, demonstrating the potential of Mamba for long-sequence visual tasks.

Generating Diverse High-Fidelity Images with VQ-VAE-2\n\n*From Search Query: State-Space Models in Autoregressive Models*\n\n*Ali Razavi, Oriol Vinyals, Aaron van den Oord*\n\n**Abstract:** We explore the use of Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) models for large scale image generation. To this end, we scale and enhance the autoregressive priors used in VQ-VAE to generate synthetic samples of much higher coherence and fidelity than possible before. We use simple feed-forward encoder and decoder networks, making our model an attractive candidate for applications where the encoding and/or decoding speed is critical. Additionally, VQ-VAE requires sampling an autoregressive model only in the compressed latent space, which is an order of magnitude faster than sampling in the pixel space, especially for large images. We demonstrate that a multi-scale hierarchical organization of VQ-VAE, augmented with powerful priors over the latent codes, is able to generate samples with quality that rivals that of state of the art Generative Adversarial Networks on multifaceted datasets such as ImageNet, while not suffering from GAN's known shortcomings such as mode collapse and lack of diversity.\n\n**Conference:** generating-diverse-high-fidelity-images-with\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-02\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher enhance the FastTTTLinear Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) by integrating dynamic sparsity, adaptive attention mechanisms, and state-space models, here are some key insights and references that align with the researcher's goals:\n\n## Dynamic Sparsity in Attention Mechanisms\n\nThe concept of dynamic sparsity in attention mechanisms is crucial for reducing computational overhead and improving efficiency, especially for long sequences. The paper on **SeerAttention** provides a compelling approach:\n\n- **SeerAttention** introduces a learnable gate that adaptively selects significant blocks in the attention map, allowing for block-level sparsity. This mechanism learns the sparsity from the model itself, rather than relying on predefined patterns or heuristics. It demonstrates near-lossless accuracy even at high sparsity levels and offers significant speedup over dense attention baselines.\n\n## Adaptive Attention Mechanisms\n\nAdaptive attention mechanisms can enhance the model's performance by dynamically adjusting the focus based on the input complexity. Here, the adaptability of **SeerAttention** is particularly relevant:\n\n- **SeerAttention**'s adaptive gate allows the model to adjust its attention sparsity based on the context, which is essential for handling diverse and complex datasets. This adaptability ensures that the model can maintain high accuracy while reducing computational demands.\n\n## State-Space Models (SSMs) for Long-Sequence Modeling\n\nIncorporating SSMs can improve the model's ability to capture long-term dependencies efficiently. While the provided sources do not directly discuss SSMs in the context of language models, the general concept of SSMs can be applied:\n\n- **State-Space Models** are known for their ability to manage and update hidden states efficiently. Integrating SSM concepts into the FastTTTLinear architecture could enhance its scalability and efficiency in handling long sequences. This would involve designing a structured approach to maintaining and updating the hidden states, potentially leveraging hierarchical processing and normalization techniques.\n\n## Hierarchical Processing and Normalization\n\nHierarchical processing and normalization can further enhance the model's ability to handle diverse input patterns and maintain stability during training and inference.\n\n- **Hierarchical normalization** and multi-scale processing, as seen in some sibling proposals, can improve the model's stability and performance. These techniques ensure that the model can handle varied input patterns efficiently and maintain its expressiveness.\n\n## Efficiency and Scalability\n\nEnsuring that the modifications maintain or improve computational efficiency is critical. Here, the **SeerAttention** mechanism offers promising insights:\n\n- **SeerAttention** achieves significant speedup over dense attention baselines, especially at high sparsity levels. This makes it an attractive solution for improving the efficiency of the FastTTTLinear model without sacrificing accuracy.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo achieve the researcher's goals, the following steps and references are particularly useful:\n\n- **Integrate Dynamic Sparsity:** Implement the **SeerAttention** mechanism to leverage dynamic sparsity in the attention maps. This will help in reducing computational overhead and maintaining accuracy.\n- **Adaptive Attention:** Utilize the adaptive gate in **SeerAttention** to dynamically adjust the attention sparsity based on the input context, enhancing the model's performance on diverse datasets.\n- **State-Space Models:** Explore the application of SSM concepts to improve the model's efficiency in handling long sequences. This could involve designing a structured approach to managing and updating hidden states.\n- **Hierarchical Processing and Normalization:** Incorporate hierarchical normalization and multi-scale processing techniques to enhance the model's stability and performance on varied input patterns.\n\nBy integrating these elements, the researcher can significantly enhance the FastTTTLinear GAU, achieving better efficiency, scalability, and performance on long sequences.\n",

This requires careful design to ensure that modifications like dynamic sparsity do not interfere with the model's adaptability during inference.\n\n- **Efficiency and Scalability:**\n  \n  The proposed modifications should aim for linear or near-linear computational complexity relative to sequence length.

Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Franz A. Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials.

(2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.87)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Score: 0.78)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/30 (Score: 0.78)*\n\n```\nAs context windows become larger by the day in state-of-the-art models, we expect these gains to become even more relevant. Interpretability. Fig. 8 provides insights into the interpretability aspect of the model's decisionmaking process. It is observed that token removal predominantly occurs when encountering stop words (punctuation), which aligns with the intuition that local information within a sentence becomes less relevant after its completion. Furthermore, it is worth noting that layers at varying depths exhibit distinct behaviors, reinforcing our rationale for dissecting token removal decisions across depth. The variance in sparsity distribution across different depths indicates the necessity of conducting additional interpretability research to obtain valuable insights in the interactions of the tokens within the model. We provide more insights towards this direction in the Appendix C. ## 5 Discussion\n\nWe proposed Adaptively Sparse Attention, a novel approach to dynamically prune the context in decoder-only Transformer architectures. Our results indicate that our technique performs favourably compared to competitive baselines in terms of the ratio between perplexity and sparsity of the attention weights. Remarkably our approach also significantly reduces the computational and memory requirements without affecting its final performance. We practically showcase these benefits achieving more than double the throughput at cases. Adaptively sparse attention comes with two additional practical advantages: first, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained models via a cheap fine-tuning step; second, it represents an orthogonal contribution to the burgeoning research line aimed at increasing the level of efficiency of modern LLMs. As such, we envision its combination with existing techniques like weight pruning and quantization to be a promising avenue for future research. ## References\n\nLalit R Bahl, Frederick Jelinek, and Robert L Mercer.

Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/49 (Score: 0.50)*\n\n```\nGovernment.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 16 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: Learnable Sparse Attention, Hierarchical State-Space Models, Dynamic Attention Mechanisms\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 7 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Sparse DETR: Efficient End-to-End Object Detection with Learnable Sparsity\n\n*From Search Query: Learnable Sparse Attention*\n\n*Byungseok Roh, Jaewoong Shin, Wuhyun Shin, Saehoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** Sparse DETR is proposed that selectively updates only the tokens expected to be referenced by the decoder to help the model effectively detect objects and achieves better performance than Deformable DETR even with only 10% encoder tokens on the COCO dataset.\n\n**Abstract:** DETR is the first end-to-end object detector using a transformer encoder-decoder architecture and demonstrates competitive performance but low computational efficiency on high resolution feature maps. The subsequent work, Deformable DETR, enhances the efficiency of DETR by replacing dense attention with deformable attention, which achieves 10x faster convergence and improved performance. Deformable DETR uses the multiscale feature to ameliorate performance, however, the number of encoder tokens increases by 20x compared to DETR, and the computation cost of the encoder attention remains a bottleneck. In our preliminary experiment, we observe that the detection performance hardly deteriorates even if only a part of the encoder token is updated. Inspired by this observation, we propose Sparse DETR that selectively updates only the tokens expected to be referenced by the decoder, thus help the model effectively detect objects. In addition, we show that applying an auxiliary detection loss on the selected tokens in the encoder improves the performance while minimizing computational overhead. We validate that Sparse DETR achieves better performance than Deformable DETR even with only 10% encoder tokens on the COCO dataset. Albeit only the encoder tokens are sparsified, the total computation cost decreases by 38% and the frames per second (FPS) increases by 42% compared to Deformable DETR.

QueryPose: Sparse Multi-Person Pose Regression via Spatial-Aware Part-Level Query\n\n*From Search Query: Learnable Sparse Attention*\n\n*Yabo Xiao, Kai Su, Xiaojuan Wang, Dongdong Yu, Lei Jin, Mingshu He, Zehuan Yuan*\n\n**TL;DR:** A sparse end-to-end multi-person pose regression framework, termed QueryPose, which can directly predict multi- person keypoint sequences from the input image and surpasses the existing dense end- to-end methods with 73.6 AP on MS COCO mini-val set and 72.7 AP on CrowdPose test set.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a sparse end-to-end multi-person pose regression framework, termed QueryPose, which can directly predict multi-person keypoint sequences from the input image. The existing end-to-end methods rely on dense representations to preserve the spatial detail and structure for precise keypoint localization. However, the dense paradigm introduces complex and redundant post-processes during inference. In our framework, each human instance is encoded by several learnable spatial-aware part-level queries associated with an instance-level query. First, we propose the Spatial Part Embedding Generation Module (SPEGM) that considers the local spatial attention mechanism to generate several spatial-sensitive part embeddings, which contain spatial details and structural information for enhancing the part-level queries. Second, we introduce the Selective Iteration Module (SIM) to adaptively update the sparse part-level queries via the generated spatial-sensitive part embeddings stage-by-stage. Based on the two proposed modules, the part-level queries are able to fully encode the spatial details and structural information for precise keypoint regression. With the bipartite matching, QueryPose avoids the hand-designed post-processes and surpasses the existing dense end-to-end methods with 73.6 AP on MS COCO mini-val set and 72.7 AP on CrowdPose test set.

Structured Pruning for Efficient Generative Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Learnable Sparse Attention*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Haoli Bai, Jiansheng Wei, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study proposes S IMPLE, a new structured pruning framework for generative PLMs that comprehensively investigates all the above compress-ible components and assigns learnable masks over compressible components followed by sparse training to identify redundant network structures.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing sizes of large generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) hinder their deployment in real-world applications. To obtain ef\ufb01cient PLMs, previous studies mostly focus on pruning the attention heads and feed-forward networks (FFNs) of the Transformer. Nevertheless, we \ufb01nd that in generative PLMs, the hidden dimension shared by many other modules (e.g., embedding layer and layer normalization) contains persistent outliers regardless of the network input. In this study, we propose S IMPLE , a new structured pruning framework for generative PLMs that comprehensively investigates all the above compress-ible components. To identify redundant network structures, we assign learnable masks over compressible components followed by sparse training. Various sizes of PLMs can be \ufb02exibly extracted via different thresholds, and are then task-speci\ufb01cally \ufb01ne-tuned for further improvement. Extensive experiments on language modeling, summarization and machine translation validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For example, the pruned BART brings 1.51x/6.96x inference speedup on GPU/CPU with 67% size reduction, and can be further combined with quantization for more than 25 \u00d7 compression.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

Socher*\n\n**TL;DR:** The new DMN+ model improves the state of the art on both the Visual Question Answering dataset and the \\babi-10k text question-answering dataset without supporting fact supervision.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural network architectures with memory and attention mechanisms exhibit certain reasoning capabilities required for question answering. One such architecture, the dynamic memory network (DMN), obtained high accuracy on a variety of language tasks. However, it was not shown whether the architecture achieves strong results for question answering when supporting facts are not marked during training or whether it could be applied to other modalities such as images. Based on an analysis of the DMN, we propose several improvements to its memory and input modules. Together with these changes we introduce a novel input module for images in order to be able to answer visual questions.

We propose for video QA a novel model which performs dynamic multistep reasoning between questions and videos. It creates video semantic representation based on the video scene graph composed of semantic elements of the video and semantic relations among these elements. Then, it performs multistep reasoning for better answer decision between the representations of the question and the video, and dynamically integrate the reasoning results. Experiments show the significant advantage of the proposed model against previous methods in accuracy and interpretability.

Smart Bird: Learnable Sparse Attention for Efficient and Effective\n  Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: Learnable Sparse Attention*\n\n*Chuhan Wu, Fangzhao Wu, Tao Qi, Binxing Jiao, Daxin Jiang, Yongfeng Huang, Xing Xie*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer has achieved great success in NLP. However, the quadratic\ncomplexity of the self-attention mechanism in Transformer makes it inefficient\nin handling long sequences. Many existing works explore to accelerate\nTransformers by computing sparse self-attention instead of a dense one, which\nusually attends to tokens at certain positions or randomly selected tokens.\nHowever, manually selected or random tokens may be uninformative for context\nmodeling. In this paper, we propose Smart Bird, which is an efficient and\neffective Transformer with learnable sparse attention. In Smart Bird, we first\ncompute a sketched attention matrix with a single-head low-dimensional\nTransformer, which aims to find potential important interactions between\ntokens. We then sample token pairs based on their probability scores derived\nfrom the sketched attention matrix to generate different sparse attention index\nmatrices for different attention heads.

Generating Distractors for Reading Comprehension Questions from Real\n  Examinations\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Yifan Gao, Lidong Bing, Piji Li, Irwin King, Michael R. Lyu*\n\n**Abstract:** We investigate the task of distractor generation for multiple choice reading\ncomprehension questions from examinations. In contrast to all previous works,\nwe do not aim at preparing words or short phrases distractors, instead, we\nendeavor to generate longer and semantic-rich distractors which are closer to\ndistractors in real reading comprehension from examinations. Taking a reading\ncomprehension article, a pair of question and its correct option as input, our\ngoal is to generate several distractors which are somehow related to the\nanswer, consistent with the semantic context of the question and have some\ntrace in the article. We propose a hierarchical encoder-decoder framework with\nstatic and dynamic attention mechanisms to tackle this task. Specifically, the\ndynamic attention can combine sentence-level and word-level attention varying\nat each recurrent time step to generate a more readable sequence. The static\nattention is to modulate the dynamic attention not to focus on question\nirrelevant sentences or sentences which contribute to the correct option. Our\nproposed framework outperforms several strong baselines on the first prepared\ndistractor generation dataset of real reading comprehension questions. For\nhuman evaluation, compared with those distractors generated by baselines, our\ngenerated distractors are more functional to confuse the annotators.\n\n**Published:** 2018-09-08T07:11:15Z  (*Updated: 2018-12-18T07:04:50Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Adaptive Sparse ViT: Towards Learnable Adaptive Token Pruning by Fully Exploiting Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Learnable Sparse Attention*\n\n*Guodong Guo, Tianyi Wu, Xiangcheng Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformer has emerged as a new paradigm in computer vision, showing excellent performance while accompanied by expensive computational cost. Image token pruning is one of the main approaches for ViT compression, due to the facts that the complexity is quadratic with respect to the token number, and many tokens containing only background regions do not truly contribute to the final prediction. Existing works either rely on additional modules to score the importance of individual tokens, or implement a fixed ratio pruning strategy for different input instances. In this work, we propose an adaptive sparse token pruning framework with a minimal cost. Specifically, we firstly propose an inexpensive attention head importance weighted class attention scoring mechanism. Then, learnable parameters are inserted as thresholds to distinguish informative tokens from unimportant ones. By comparing token attention scores and thresholds, we can discard useless tokens hierarchically and thus accelerate inference. The learnable thresholds are optimized in budget-aware training to balance accuracy and complexity, performing the corresponding pruning configurations for different input instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method improves the throughput of DeiT-S by 50% and brings only 0.2% drop in top-1 accuracy, which achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and latency than the previous methods.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-28\n\n\n\n#### 2. Deep differentiable forest with sparse attention for the tabular data\n\n*From Search Query: Learnable Sparse Attention*\n\n*Yingshi Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a general architecture of deep differentiable forest and its sparse attention mechanism. The differentiable forest has the advantages of both trees and neural networks. Its structure is a simple binary tree, easy to use and understand. It has full differentiability and all variables are learnable parameters. We would train it by the gradient-based optimization method, which shows great power in the training of deep CNN. We find and analyze the attention mechanism in the differentiable forest. That is, each decision depends on only a few important features, and others are irrelevant. The attention is always sparse. Based on this observation, we improve its sparsity by data-aware initialization. We use the attribute importance to initialize the attention weight. Then the learned weight is much sparse than that from random initialization. Our experiment on some large tabular dataset shows differentiable forest has higher accuracy than GBDT, which is the state of art algorithm for tabular datasets.

Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical State-Space Models*\n\n*Lerrel Pinto, Tess Hellebrekers, Abhinav Gupta, Carmel Majidi, Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Chenyu Wang, Raunaq Bhirangi*\n\n**Abstract:** Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical State-Space Models*\n\n*Ralf Herbrich, Rainer Schlosser, Paul Mattes*\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-08\n\n\n\n#### 5. Hybrid intelligence for dynamic job-shop scheduling with deep reinforcement learning and attention mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Bo Yuan, Xiu Li, Rong Wang, Yuanzhi Dai, Zijun Liao, Yunhui Zeng*\n\n**Abstract:** The dynamic job-shop scheduling problem (DJSP) is a class of scheduling tasks that specifically consider the inherent uncertainties such as changing order requirements and possible machine breakdown in realistic smart manufacturing settings. Since traditional methods cannot dynamically generate effective scheduling strategies in face of the disturbance of environments, we formulate the DJSP as a Markov decision process (MDP) to be tackled by reinforcement learning (RL). For this purpose, we propose a flexible hybrid framework that takes disjunctive graphs as states and a set of general dispatching rules as the action space with minimum prior domain knowledge. The attention mechanism is used as the graph representation learning (GRL) module for the feature extraction of states, and the double dueling deep Q-network with prioritized replay and noisy networks (D3QPN) is employed to map each state to the most appropriate dispatching rule. Furthermore, we present Gymjsp, a public benchmark based on the well-known OR-Library, to provide a standardized off-the-shelf facility for RL and DJSP research communities. Comprehensive experiments on various DJSP instances confirm that our proposed framework is superior to baseline algorithms with smaller makespan across all instances and provide empirical justification for the validity of the various components in the hybrid framework.\n\n**Published:** 2022-01-03\n\n\n\n#### 6. DRAGNN: A Transition-based Framework for Dynamically Connected Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Ivan Bogatyy, Lingpeng Kong, David Weiss, Chris Alberti, Daniel Andor*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we present a compact, modular framework for constructing novel\nrecurrent neural architectures. Our basic module is a new generic unit, the\nTransition Based Recurrent Unit (TBRU). In addition to hidden layer\nactivations, TBRUs have discrete state dynamics that allow network connections\nto be built dynamically as a function of intermediate activations. By\nconnecting multiple TBRUs, we can extend and combine commonly used\narchitectures such as sequence-to-sequence, attention mechanisms, and\nre-cursive tree-structured models. A TBRU can also serve as both an encoder for\ndownstream tasks and as a decoder for its own task simultaneously, resulting in\nmore accurate multi-task learning. We call our approach Dynamic Recurrent\nAcyclic Graphical Neural Networks, or DRAGNN. We show that DRAGNN is\nsignificantly more accurate and efficient than seq2seq with attention for\nsyntactic dependency parsing and yields more accurate multi-task learning for\nextractive summarization tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2017-03-13\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of integrating advanced techniques into the FastTTTLinear Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) to enhance its efficiency and scalability, here are some key insights and references that align with the provided keywords and description:\n\n### Learnable Sparse Attention\n\n- **ReLA (Sparse Attention with Linear Units)**: This method replaces the softmax activation with a ReLU, leading to natural sparsity and significant speedup over dense attention baselines.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis**\n\n- **Dynamic Sparsity Implementation:**\n  \n  Integrating dynamic sparsity into attention mechanisms, as demonstrated by ReLA and MoA, can significantly reduce computational overhead and enhance efficiency without compromising model performance. ReLA's replacement of softmax with ReLU leads to natural sparsity, while MoA's selective attention head activation offers flexibility in handling diverse inputs. Applying these concepts to FastTTTLinear GAU can optimize resource utilization, especially for long sequences.\n\n- **Adaptive Attention Mechanisms:**\n  \n  Adaptive attention, through mechanisms like MoA and dynamic gating in SeerAttention, allows the model to allocate computational resources dynamically based on input complexity. This adaptability can enhance FastTTTLinear's ability to manage varied and complex datasets, maintaining high accuracy while reducing unnecessary computations.\n\n- **Integration of State-Space Models (SSMs):**\n  \n  The integration of SSMs, as seen in SPADE and DenseMamba, provides a structured approach to managing hidden states efficiently. Augmenting FastTTTLinear with hierarchical SSM layers can improve the model's capacity to capture long-term dependencies and maintain scalability. Dense connections within SSMs further enhance information flow, leading to better performance on long-sequence tasks.\n\n- **Hierarchical Normalization and Processing:**\n  \n  Hierarchical normalization techniques, such as those employed in MosaicBERT and hierarchicalpositionawarelm, contribute to training stability and efficient handling of diverse input patterns. Incorporating RMSNorm and LayerNorm strategically within GAUs can enhance FastTTTLinear's robustness and expressiveness.\n\n- **Retrieval-Augmented Techniques:**\n  \n  Approaches like REPLUG and ReFusion demonstrate the benefits of integrating retrieval mechanisms to augment hidden states with external information. While primarily focused on retrieval, these methods offer insights into enhancing FastTTTLinear's adaptability and knowledge integration capabilities, especially for knowledge-intensive tasks.\n\n- **Fine-Tuning and Adaptation:**\n  \n  Fine-tuning strategies from LLaMA-Adapter emphasize efficient parameter updates through learnable prompts and zero-initialized attention. Adopting similar techniques can make FastTTTLinear more adaptable during fine-tuning phases, allowing it to specialize efficiently for specific tasks without extensive retraining.\n\n- **Model Optimization and Efficiency:**\n  \n  Optimizations like FlashAttention and multi-modal causal attention in DeepSpeed-VisualChat provide valuable insights into enhancing the computational efficiency of attention mechanisms. Implementing similar optimizations within FastTTTLinear can ensure scalability and speed, particularly when dealing with large models and long sequences.\n\n- **Evaluation of Redundancy:**\n  \n  Findings from MambaOut highlight the importance of assessing the necessity of each component within a model. For FastTTTLinear, this underscores the need to evaluate the contribution of integrated mechanisms like SSMs and adaptive attention to ensure they provide tangible benefits without introducing unnecessary complexity or computational burdens.\n\n**4.

To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 2. Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192. We open-source the code for Routing Transformer in Tensorflow.1\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/50 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n# Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers \n\nAurko Roy and Mohammad Saffar and Ashish Vaswani and David Grangier<br>Google Research<br>\\{aurkor, msaffar, avaswani, grangier\\}@google.com\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nSelf-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems.\n```\n\n#### 3. Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Szymon Tworkowski, Micha\u0142 Tyrolski, Lukasz Kaiser, Yuhuai Wu, Christian Szegedy, H. Michalewski*\n\n**Published in:** NAACL-HLT (2021)\t**Cited by** 40  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Hourglass is created - a hierarchical Transformer language model that improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark and sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models yield impressive results on many NLP and sequence modeling tasks. Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Score: 0.98)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

JoMA: Demystifying Multilayer Transformers via JOint Dynamics of MLP and Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Sparse Attention*\n\n*Yuandong Tian, Yiping Wang, Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Beidi Chen, Simon S. Du*\n\n**TL;DR:** JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse, then dense, then dense in the presence of nonlinear activations in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Joint MLP/Attention (JoMA) dynamics, a novel mathematical framework to understand the training procedure of multilayer Transformer architectures. This is achieved by integrating out the self-attention layer in Transformers, producing a modified dynamics of MLP layers only. JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis (e.g., lack of residual connection) and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse (to learn salient tokens), then dense (to learn less salient tokens) in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time. We leverage JoMA to qualitatively explains how tokens are combined to form hierarchies in multilayer Transformers, when the input tokens are generated by a latent hierarchical generative model. Experiments on models trained from real-world dataset (Wikitext2/Wikitext103) and various pre-trained models (OPT, Pythia) verify our theoretical findings.

Green Hierarchical Vision Transformer for Masked Image Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Sparse Attention*\n\n*Lang Huang, Shan You, Mingkai Zheng, Fei Wang, Chen Qian, T. Yamasaki*\n\n**Abstract:** We present an efficient approach for Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with hierarchical Vision Transformers (ViTs), allowing the hierarchical ViTs to discard masked patches and operate only on the visible ones. Our approach consists of three key designs. First, for window attention, we propose a Group Window Attention scheme following the Divide-and-Conquer strategy. To mitigate the quadratic complexity of the self-attention w.r.t. the number of patches, group attention encourages a uniform partition that visible patches within each local window of arbitrary size can be grouped with equal size, where masked self-attention is then performed within each group. Second, we further improve the grouping strategy via the Dynamic Programming algorithm to minimize the overall computation cost of the attention on the grouped patches. Third, as for the convolution layers, we convert them to the Sparse Convolution that works seamlessly with the sparse data, i.e., the visible patches in MIM. As a result, MIM can now work on most, if not all, hierarchical ViTs in a green and efficient way. For example, we can train the hierarchical ViTs, e.g., Swin Transformer and Twins Transformer, about 2.7$\\times$ faster and reduce the GPU memory usage by 70%, while still enjoying competitive performance on ImageNet classification and the superiority on downstream COCO object detection benchmarks.

HEDNet: A Hierarchical Encoder-Decoder Network for 3D Object Detection in Point Clouds\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Sparse Attention*\n\n*Gang Zhang, Junnan Chen, Guohuan Gao, Jianmin Li, Xiaolin Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** HEDNet is proposed, a hierarchical encoder-decoder network for 3D object detection, which leverages encoder and decoder blocks to capture long-range dependencies among features in the spatial space, particularly for large and distant objects.\n\n**Abstract:** 3D object detection in point clouds is important for autonomous driving systems. A primary challenge in 3D object detection stems from the sparse distribution of points within the 3D scene. Existing high-performance methods typically employ 3D sparse convolutional neural networks with small kernels to extract features. To reduce computational costs, these methods resort to submanifold sparse convolutions, which prevent the information exchange among spatially disconnected features. Some recent approaches have attempted to address this problem by introducing large-kernel convolutions or self-attention mechanisms, but they either achieve limited accuracy improvements or incur excessive computational costs. We propose HEDNet, a hierarchical encoder-decoder network for 3D object detection, which leverages encoder-decoder blocks to capture long-range dependencies among features in the spatial space, particularly for large and distant objects. We conducted extensive experiments on the Waymo Open and nuScenes datasets. HEDNet achieved superior detection accuracy on both datasets than previous state-of-the-art methods with competitive efficiency.

SHARCS can train a router on any transformer network, enabling the model to direct different samples to sub-networks with varying widths. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) SHARCS outperforms or complements existing per-sample adaptive inference methods across various classification tasks in terms of accuracy vs. FLOPs; (2) SHARCS generalizes across different architectures and can be even applied to compressed and efficient transformer encoders to further improve their efficiency; (3) SHARCS can provide a 2 times inference speed up at an insignificant drop in accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

Dynamic Routing Transformer Network for Multimodal Sarcasm Detection\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Routing in Transformers*\n\n*Yuan Tian, Nan Xu, Ruike Zhang, W. Mao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work model the dynamic mechanism in multimodal sarcasm detection and proposes the Dynamic Routing Transformer Network (DynRT-Net), which utilizes dynamic paths to activate different routing transformer modules with hierarchical co-attention adapting to cross-modal incongruity.\n\n**Abstract:** Multimodal sarcasm detection is an important research topic in natural language processing and multimedia computing, and benefits a wide range of applications in multiple domains. Most existing studies regard the incongruity between image and text as the indicative clue in identifying multimodal sarcasm. To capture cross-modal incongruity, previous methods rely on fixed architectures in network design, which restricts the model from dynamically adjusting to diverse image-text pairs. Inspired by routing-based dynamic network, we model the dynamic mechanism in multimodal sarcasm detection and propose the Dynamic Routing Transformer Network (DynRT-Net). Our method utilizes dynamic paths to activate different routing transformer modules with hierarchical co-attention adapting to cross-modal incongruity. Experimental results on a public dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Mastering Memory Tasks with World Models\n\n*From Search Query: State-Space Models Integration*\n\n*Mohammad Reza Samsami, Artem Zholus, Janarthanan Rajendran, Sarath Chandar*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work integrates a new family of state space models (SSMs) in world models of MBRL agents to present a new method, Recall to Imagine (R2I), which aims to enhance both long-term memory and long-horizon credit assignment.\n\n**Abstract:** Current model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agents struggle with long-term dependencies. This limits their ability to effectively solve tasks involving extended time gaps between actions and outcomes, or tasks demanding the recalling of distant observations to inform current actions. To improve temporal coherence, we integrate a new family of state space models (SSMs) in world models of MBRL agents to present a new method, Recall to Imagine (R2I). This integration aims to enhance both long-term memory and long-horizon credit assignment. Through a diverse set of illustrative tasks, we systematically demonstrate that R2I not only establishes a new state-of-the-art for challenging memory and credit assignment RL tasks, such as BSuite and POPGym, but also showcases superhuman performance in the complex memory domain of Memory Maze. At the same time, it upholds comparable performance in classic RL tasks, such as Atari and DMC, suggesting the generality of our method. We also show that R2I is faster than the state-of-the-art MBRL method, DreamerV3, resulting in faster wall-time convergence.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. Distributional Gradient Matching for Learning Uncertain Neural Dynamics Models\n\n*From Search Query: State-Space Models Integration*\n\n*Lenart Treven, Philippe Wenk, Florian Dorfler, Andreas Krause*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed algorithm - distributional gradient matching (DGM) - jointly trains a smoother and a dynamics model and matches their gradients via minimizing a Wasserstein loss, and is significantly more accurate than traditional approximate inference methods based on numerical integration.\n\n**Abstract:** Differential equations in general and neural ODEs in particular are an essential technique in continuous-time system identification. While many deterministic learning algorithms have been designed based on numerical integration via the adjoint method, many downstream tasks such as active learning, exploration in reinforcement learning, robust control, or filtering require accurate estimates of predictive uncertainties. In this work, we propose a novel approach towards estimating epistemically uncertain neural ODEs, avoiding the numerical integration bottleneck. Instead of modeling uncertainty in the ODE parameters, we directly model uncertainties in the state space. Our algorithm - distributional gradient matching (DGM) - jointly trains a smoother and a dynamics model and matches their gradients via minimizing a Wasserstein loss. Our experiments show that, compared to traditional approximate inference methods based on numerical integration, our approach is faster to train, faster at predicting previously unseen trajectories, and in the context of neural ODEs, significantly more accurate.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. Sinkhorn Natural Gradient for Generative Models\n\n*From Search Query: State-Space Models Integration*\n\n*Zebang Shen, Zhenfu Wang, Alejandro Ribeiro, Hamed Hassani*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that the Sinkhorn information matrix (SIM), a key component of SiNG, has an explicit expression and can be evaluated accurately in complexity that scales logarithmically with respect to the desired accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** We consider the problem of minimizing a functional over a parametric family of probability measures, where the parameterization is characterized via a push-forward structure. An important application of this problem is in training generative adversarial networks. In this regard, we propose a novel Sinkhorn Natural Gradient (SiNG) algorithm which acts as a steepest descent method on the probability space endowed with the Sinkhorn divergence. We show that the Sinkhorn information matrix (SIM), a key component of SiNG, has an explicit expression and can be evaluated accurately in complexity that scales logarithmically with respect to the desired accuracy. This is in sharp contrast to existing natural gradient methods that can only be carried out approximately. Moreover, in practical applications when only Monte-Carlo type integration is available, we design an empirical estimator for SIM and provide the stability analysis. In our experiments, we quantitatively compare SiNG with state-of-the-art SGD-type solvers on generative tasks to demonstrate its efficiency and efficacy of our method.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 1 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. An Exploration of Hierarchical Attention Transformers for Efficient Long\n  Document Classification\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Sparse Attention*\n\n*Ilias Chalkidis, Xiang Dai, Manos Fergadiotis, Prodromos Malakasiotis, Desmond Elliott*\n\n**Abstract:** Non-hierarchical sparse attention Transformer-based models, such as\nLongformer and Big Bird, are popular approaches to working with long documents.\nThere are clear benefits to these approaches compared to the original\nTransformer in terms of efficiency, but Hierarchical Attention Transformer\n(HAT) models are a vastly understudied alternative. We develop and release\nfully pre-trained HAT models that use segment-wise followed by cross-segment\nencoders and compare them with Longformer models and partially pre-trained\nHATs. In several long document downstream classification tasks, our best HAT\nmodel outperforms equally-sized Longformer models while using 10-20% less GPU\nmemory and processing documents 40-45% faster.

Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Sparse Attention*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are quickly becoming one of the most heavily applied deep learning architectures across modalities, domains, and tasks. In vision, on top of ongoing efforts into plain transformers, hierarchical transformers have also gained significant attention, thanks to their performance and easy integration into existing frameworks. These models typically employ localized attention mechanisms, such as the sliding-window Neighborhood Attention (NA) or Swin Transformer's Shifted Window Self Attention. While effective at reducing self attention's quadratic complexity, local attention weakens two of the most desirable properties of self attention: long range inter-dependency modeling, and global receptive field. In this paper, we introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), a natural, flexible and efficient extension to NA that can capture more global context and expand receptive fields exponentially at no additional cost. NA's local attention and DiNA's sparse global attention complement each other, and therefore we introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer (DiNAT), a new hierarchical vision transformer built upon both. DiNAT variants enjoy significant improvements over strong baselines such as NAT, Swin, and ConvNeXt. Our large model is faster and ahead of its Swin counterpart by 1.6% box AP in COCO object detection, 1.4% mask AP in COCO instance segmentation, and 1.4% mIoU in ADE20K semantic segmentation. Paired with new frameworks, our large variant is the new state of the art panoptic segmentation model on COCO (58.5 PQ) and ADE20K (49.4 PQ), and instance segmentation model on Cityscapes (45.1 AP) and ADE20K (35.4 AP) (no extra data). It also matches the state of the art specialized semantic segmentation models on ADE20K (58.1 mIoU), and ranks second on Cityscapes (84.5 mIoU) (no extra data).\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-29\n\n\n\n#### 2. Data Augmentation with Hierarchical SQL-to-Question Generation for Cross-domain Text-to-SQL Parsing\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Sparse Attention*\n\n*Zhenghua Li, Lijie Wang, Kun Wu, Haifeng Wang, Min Zhang, Hua Wu, Xinyan Xiao, Ao Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Data augmentation has attracted a lot of research attention in the deep learning era for its ability in alleviating data sparseness. The lack of labeled data for unseen evaluation databases is exactly the major challenge for cross-domain text-to-SQL parsing. Previous works either require human intervention to guarantee the quality of generated data, or fail to handle complex SQL queries. This paper presents a simple yet effective data augmentation framework. First, given a database, we automatically produce a large number of SQL queries based on an abstract syntax tree grammar. For better distribution matching, we require that at least 80% of SQL patterns in the training data are covered by generated queries. Second, we propose a hierarchical SQL-to-question generation model to obtain high-quality natural language questions, which is the major contribution of this work. Finally, we design a simple sampling strategy that can greatly improve training efficiency given large amounts of generated data. Experiments on three cross-domain datasets, i.e., WikiSQL and Spider in English, and DuSQL in Chinese, show that our proposed data augmentation framework can consistently improve performance over strong baselines, and the hierarchical generation component is the key for the improvement.\n\n**Proceeding:** emnlp-2021-11\n\n**Published:** 2021-03-03\n\n\n\n#### 3. DiT: Efficient Vision Transformers with Dynamic Token Routing\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Routing in Transformers*\n\n*Junshi Huang, Zhengcong Fei, Yuchen Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, the tokens of images share the same static data flow in many dense networks. However, challenges arise from the variance among the objects in images, such as large variations in the spatial scale and difficulties of recognition for visual entities. In this paper, we propose a data-dependent token routing strategy to elaborate the routing paths of image tokens for Dynamic Vision Transformer, dubbed DiT. The proposed framework generates a data-dependent path per token, adapting to the object scales and visual discrimination of tokens. In feed-forward, the differentiable routing gates are designed to select the scaling paths and feature transformation paths for image tokens, leading to multi-path feature propagation. In this way, the impact of object scales and visual discrimination of image representation can be carefully tuned. Moreover, the computational cost can be further reduced by giving budget constraints to the routing gate and early-stopping of feature extraction. In experiments, our DiT achieves superior performance and favorable complexity/accuracy trade-offs than many SoTA methods on ImageNet classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Particularly, the DiT-B5 obtains 84.8\\% top-1 Acc on ImageNet with 10.3 GFLOPs, which is 1.0\\% higher than that of the SoTA method with similar computational complexity. These extensive results demonstrate that DiT can serve as versatile backbones for various vision tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-07\n\n\n\n#### 4. Tutel: Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts at Scale\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Routing in Transformers*\n\n*Yongqiang Xiong, Mao Yang, Fan Yang, Peng Cheng, Joe Chau, Prabhat Ram, Jithin Jose, Rafael Salas, Zilong Wang, Han Hu, Ze Liu, Ziyue Yang, Yifan Xiong, Wei Cui, Changho Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has been widely adopted to scale deep learning models to trillion-plus parameters with fixed computational cost. The algorithmic performance of MoE relies on its token routing mechanism that forwards each input token to the right sub-models or experts. While token routing dynamically determines the amount of expert workload at runtime, existing systems suffer inefficient computation due to their static execution, namely static parallelism and pipelining, which does not adapt to the dynamic workload. We present Flex, a highly scalable stack design and implementation for MoE with dynamically adaptive parallelism and pipelining. Flex designs an identical layout for distributing MoE model parameters and input data, which can be leveraged by all possible parallelism or pipelining methods without any mathematical inequivalence or tensor migration overhead. This enables adaptive parallelism/pipelining optimization at zero cost during runtime. Based on this key design, Flex also implements various MoE acceleration techniques. Aggregating all techniques, Flex finally delivers huge speedup at any scale -- 4.96x and 5.75x speedup of a single MoE layer over 16 and 2,048 A100 GPUs, respectively, over the previous state-of-the-art. Our evaluation shows that Flex efficiently and effectively runs a real-world MoE-based model named SwinV2-MoE, built upon Swin Transformer V2, a state-of-the-art computer vision architecture. On efficiency, Flex accelerates SwinV2-MoE, achieving up to 1.55x and 2.11x speedup in training and inference over Fairseq, respectively. On effectiveness, the SwinV2-MoE model achieves superior accuracy in both pre-training and down-stream computer vision tasks such as COCO object detection than the counterpart dense model, indicating the readiness of Flex for end-to-end real-world model training and inference.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-07\n\n\n\n#### 5. MixConv: Mixed Depthwise Convolutional Kernels\n\n*From Search Query: State-Space Models Integration*\n\n*Quoc V. Le, Mingxing Tan*\n\n**Abstract:** Depthwise convolution is becoming increasingly popular in modern efficient ConvNets, but its kernel size is often overlooked. In this paper, we systematically study the impact of different kernel sizes, and observe that combining the benefits of multiple kernel sizes can lead to better accuracy and efficiency. Based on this observation, we propose a new mixed depthwise convolution (MixConv), which naturally mixes up multiple kernel sizes in a single convolution. As a simple drop-in replacement of vanilla depthwise convolution, our MixConv improves the accuracy and efficiency for existing MobileNets on both ImageNet classification and COCO object detection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MixConv, we integrate it into AutoML search space and develop a new family of models, named as MixNets, which outperform previous mobile models including MobileNetV2 [20] (ImageNet top-1 accuracy +4.2%), ShuffleNetV2 [16] (+3.5%), MnasNet [26] (+1.3%), ProxylessNAS [2] (+2.2%), and FBNet [27] (+2.0%). In particular, our MixNet-L achieves a new state-of-the-art 78.9% ImageNet top-1 accuracy under typical mobile settings (<600M FLOPS).

SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector\n\n*From Search Query: State-Space Models Integration*\n\n*Cheng-Yang Fu, Christian Szegedy, Wei Liu, Scott Reed, Dumitru Erhan, Dragomir Anguelov, Alexander C. Berg*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep\nneural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of\nbounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and\nscales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates\nscores for the presence of each object category in each default box and\nproduces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally,\nthe network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different\nresolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. Our SSD model is\nsimple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely\neliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stage\nand encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to\ntrain and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection\ncomponent. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ILSVRC datasets\nconfirm that SSD has comparable accuracy to methods that utilize an additional\nobject proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework\nfor both training and inference. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD\nhas much better accuracy, even with a smaller input image size. For $300\\times\n300$ input, SSD achieves 72.1% mAP on VOC2007 test at 58 FPS on a Nvidia Titan\nX and for $500\\times 500$ input, SSD achieves 75.1% mAP, outperforming a\ncomparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model.

This can be achieved by adapting the block-level sparsity and dynamic token selection methods.\n  - Dynamic context pruning and adaptive compression techniques can further optimize the model's efficiency by selectively processing relevant tokens and pruning less important ones[Analysis Note, Section 3].\n\n- **Hierarchical State-Space Models**:\n  - Integrating hierarchical SSMs like HiSS can capture multi-scale temporal dependencies, enhancing the model's ability to handle long sequences. This integration can be done by stacking multiple SSM layers and selectively integrating hidden states from different layers[Analysis Note, References 10 and 12].\n\n- **Balancing Performance and Efficiency**:\n  - Techniques such as sparse modular activation and structured pruning can help balance performance with computational and memory efficiency.

Implementing a similar mechanism in FastTTTLinear GAU can lead to adaptive resource allocation based on token relevance.\n\n- **Hierarchical State-Space Models (SSMs):**\n  - **Multi-Scale Temporal Dependencies:** Hierarchical SSMs, as seen in HiSS, enable the model to capture dependencies at various temporal scales, which is crucial for understanding long sequences. Integrating hierarchical SSMs with FastTTTLinear GAU can improve the handling of long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency.\n  - **State Integration Strategies:** DenseMamba's approach of selectively integrating shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers ensures high fidelity in state propagation, suggesting that similar strategies can be employed in FastTTTLinear GAU for enhanced state management.\n\n- **Dynamic Attention Adaptations:**\n  - **Selective Attention Activation:** Models like QueryPose and Dynamic Memory Networks (DRAGNN) utilize dynamic attention adaptations to focus on contextually relevant information, improving both efficiency and interpretability. Incorporating such dynamic attention strategies into FastTTTLinear GAU can enhance its ability to selectively process important tokens.\n  - **Adaptive Compression:** Techniques from Structured Pruning and Dynamic Context Pruning highlight the benefits of adaptive compression in reducing memory and computational requirements. Applying adaptive compression within GAUs can lead to significant efficiency gains, especially in handling extensive contexts.\n\n- **Integration of SSMs with Attention Mechanisms:**\n  - **Complementary Strengths:** Combining SSMs with attention mechanisms, as seen in SPADE and HiSS, leverages the strengths of both architectures\u2014SSMs for efficient state management and Transformers for their expressive power.

To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 2. Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

JoMA: Demystifying Multilayer Transformers via JOint Dynamics of MLP and Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Sparse Attention*\n\n*Yuandong Tian, Yiping Wang, Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Beidi Chen, Simon S. Du*\n\n**TL;DR:** JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse, then dense, then dense in the presence of nonlinear activations in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Joint MLP/Attention (JoMA) dynamics, a novel mathematical framework to understand the training procedure of multilayer Transformer architectures. This is achieved by integrating out the self-attention layer in Transformers, producing a modified dynamics of MLP layers only. JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis (e.g., lack of residual connection) and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse (to learn salient tokens), then dense (to learn less salient tokens) in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time. We leverage JoMA to qualitatively explains how tokens are combined to form hierarchies in multilayer Transformers, when the input tokens are generated by a latent hierarchical generative model. Experiments on models trained from real-world dataset (Wikitext2/Wikitext103) and various pre-trained models (OPT, Pythia) verify our theoretical findings.

Green Hierarchical Vision Transformer for Masked Image Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Sparse Attention*\n\n*Lang Huang, Shan You, Mingkai Zheng, Fei Wang, Chen Qian, T. Yamasaki*\n\n**Abstract:** We present an efficient approach for Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with hierarchical Vision Transformers (ViTs), allowing the hierarchical ViTs to discard masked patches and operate only on the visible ones. Our approach consists of three key designs. First, for window attention, we propose a Group Window Attention scheme following the Divide-and-Conquer strategy. To mitigate the quadratic complexity of the self-attention w.r.t. the number of patches, group attention encourages a uniform partition that visible patches within each local window of arbitrary size can be grouped with equal size, where masked self-attention is then performed within each group. Second, we further improve the grouping strategy via the Dynamic Programming algorithm to minimize the overall computation cost of the attention on the grouped patches. Third, as for the convolution layers, we convert them to the Sparse Convolution that works seamlessly with the sparse data, i.e., the visible patches in MIM. As a result, MIM can now work on most, if not all, hierarchical ViTs in a green and efficient way. For example, we can train the hierarchical ViTs, e.g., Swin Transformer and Twins Transformer, about 2.7$\\times$ faster and reduce the GPU memory usage by 70%, while still enjoying competitive performance on ImageNet classification and the superiority on downstream COCO object detection benchmarks.

HEDNet: A Hierarchical Encoder-Decoder Network for 3D Object Detection in Point Clouds\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Sparse Attention*\n\n*Gang Zhang, Junnan Chen, Guohuan Gao, Jianmin Li, Xiaolin Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** HEDNet is proposed, a hierarchical encoder-decoder network for 3D object detection, which leverages encoder and decoder blocks to capture long-range dependencies among features in the spatial space, particularly for large and distant objects.\n\n**Abstract:** 3D object detection in point clouds is important for autonomous driving systems. A primary challenge in 3D object detection stems from the sparse distribution of points within the 3D scene. Existing high-performance methods typically employ 3D sparse convolutional neural networks with small kernels to extract features. To reduce computational costs, these methods resort to submanifold sparse convolutions, which prevent the information exchange among spatially disconnected features. Some recent approaches have attempted to address this problem by introducing large-kernel convolutions or self-attention mechanisms, but they either achieve limited accuracy improvements or incur excessive computational costs. We propose HEDNet, a hierarchical encoder-decoder network for 3D object detection, which leverages encoder-decoder blocks to capture long-range dependencies among features in the spatial space, particularly for large and distant objects. We conducted extensive experiments on the Waymo Open and nuScenes datasets. HEDNet achieved superior detection accuracy on both datasets than previous state-of-the-art methods with competitive efficiency.

Dynamic Routing Transformer Network for Multimodal Sarcasm Detection\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Routing in Transformers*\n\n*Yuan Tian, Nan Xu, Ruike Zhang, W. Mao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work model the dynamic mechanism in multimodal sarcasm detection and proposes the Dynamic Routing Transformer Network (DynRT-Net), which utilizes dynamic paths to activate different routing transformer modules with hierarchical co-attention adapting to cross-modal incongruity.\n\n**Abstract:** Multimodal sarcasm detection is an important research topic in natural language processing and multimedia computing, and benefits a wide range of applications in multiple domains. Most existing studies regard the incongruity between image and text as the indicative clue in identifying multimodal sarcasm. To capture cross-modal incongruity, previous methods rely on fixed architectures in network design, which restricts the model from dynamically adjusting to diverse image-text pairs. Inspired by routing-based dynamic network, we model the dynamic mechanism in multimodal sarcasm detection and propose the Dynamic Routing Transformer Network (DynRT-Net). Our method utilizes dynamic paths to activate different routing transformer modules with hierarchical co-attention adapting to cross-modal incongruity.

Mastering Memory Tasks with World Models\n\n*From Search Query: State-Space Models Integration*\n\n*Mohammad Reza Samsami, Artem Zholus, Janarthanan Rajendran, Sarath Chandar*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work integrates a new family of state space models (SSMs) in world models of MBRL agents to present a new method, Recall to Imagine (R2I), which aims to enhance both long-term memory and long-horizon credit assignment.\n\n**Abstract:** Current model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agents struggle with long-term dependencies. This limits their ability to effectively solve tasks involving extended time gaps between actions and outcomes, or tasks demanding the recalling of distant observations to inform current actions. To improve temporal coherence, we integrate a new family of state space models (SSMs) in world models of MBRL agents to present a new method, Recall to Imagine (R2I). This integration aims to enhance both long-term memory and long-horizon credit assignment. Through a diverse set of illustrative tasks, we systematically demonstrate that R2I not only establishes a new state-of-the-art for challenging memory and credit assignment RL tasks, such as BSuite and POPGym, but also showcases superhuman performance in the complex memory domain of Memory Maze. At the same time, it upholds comparable performance in classic RL tasks, such as Atari and DMC, suggesting the generality of our method. We also show that R2I is faster than the state-of-the-art MBRL method, DreamerV3, resulting in faster wall-time convergence.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. Distributional Gradient Matching for Learning Uncertain Neural Dynamics Models\n\n*From Search Query: State-Space Models Integration*\n\n*Lenart Treven, Philippe Wenk, Florian Dorfler, Andreas Krause*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed algorithm - distributional gradient matching (DGM) - jointly trains a smoother and a dynamics model and matches their gradients via minimizing a Wasserstein loss, and is significantly more accurate than traditional approximate inference methods based on numerical integration.\n\n**Abstract:** Differential equations in general and neural ODEs in particular are an essential technique in continuous-time system identification. While many deterministic learning algorithms have been designed based on numerical integration via the adjoint method, many downstream tasks such as active learning, exploration in reinforcement learning, robust control, or filtering require accurate estimates of predictive uncertainties. In this work, we propose a novel approach towards estimating epistemically uncertain neural ODEs, avoiding the numerical integration bottleneck. Instead of modeling uncertainty in the ODE parameters, we directly model uncertainties in the state space. Our algorithm - distributional gradient matching (DGM) - jointly trains a smoother and a dynamics model and matches their gradients via minimizing a Wasserstein loss. Our experiments show that, compared to traditional approximate inference methods based on numerical integration, our approach is faster to train, faster at predicting previously unseen trajectories, and in the context of neural ODEs, significantly more accurate.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. Sinkhorn Natural Gradient for Generative Models\n\n*From Search Query: State-Space Models Integration*\n\n*Zebang Shen, Zhenfu Wang, Alejandro Ribeiro, Hamed Hassani*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that the Sinkhorn information matrix (SIM), a key component of SiNG, has an explicit expression and can be evaluated accurately in complexity that scales logarithmically with respect to the desired accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** We consider the problem of minimizing a functional over a parametric family of probability measures, where the parameterization is characterized via a push-forward structure. An important application of this problem is in training generative adversarial networks. In this regard, we propose a novel Sinkhorn Natural Gradient (SiNG) algorithm which acts as a steepest descent method on the probability space endowed with the Sinkhorn divergence. We show that the Sinkhorn information matrix (SIM), a key component of SiNG, has an explicit expression and can be evaluated accurately in complexity that scales logarithmically with respect to the desired accuracy. This is in sharp contrast to existing natural gradient methods that can only be carried out approximately. Moreover, in practical applications when only Monte-Carlo type integration is available, we design an empirical estimator for SIM and provide the stability analysis. In our experiments, we quantitatively compare SiNG with state-of-the-art SGD-type solvers on generative tasks to demonstrate its efficiency and efficacy of our method.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 1 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Sparse Attention*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are quickly becoming one of the most heavily applied deep learning architectures across modalities, domains, and tasks. In vision, on top of ongoing efforts into plain transformers, hierarchical transformers have also gained significant attention, thanks to their performance and easy integration into existing frameworks. These models typically employ localized attention mechanisms, such as the sliding-window Neighborhood Attention (NA) or Swin Transformer's Shifted Window Self Attention. While effective at reducing self attention's quadratic complexity, local attention weakens two of the most desirable properties of self attention: long range inter-dependency modeling, and global receptive field. In this paper, we introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), a natural, flexible and efficient extension to NA that can capture more global context and expand receptive fields exponentially at no additional cost. NA's local attention and DiNA's sparse global attention complement each other, and therefore we introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer (DiNAT), a new hierarchical vision transformer built upon both. DiNAT variants enjoy significant improvements over strong baselines such as NAT, Swin, and ConvNeXt. Our large model is faster and ahead of its Swin counterpart by 1.6% box AP in COCO object detection, 1.4% mask AP in COCO instance segmentation, and 1.4% mIoU in ADE20K semantic segmentation. Paired with new frameworks, our large variant is the new state of the art panoptic segmentation model on COCO (58.5 PQ) and ADE20K (49.4 PQ), and instance segmentation model on Cityscapes (45.1 AP) and ADE20K (35.4 AP) (no extra data). It also matches the state of the art specialized semantic segmentation models on ADE20K (58.1 mIoU), and ranks second on Cityscapes (84.5 mIoU) (no extra data).\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-29\n\n\n\n#### 2. Data Augmentation with Hierarchical SQL-to-Question Generation for Cross-domain Text-to-SQL Parsing\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Sparse Attention*\n\n*Zhenghua Li, Lijie Wang, Kun Wu, Haifeng Wang, Min Zhang, Hua Wu, Xinyan Xiao, Ao Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Data augmentation has attracted a lot of research attention in the deep learning era for its ability in alleviating data sparseness. The lack of labeled data for unseen evaluation databases is exactly the major challenge for cross-domain text-to-SQL parsing. Previous works either require human intervention to guarantee the quality of generated data, or fail to handle complex SQL queries. This paper presents a simple yet effective data augmentation framework. First, given a database, we automatically produce a large number of SQL queries based on an abstract syntax tree grammar. For better distribution matching, we require that at least 80% of SQL patterns in the training data are covered by generated queries. Second, we propose a hierarchical SQL-to-question generation model to obtain high-quality natural language questions, which is the major contribution of this work. Finally, we design a simple sampling strategy that can greatly improve training efficiency given large amounts of generated data. Experiments on three cross-domain datasets, i.e., WikiSQL and Spider in English, and DuSQL in Chinese, show that our proposed data augmentation framework can consistently improve performance over strong baselines, and the hierarchical generation component is the key for the improvement.\n\n**Proceeding:** emnlp-2021-11\n\n**Published:** 2021-03-03\n\n\n\n#### 3. DiT: Efficient Vision Transformers with Dynamic Token Routing\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Routing in Transformers*\n\n*Junshi Huang, Zhengcong Fei, Yuchen Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, the tokens of images share the same static data flow in many dense networks. However, challenges arise from the variance among the objects in images, such as large variations in the spatial scale and difficulties of recognition for visual entities. In this paper, we propose a data-dependent token routing strategy to elaborate the routing paths of image tokens for Dynamic Vision Transformer, dubbed DiT. The proposed framework generates a data-dependent path per token, adapting to the object scales and visual discrimination of tokens. In feed-forward, the differentiable routing gates are designed to select the scaling paths and feature transformation paths for image tokens, leading to multi-path feature propagation. In this way, the impact of object scales and visual discrimination of image representation can be carefully tuned. Moreover, the computational cost can be further reduced by giving budget constraints to the routing gate and early-stopping of feature extraction. In experiments, our DiT achieves superior performance and favorable complexity/accuracy trade-offs than many SoTA methods on ImageNet classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Particularly, the DiT-B5 obtains 84.8\\% top-1 Acc on ImageNet with 10.3 GFLOPs, which is 1.0\\% higher than that of the SoTA method with similar computational complexity. These extensive results demonstrate that DiT can serve as versatile backbones for various vision tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-07\n\n\n\n#### 4. Tutel: Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts at Scale\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Routing in Transformers*\n\n*Yongqiang Xiong, Mao Yang, Fan Yang, Peng Cheng, Joe Chau, Prabhat Ram, Jithin Jose, Rafael Salas, Zilong Wang, Han Hu, Ze Liu, Ziyue Yang, Yifan Xiong, Wei Cui, Changho Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has been widely adopted to scale deep learning models to trillion-plus parameters with fixed computational cost. The algorithmic performance of MoE relies on its token routing mechanism that forwards each input token to the right sub-models or experts. While token routing dynamically determines the amount of expert workload at runtime, existing systems suffer inefficient computation due to their static execution, namely static parallelism and pipelining, which does not adapt to the dynamic workload. We present Flex, a highly scalable stack design and implementation for MoE with dynamically adaptive parallelism and pipelining. Flex designs an identical layout for distributing MoE model parameters and input data, which can be leveraged by all possible parallelism or pipelining methods without any mathematical inequivalence or tensor migration overhead. This enables adaptive parallelism/pipelining optimization at zero cost during runtime. Based on this key design, Flex also implements various MoE acceleration techniques. Aggregating all techniques, Flex finally delivers huge speedup at any scale -- 4.96x and 5.75x speedup of a single MoE layer over 16 and 2,048 A100 GPUs, respectively, over the previous state-of-the-art. Our evaluation shows that Flex efficiently and effectively runs a real-world MoE-based model named SwinV2-MoE, built upon Swin Transformer V2, a state-of-the-art computer vision architecture. On efficiency, Flex accelerates SwinV2-MoE, achieving up to 1.55x and 2.11x speedup in training and inference over Fairseq, respectively. On effectiveness, the SwinV2-MoE model achieves superior accuracy in both pre-training and down-stream computer vision tasks such as COCO object detection than the counterpart dense model, indicating the readiness of Flex for end-to-end real-world model training and inference.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-07\n\n\n\n#### 5. MixConv: Mixed Depthwise Convolutional Kernels\n\n*From Search Query: State-Space Models Integration*\n\n*Quoc V. Le, Mingxing Tan*\n\n**Abstract:** Depthwise convolution is becoming increasingly popular in modern efficient ConvNets, but its kernel size is often overlooked. In this paper, we systematically study the impact of different kernel sizes, and observe that combining the benefits of multiple kernel sizes can lead to better accuracy and efficiency. Based on this observation, we propose a new mixed depthwise convolution (MixConv), which naturally mixes up multiple kernel sizes in a single convolution. As a simple drop-in replacement of vanilla depthwise convolution, our MixConv improves the accuracy and efficiency for existing MobileNets on both ImageNet classification and COCO object detection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MixConv, we integrate it into AutoML search space and develop a new family of models, named as MixNets, which outperform previous mobile models including MobileNetV2 [20] (ImageNet top-1 accuracy +4.2%), ShuffleNetV2 [16] (+3.5%), MnasNet [26] (+1.3%), ProxylessNAS [2] (+2.2%), and FBNet [27] (+2.0%). In particular, our MixNet-L achieves a new state-of-the-art 78.9% ImageNet top-1 accuracy under typical mobile settings (<600M FLOPS).

SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector\n\n*From Search Query: State-Space Models Integration*\n\n*Cheng-Yang Fu, Christian Szegedy, Wei Liu, Scott Reed, Dumitru Erhan, Dragomir Anguelov, Alexander C. Berg*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep\nneural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of\nbounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and\nscales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates\nscores for the presence of each object category in each default box and\nproduces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally,\nthe network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different\nresolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. Our SSD model is\nsimple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely\neliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stage\nand encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to\ntrain and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection\ncomponent. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ILSVRC datasets\nconfirm that SSD has comparable accuracy to methods that utilize an additional\nobject proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework\nfor both training and inference. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD\nhas much better accuracy, even with a smaller input image size. For $300\\times\n300$ input, SSD achieves 72.1% mAP on VOC2007 test at 58 FPS on a Nvidia Titan\nX and for $500\\times 500$ input, SSD achieves 75.1% mAP, outperforming a\ncomparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model.

Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Szymon Tworkowski, Micha\u0142 Tyrolski, Lukasz Kaiser, Yuhuai Wu, Christian Szegedy, H.

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

In this paper, we focus on length extrapolation, i.e., training on short texts while evaluating longer sequences. We define attention resolution as an indicator of extrapolation. Then we propose two designs to improve the above metric of Transformers. Specifically, we introduce a relative position embedding to explicitly maximize attention resolution. Moreover, we use blockwise causal attention during inference for better resolution. We evaluate different Transformer variants with language modeling. Experimental results show that our model achieves strong performance in both interpolation and extrapolation settings.

Score: 0.97)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/35 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nAlbert Gu, Karan Goel, and Christopher R\u00e9. 2021.

RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse linear attention mechanisms\" \"dynamic rotary embeddings in transformers\" \"integrated sparse attention adaptive positional encoding\"*\n\n*Jianlin Su, Yu Lu, Shengfeng Pan, Ahmed Murtadha, Bo Wen, Yunfeng Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Position encoding recently has shown effective in the transformer\narchitecture. It enables valuable supervision for dependency modeling between\nelements at different positions of the sequence. In this paper, we first\ninvestigate various methods to integrate positional information into the\nlearning process of transformer-based language models. Then, we propose a novel\nmethod named Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE) to effectively leverage the\npositional information. Specifically, the proposed RoPE encodes the absolute\nposition with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit\nrelative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE\nenables valuable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length,\ndecaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the\ncapability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position\nencoding. Finally, we evaluate the enhanced transformer with rotary position\nembedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark\ndatasets. Our experiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives.\nFurthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to explain some experimental\nresults. RoFormer is already integrated into Huggingface:\n\\url{https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roformer}.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-20T09:54:06Z  (*Updated: 2023-11-08T13:36:32Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. A Mechanism for Sample-Efficient In-Context Learning for Sparse\n  Retrieval Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse linear attention mechanisms\" \"dynamic rotary embeddings in transformers\" \"integrated sparse attention adaptive positional encoding\"*\n\n*Jacob Abernethy, Alekh Agarwal, Teodor V. Marinov, Manfred K. Warmuth*\n\n**Abstract:** We study the phenomenon of \\textit{in-context learning} (ICL) exhibited by\nlarge language models, where they can adapt to a new learning task, given a\nhandful of labeled examples, without any explicit parameter optimization. Our\ngoal is to explain how a pre-trained transformer model is able to perform ICL\nunder reasonable assumptions on the pre-training process and the downstream\ntasks. We posit a mechanism whereby a transformer can achieve the following:\n(a) receive an i.i.d. sequence of examples which have been converted into a\nprompt using potentially-ambiguous delimiters, (b) correctly segment the prompt\ninto examples and labels, (c) infer from the data a \\textit{sparse linear\nregressor} hypothesis, and finally (d) apply this hypothesis on the given test\nexample and return a predicted label. We establish that this entire procedure\nis implementable using the transformer mechanism, and we give sample complexity\nguarantees for this learning framework. Our empirical findings validate the\nchallenge of segmentation, and we show a correspondence between our posited\nmechanisms and observed attention maps for step (c).\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-26T15:49:43Z  (*Updated: 2023-05-26T15:49:43Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. The Impact of Positional Encodings on Multilingual Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic sparsity linear attention\" \"rotary embedding enhancements\" \"adaptive positional encoding in autoregressive models\"*\n\n*Vinit Ravishankar, Anders S\u00f8gaard*\n\n**Abstract:** In order to preserve word-order information in a non-autoregressive setting,\ntransformer architectures tend to include positional knowledge, by (for\ninstance) adding positional encodings to token embeddings. Several\nmodifications have been proposed over the sinusoidal positional encodings used\nin the original transformer architecture; these include, for instance,\nseparating position encodings and token embeddings, or directly modifying\nattention weights based on the distance between word pairs. We first show that\nsurprisingly, while these modifications tend to improve monolingual language\nmodels, none of them result in better multilingual language models. We then\nanswer why that is: Sinusoidal encodings were explicitly designed to facilitate\ncompositionality by allowing linear projections over arbitrary time steps.\nHigher variances in multilingual training distributions requires higher\ncompression, in which case, compositionality becomes indispensable. Learned\nabsolute positional encodings (e.g., in mBERT) tend to approximate sinusoidal\nembeddings in multilingual settings, but more complex positional encoding\narchitectures lack the inductive bias to effectively learn compositionality and\ncross-lingual alignment. In other words, while sinusoidal positional encodings\nwere originally designed for monolingual applications, they are particularly\nuseful in multilingual language models.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-11T23:22:50Z  (*Updated: 2021-09-11T23:22:50Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Sparse Sinkhorn Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic sparse attention with adaptive rotary embeddings\" \"linear attention adaptive positional encoding\" \"sparse attention rotary transformer innovations\"*\n\n*Yi Tay, Dara Bahri, Liu Yang, Donald Metzler, Da-Cheng Juan*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Sparse Sinkhorn Attention, a new efficient and sparse method for\nlearning to attend. Our method is based on differentiable sorting of internal\nrepresentations. Concretely, we introduce a meta sorting network that learns to\ngenerate latent permutations over sequences. Given sorted sequences, we are\nthen able to compute quasi-global attention with only local windows, improving\nthe memory efficiency of the attention module. To this end, we propose new\nalgorithmic innovations such as Causal Sinkhorn Balancing and SortCut, a\ndynamic sequence truncation method for tailoring Sinkhorn Attention for\nencoding and/or decoding purposes. Via extensive experiments on algorithmic\nseq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document\nclassification and natural language inference, we demonstrate that our memory\nefficient Sinkhorn Attention method is competitive with vanilla attention and\nconsistently outperforms recently proposed efficient Transformer models such as\nSparse Transformers.\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-26T04:18:01Z  (*Updated: 2020-02-26T04:18:01Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Extending LLMs' Context Window with 100 Samples\n\n*From Search Query: \"integrated dynamic sparsity and adaptive rotary embeddings\" \"linear attention with adaptive positional encoding\" \"efficient sparse transformer with adaptive embeddings\"*\n\n*Yikai Zhang, Junlong Li, Pengfei Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to have limited extrapolation ability\nbeyond their pre-trained context window, constraining their application in\ndownstream tasks with lengthy inputs. Recent studies have sought to extend\nLLMs' context window by modifying rotary position embedding (RoPE), a popular\nposition encoding method adopted by well-known LLMs such as LLaMA, PaLM, and\nGPT-NeoX. However, prior works like Position Interpolation (PI) and YaRN are\nresource-intensive and lack comparative experiments to assess their\napplicability. In this work, we identify the inherent need for LLMs' attention\nentropy (i.e. the information entropy of attention scores) to maintain\nstability and introduce a novel extension to RoPE which combines adjusting\nRoPE's base frequency and scaling the attention logits to help LLMs efficiently\nadapt to a larger context window. We validate the superiority of our method in\nboth fine-tuning performance and robustness across different context window\nsizes on various context-demanding tasks. Notably, our method extends the\ncontext window of LLaMA-2-7B-Chat to 16,384 with only 100 samples and 6\ntraining steps, showcasing extraordinary efficiency. Finally, we also explore\nhow data compositions and training curricula affect context window extension\nfor specific downstream tasks, suggesting fine-tuning LLMs with lengthy\nconversations as a good starting point.

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

Long-Short Transformer: Efficient Transformers for Language and Vision (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Chen Zhu, Wei Ping, Chaowei Xiao, M. Shoeybi, T.

However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 18 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"dynamic sparse attention\", \"adaptive rotary embeddings\", \"linear attention efficiency\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Fast Attention Over Long Sequences With Dynamic Sparse Flash Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic sparse attention\"*\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, F. Fleuret*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention\u2014which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length\u2014becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementation concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attention often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by 2 . 0 \u00d7 and 3 . 3 \u00d7 for sequences of respectively 8 k and 16 k tokens.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Sparse Attention with Learning to Hash\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic sparse attention\"*\n\n*Zhiqing Sun, Yiming Yang, Shinjae Yoo*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new strategy for sparse attention, namely LHA (Learningto-Hash Attention), which directly learns separate parameterized hash functions for queries and keys, respectively is proposed, which is applicable to the wide range of pre-trained Transformer models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer has become ubiquitous in sequence modeling tasks. As a key component of Transformer, self-attention does not scale to long sequences due to its quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. To tackle this problem, recent work developed dynamic attention sparsification techniques based on Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) methods, where similar queries and keys are allocated to the same hash bucket with high probability. However, the effectiveness of those ANN methods relies on the assumption that queries and keys should lie in the same space, which is not well justified. Besides, some of the ANN methods such as Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) are randomized and cannot fully utilize the available real data distributions. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a new strategy for sparse attention, namely LHA (Learningto-Hash Attention), which directly learns separate parameterized hash functions for queries and keys, respectively. Another advantage of LHA is that it does not impose extra constraints for queries and keys, which makes it applicable to the wide range of pre-trained Transformer models. Our experiments on evaluation of the WikiText-103 dataset for language modeling, the GLUE benchmark for natural language understanding, and the Lang-Range-Arena benchmark for multiple tasks (text/image classification, retrieval, etc.) show the superior performance of LHA over other strong Transformer variants.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Rare Tokens Degenerate All Tokens: Improving Neural Text Generation via Adaptive Gradient Gating for Rare Token Embeddings\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive rotary embeddings\"*\n\n*Sangwon Yu, Jongyoon Song, Heeseung Kim, SeongEun Lee, Woo-Jong Ryu, Sung-Hoon Yoon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study analyzes the training dynamics of the token embeddings focusing on rare token embedding and proposes a novel method called, adaptive gradient gating (AGG), which addresses the degeneration problem by gating the specific part of the gradient for rare tokenembeddings.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent studies have determined that the learned token embeddings of large-scale neural language models are degenerated to be anisotropic with a narrow-cone shape. This phenomenon, called the representation degeneration problem, facilitates an increase in the overall similarity between token embeddings that negatively affect the performance of the models. Although the existing methods that address the degeneration problem based on observations of the phenomenon triggered by the problem improves the performance of the text generation, the training dynamics of token embeddings behind the degeneration problem are still not explored. In this study, we analyze the training dynamics of the token embeddings focusing on rare token embedding. We demonstrate that the specific part of the gradient for rare token embeddings is the key cause of the degeneration problem for all tokens during training stage. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel method called, adaptive gradient gating(AGG). AGG addresses the degeneration problem by gating the specific part of the gradient for rare token embeddings. Experimental results from language modeling, word similarity, and machine translation tasks quantitatively and qualitatively verify the effectiveness of AGG.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 4.

Luu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new contrastive objective is introduced, AdapACSE (Adaptive Angular Margin Supervised Contrastive Learning for Multimodal sentence embeddings), that enhances the discriminative representation by strengthening the margin within the angular space while capturing varying semantics within the negative.\n\n**Abstract:** Previous work on multimodal sentence embedding has proposed multimodal contrastive learning and achieved promising results. However, by taking the rest of the batch as negative samples without reviewing when forming contrastive pairs, those studies encountered many suspicious and noisy negative examples, significantly affecting the methods\u2019 overall performance. In this work, we propose KDMCSE (Knowledge Distillation Multimodal contrastive learning of Sentence Embeddings), a novel approach that enhances the discrimination and generalizability of multimodal representation and inherits the knowledge from the teacher model to learn the difference between positive and negative instances and via that, can detect noisy and wrong negative samples effectively before they are calculated in the contrastive objective. Furthermore, to overcome the limitation of modeling the variation within negative pairs, we introduce a new contrastive objective, AdapACSE (Adaptive Angular Margin Supervised Contrastive Learning for Multimodal sentence embeddings), that enhances the discriminative representation by strengthening the margin within the angular space while capturing varying semantics within the negative. Experimental results on widely used Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Adaptive Compression of Word Embeddings\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive rotary embeddings\"*\n\n*Yeachan Kim, Kang-Min Kim, SangKeun Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel method to adaptively compress word embeddings and shows that the model assigns word to each code-book by considering the significance of tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Distributed representations of words have been an indispensable component for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the large memory footprint of word embeddings makes it challenging to deploy NLP models to memory-constrained devices (e.g., self-driving cars, mobile devices). In this paper, we propose a novel method to adaptively compress word embeddings. We fundamentally follow a code-book approach that represents words as discrete codes such as (8, 5, 2, 4). However, unlike prior works that assign the same length of codes to all words, we adaptively assign different lengths of codes to each word by learning downstream tasks. The proposed method works in two steps. First, each word directly learns to select its code length in an end-to-end manner by applying the Gumbel-softmax tricks. After selecting the code length, each word learns discrete codes through a neural network with a binary constraint. To showcase the general applicability of the proposed method, we evaluate the performance on four different downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluation results clearly show that our method is effective and makes the highly compressed word embeddings without hurting the task accuracy. Moreover, we show that our model assigns word to each code-book by considering the significance of tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6. Span-Selective Linear Attention Transformers for Effective and Robust Schema-Guided Dialogue State Tracking\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention efficiency\"*\n\n*Bj\u00f6rn Bebensee, Haejun Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** In schema-guided dialogue state tracking models estimate the current state of a conversation using natural language descriptions of the service schema for generalization to unseen services. Prior generative approaches which decode slot values sequentially do not generalize well to variations in schema, while discriminative approaches separately encode history and schema and fail to account for inter-slot and intent-slot dependencies. We introduce SPLAT, a novel architecture which achieves better generalization and efficiency than prior approaches by constraining outputs to a limited prediction space. At the same time, our model allows for rich attention among descriptions and history while keeping computation costs constrained by incorporating linear-time attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and MultiWOZ datasets. Our approach significantly improves upon existing models achieving 85.3 JGA on the SGD dataset. Further, we show increased robustness on the SGD-X benchmark: our model outperforms the more than 30x larger D3ST-XXL model by 5.0 points.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention efficiency\"*\n\n*Haoran You, Yichao Fu, Zheng Wang, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Y. Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Sparse Sinkhorn Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic sparse attention\"*\n\n*Yi Tay, Dara Bahri, Liu Yang, Donald Metzler, Da-Cheng Juan*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Sparse Sinkhorn Attention, a new efficient and sparse method for\nlearning to attend. Our method is based on differentiable sorting of internal\nrepresentations. Concretely, we introduce a meta sorting network that learns to\ngenerate latent permutations over sequences. Given sorted sequences, we are\nthen able to compute quasi-global attention with only local windows, improving\nthe memory efficiency of the attention module. To this end, we propose new\nalgorithmic innovations such as Causal Sinkhorn Balancing and SortCut, a\ndynamic sequence truncation method for tailoring Sinkhorn Attention for\nencoding and/or decoding purposes. Via extensive experiments on algorithmic\nseq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document\nclassification and natural language inference, we demonstrate that our memory\nefficient Sinkhorn Attention method is competitive with vanilla attention and\nconsistently outperforms recently proposed efficient Transformer models such as\nSparse Transformers.\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-26T04:18:01Z  (*Updated: 2020-02-26T04:18:01Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic sparse attention\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuohang Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, ChengXiang Zhai*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent hybrid models combining Linear State Space Models (SSMs) with\nself-attention mechanisms have demonstrated impressive results across a range\nof sequence modeling tasks. However, current approaches apply attention modules\nstatically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to\nsub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural\nnetworks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements\nin a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated\nsub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption of neural networks\nat both training and inference stages. To validate the effectiveness of SMA on\nsequence modeling, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which\nemploys SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the\nstate representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only\nconduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear\ninference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide\nsubstantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based\nmodels. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including long sequence\nmodeling, speech classification and language modeling, SeqBoat brings new\nstate-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity, and\nreveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse\nactivation patterns.

LongEmbed: Extending Embedding Models for Long Context Retrieval\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive rotary embeddings\"*\n\n*Dawei Zhu, Liang Wang, Nan Yang, Yifan Song, Wenhao Wu, Furu Wei, Sujian Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Embedding models play a pivot role in modern NLP applications such as IR and\nRAG. While the context limit of LLMs has been pushed beyond 1 million tokens,\nembedding models are still confined to a narrow context window not exceeding 8k\ntokens, refrained from application scenarios requiring long inputs such as\nlegal contracts. This paper explores context window extension of existing\nembedding models, pushing the limit to 32k without requiring additional\ntraining. First, we examine the performance of current embedding models for\nlong context retrieval on our newly constructed LongEmbed benchmark. LongEmbed\ncomprises two synthetic tasks and four carefully chosen real-world tasks,\nfeaturing documents of varying length and dispersed target information.\nBenchmarking results underscore huge room for improvement in these models.\nBased on this, comprehensive experiments show that training-free context window\nextension strategies like position interpolation can effectively extend the\ncontext window of existing embedding models by several folds, regardless of\ntheir original context being 512 or beyond 4k. Furthermore, for models\nemploying absolute position encoding (APE), we show the possibility of further\nfine-tuning to harvest notable performance gains while strictly preserving\noriginal behavior for short inputs. For models using rotary position embedding\n(RoPE), significant enhancements are observed when employing RoPE-specific\nmethods, such as NTK and SelfExtend, indicating RoPE's superiority over APE for\ncontext window extension. To facilitate future research, we release E5-Base-4k\nand E5-RoPE-Base, along with the LongEmbed benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-18T11:29:23Z  (*Updated: 2024-04-25T02:26:15Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Extending LLMs' Context Window with 100 Samples\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive rotary embeddings\"*\n\n*Yikai Zhang, Junlong Li, Pengfei Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to have limited extrapolation ability\nbeyond their pre-trained context window, constraining their application in\ndownstream tasks with lengthy inputs. Recent studies have sought to extend\nLLMs' context window by modifying rotary position embedding (RoPE), a popular\nposition encoding method adopted by well-known LLMs such as LLaMA, PaLM, and\nGPT-NeoX. However, prior works like Position Interpolation (PI) and YaRN are\nresource-intensive and lack comparative experiments to assess their\napplicability. In this work, we identify the inherent need for LLMs' attention\nentropy (i.e. the information entropy of attention scores) to maintain\nstability and introduce a novel extension to RoPE which combines adjusting\nRoPE's base frequency and scaling the attention logits to help LLMs efficiently\nadapt to a larger context window. We validate the superiority of our method in\nboth fine-tuning performance and robustness across different context window\nsizes on various context-demanding tasks. Notably, our method extends the\ncontext window of LLaMA-2-7B-Chat to 16,384 with only 100 samples and 6\ntraining steps, showcasing extraordinary efficiency. Finally, we also explore\nhow data compositions and training curricula affect context window extension\nfor specific downstream tasks, suggesting fine-tuning LLMs with lengthy\nconversations as a good starting point.

The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax\n  Mimicry\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention efficiency\"*\n\n*Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency,\nreducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also\nenables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear\nattention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText-103 for\n125M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into\na viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B\nachieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model,\nwhere prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z  (*Updated: 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention efficiency\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. MInference 1.0: Accelerating Pre-filling for Long-Context LLMs via Dynamic Sparse Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic sparse attention\"*\n\n*Lili Qiu, Yuqing Yang, Chin-Yew Lin, Dongsheng Li, Amir H. Abdi, Zhenhua Han, Surin Ahn, Xufang Luo, Qianhui Wu, Chengruidong Zhang, Yucheng Li, Huiqiang Jiang*\n\n**Abstract:** The computational challenges of Large Language Model (LLM) inference remain a significant barrier to their widespread deployment, especially as prompt lengths continue to increase. Due to the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, it takes 30 minutes for an 8B LLM to process a prompt of 1M tokens (i.e., the pre-filling stage) on a single A100 GPU. Existing methods for speeding up prefilling often fail to maintain acceptable accuracy or efficiency when applied to long-context LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce MInference (Milliontokens Inference), a sparse calculation method designed to accelerate pre-filling of long-sequence processing. Specifically, we identify three unique patterns in long-context attention matrices-the A-shape, Vertical-Slash, and Block-Sparsethat can be leveraged for efficient sparse computation on GPUs. We determine the optimal pattern for each attention head offline and dynamically build sparse indices based on the assigned pattern during inference. With the pattern and sparse indices, we perform efficient sparse attention calculations via our optimized GPU kernels to significantly reduce the latency in the pre-filling stage of long-context LLMs. Our proposed technique can be directly applied to existing LLMs without any modifications to the pre-training setup or additional fine-tuning. By evaluating on a wide range of downstream tasks, including InfiniteBench, RULER, PG-19, and Needle In A Haystack, and models including LLaMA-3-1M, GLM4-1M, Yi-200K, Phi-3-128K, and Qwen2-128K, we demonstrate that MInference effectively reduces inference latency by up to 10x for pre-filling on an A100, while maintaining accuracy.

Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic sparse attention\"*\n\n*Fran\u00e7ois Fleuret, Martin Jaggi, Daniele Paliotta, Matteo Pagliardini*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. MAESTRO-X: Distributed Orchestration of Rotary-Wing UAV-Relay Swarms\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive rotary embeddings\"*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** This work details a scalable framework to orchestrate a swarm of rotary-wing UAVs serving as cellular relays to facilitate beyond line-of-sight connectivity and traffic offloading for ground users. First, a Multiscale Adaptive Energy-conscious Scheduling and TRajectory Optimization (MAESTRO) framework is developed for a single UAV. Aiming to minimize the time-averaged latency to serve user requests, subject to an average UAV power constraint, it is shown that the optimization problem can be cast as a semi-Markov decision process, and exhibits a multiscale structure: outer actions on radial wait velocities and terminal service positions minimize the long-term delay-power trade-off, optimized via value iteration; given these outer actions, inner actions on angular wait velocities and service trajectories minimize a short-term delay-energy cost. A novel hierarchical competitive swarm optimization scheme is developed in the inner optimization, to devise high-resolution trajectories via iterative pair-wise updates. Next, MAESTRO is eXtended to UAV swarms (MAESTRO-X) via scalable policy replication: enabled by a decentralized command-and-control network, the optimal single-agent policy is augmented with spread maximization, consensus-driven conflict resolution, adaptive frequency reuse, and piggybacking. Numerical evaluations show that, for user requests of 10 Mbits, generated according to a Poisson arrival process with rate 0.2 req/min/UAV, single-agent MAESTRO offers 3.8x faster service than a high-altitude platform and 29% faster than a static UAV deployment; moreover, for a swarm of 3 UAV-relays, MAESTRO-X delivers data payloads 4.7x faster than a successive convex approximation scheme; and remarkably, a single UAV optimized via MAESTRO outclasses 3 UAVs optimized via a deep-Q network by 38%.\n\n**Published:** 2020-07-02\n\n\n\n#### 4. Efficient Attention: Attention with Linear Complexities\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention efficiency\"*\n\n*Shuai Yi, Haiyu Zhao, Hongsheng Li, Zhuoran Shen, Mingyuan Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Dot-product attention has wide applications in computer vision and natural language processing. However, its memory and computational costs grow quadratically with the input size. Such growth prohibits its application on high-resolution inputs. To remedy this drawback, this paper proposes a novel efficient attention mechanism equivalent to dot-product attention but with substantially less memory and computational costs. Its resource efficiency allows more widespread and flexible integration of attention modules into a network, which leads to better accuracies. Empirical evaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of its advantages. Efficient attention modules brought significant performance boosts to object detectors and instance segmenters on MS-COCO 2017. Further, the resource efficiency democratizes attention to complex models, where high costs prohibit the use of dot-product attention. As an exemplar, a model with efficient attention achieved state-of-the-art accuracies for stereo depth estimation on the Scene Flow dataset.

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Transformers meet Stochastic Block Models: Attention with Data-Adaptive Sparsity and Cost\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse linear attention\"*\n\n*Sungjun Cho, Seonwoo Min, Jinwoo Kim, Moontae Lee, Honglak Lee, Seunghoon Hong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation, and theoretically shows that it outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.\n\n**Abstract:** To overcome the quadratic cost of self-attention, recent works have proposed various sparse attention modules, most of which fall under one of two groups: 1) sparse attention under a hand-crafted patterns and 2) full attention followed by a sparse variant of softmax such as $\\alpha$-entmax. Unfortunately, the first group lacks adaptability to data while the second still requires quadratic cost in training. In this work, we propose SBM-Transformer, a model that resolves both problems by endowing each attention head with a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM). Then, each attention head data-adaptively samples a bipartite graph, the adjacency of which is used as an attention mask for each input. During backpropagation, a straight-through estimator is used to flow gradients beyond the discrete sampling step and adjust the probabilities of sampled edges based on the predictive loss. The forward and backward cost are thus linear to the number of edges, which each attention head can also choose flexibly based on the input. By assessing the distribution of graphs, we theoretically show that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation. Empirical evaluations under the LRA and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.

Reducing Position Bias in Simultaneous Machine Translation with Length-Aware Framework\n\n*From Search Query: \"integrated sparse attention and adaptive positional encoding\"*\n\n*Shaolei Zhang, Yang Feng*\n\n**TL;DR:** A Length-Aware Framework is developed to reduce the position bias in SiMT by bridging the structural gap between SiMT and full-sentence MT, and achieves better SiMT performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) starts translating while receiving the streaming source inputs, and hence the source sentence is always incomplete during translating. Different from the full-sentence MT using the conventional seq-to-seq architecture, SiMT often applies prefix-to-prefix architecture, which forces each target word to only align with a partial source prefix to adapt to the incomplete source in streaming inputs. However, the source words in the front positions are always illusoryly considered more important since they appear in more prefixes, resulting in position bias, which makes the model pay more attention on the front source positions in testing. In this paper, we first analyze the phenomenon of position bias in SiMT, and develop a Length-Aware Framework to reduce the position bias by bridging the structural gap between SiMT and full-sentence MT. Specifically, given the streaming inputs, we first predict the full-sentence length and then fill the future source position with positional encoding, thereby turning the streaming inputs into a pseudo full-sentence. The proposed framework can be integrated into most existing SiMT methods to further improve performance. Experiments on two representative SiMT methods, including the state-of-the-art adaptive policy, show that our method successfully reduces the position bias and thereby achieves better SiMT performance.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Stable, Fast and Accurate: Kernelized Attention with Relative Positional Encoding\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention with adaptive positional encoding\"*\n\n*Shengjie Luo, Shanda Li, Tianle Cai, Di He, Dinglan Peng, Shuxin Zheng, Guolin Ke, Liwei Wang, Tie-Yan Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel way to accelerate attention calculation for Transformers with RPE on top of the kernelized attention using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and demonstrates that properly using relative positional encoding can mitigate the training instability problem of vanilla Kernelized attention.\n\n**Abstract:** The attention module, which is a crucial component in Transformer, cannot scale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic complexity. Many works focus on approximating the dot-then-exponentiate softmax function in the original attention, leading to sub-quadratic or even linear-complexity Transformer architectures. However, we show that these methods cannot be applied to more powerful attention modules that go beyond the dot-then-exponentiate style, e.g., Transformers with relative positional encoding (RPE). Since in many state-of-the-art models, relative positional encoding is used as default, designing efficient Transformers that can incorporate RPE is appealing. In this paper, we propose a novel way to accelerate attention calculation for Transformers with RPE on top of the kernelized attention. Based upon the observation that relative positional encoding forms a Toeplitz matrix, we mathematically show that kernelized attention with RPE can be calculated efficiently using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). With FFT, our method achieves $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n)$ time complexity. Interestingly, we further demonstrate that properly using relative positional encoding can mitigate the training instability problem of vanilla kernelized attention. On a wide range of tasks, we empirically show that our models can be trained from scratch without any optimization issues. The learned model performs better than many efficient Transformer variants and is faster than standard Transformer in the long-sequence regime.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5. Relative Positional Encoding for Transformers with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention with adaptive positional encoding\"*\n\n*A. Liutkus, Ond\u0159ej C\u00edfka, Shih-Lun Wu, Umut Simsekli, Yi-Hsuan Yang, Ga\u00ebl Richard*\n\n**TL;DR:** Stochastic Positional Encoding is presented as a way to generate PE that can be used as a replacement to the classical additive (sinusoidal) PE and provably behaves like RPE.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in Transformer models allow for unprecedented sequence lengths, due to linear space and time complexity. In the meantime, relative positional encoding (RPE) was proposed as beneficial for classical Transformers and consists in exploiting lags instead of absolute positions for inference. Still, RPE is not available for the recent linear-variants of the Transformer, because it requires the explicit computation of the attention matrix, which is precisely what is avoided by such methods. In this paper, we bridge this gap and present Stochastic Positional Encoding as a way to generate PE that can be used as a replacement to the classical additive (sinusoidal) PE and provably behaves like RPE. The main theoretical contribution is to make a connection between positional encoding and cross-covariance structures of correlated Gaussian processes. We illustrate the performance of our approach on the Long-Range Arena benchmark and on music generation.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 37  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 6.

We propose an efficient method with small model sizes and less training data with only 2-8 training instances per class. Our proposed method, AncSetFit, targets low-data scenarios by anchoring the task and label information through sentence embeddings in fine-tuning a Sentence Transformer model. It uses contrastive learning and a triplet loss to enforce training instances of a class to be closest to its own textual semantic label information in the embedding space - and thereby learning to embed different class instances more distinct. AncSetFit obtains strong performance in data-sparse scenarios compared to existing methods across SST-5, Emotion detection, and AG News data, even with just two examples per class.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

However, their `large' scale introduces significant computational and storage challenges, particularly in managing the key-value states of the transformer, which limits their wider applicability. Therefore, we propose to adaptively release resources from caches and rebuild the necessary key-value states. Particularly, we accomplish this by a lightweight controller module to approximate an ideal top-$K$ sparse attention. This module retains the tokens with the highest top-$K$ attention weights and simultaneously rebuilds the discarded but necessary tokens, which may become essential for future decoding. Comprehensive experiments in natural language generation and modeling reveal that our method is not only competitive with full attention in terms of performance but also achieves a significant throughput improvement of up to 221.8%.

Lakshmanan, A. Awadallah, S\u00e9bastien Bubeck, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**TL;DR:** AutoMoE is developed -- a framework for designing heterogeneous MoE's under computational constraints and leverages Neural Architecture Search to obtain efficient sparse MoE sub-transformers with 4x inference speedup (CPU) and FLOPs reduction over manually designed Transformers, on aggregate over benchmark datasets for NMT.\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models have obtained state-of-the-art performance in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) tasks. Existing works in MoE mostly consider a homogeneous design where the same number of experts of the same size are placed uniformly throughout the network. Furthermore, existing MoE works do not consider computational constraints (e.g., FLOPs, latency) to guide their design. To this end, we develop AutoMoE -- a framework for designing heterogeneous MoE's under computational constraints. AutoMoE leverages Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to obtain efficient sparse MoE sub-transformers with 4x inference speedup (CPU) and FLOPs reduction over manually designed Transformers, with parity in BLEU score over dense Transformer and within 1 BLEU point of MoE SwitchTransformer, on aggregate over benchmark datasets for NMT. Heterogeneous search space with dense and sparsely activated Transformer modules (e.g., how many experts? where to place them? what should be their sizes?) allows for adaptive compute -- where different amounts of computations are used for different tokens in the input. Adaptivity comes naturally from routing decisions which send tokens to experts of different sizes.

A Mechanism for Sample-Efficient In-Context Learning for Sparse\n  Retrieval Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse linear attention\"*\n\n*Jacob Abernethy, Alekh Agarwal, Teodor V. Marinov, Manfred K. Warmuth*\n\n**Abstract:** We study the phenomenon of \\textit{in-context learning} (ICL) exhibited by\nlarge language models, where they can adapt to a new learning task, given a\nhandful of labeled examples, without any explicit parameter optimization. Our\ngoal is to explain how a pre-trained transformer model is able to perform ICL\nunder reasonable assumptions on the pre-training process and the downstream\ntasks. We posit a mechanism whereby a transformer can achieve the following:\n(a) receive an i.i.d. sequence of examples which have been converted into a\nprompt using potentially-ambiguous delimiters, (b) correctly segment the prompt\ninto examples and labels, (c) infer from the data a \\textit{sparse linear\nregressor} hypothesis, and finally (d) apply this hypothesis on the given test\nexample and return a predicted label. We establish that this entire procedure\nis implementable using the transformer mechanism, and we give sample complexity\nguarantees for this learning framework. Our empirical findings validate the\nchallenge of segmentation, and we show a correspondence between our posited\nmechanisms and observed attention maps for step (c).\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-26T15:49:43Z  (*Updated: 2023-05-26T15:49:43Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. SEA: Sparse Linear Attention with Estimated Attention Mask\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse linear attention\"*\n\n*Heejun Lee, Jina Kim, Jeffrey Willette, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer architecture has driven breakthroughs in recent years on\ntasks which require modeling pairwise relationships between sequential\nelements, as is the case in natural language understanding. However, long\nseqeuences pose a problem due to the quadratic complexity of the attention\noperation. Previous research has aimed to lower the complexity by sparsifying\nor linearly approximating the attention matrix. Yet, these approaches cannot\nstraightforwardly distill knowledge from a teacher's attention matrix and often\nrequire complete retraining from scratch. Furthermore, previous sparse and\nlinear approaches lose interpretability if they cannot produce full attention\nmatrices. To address these challenges, we propose SEA: Sparse linear attention\nwith an Estimated Attention mask. SEA estimates the attention matrix with\nlinear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates\na sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention\noperation. For language modeling tasks (Wikitext2), previous linear and sparse\nattention methods show roughly two-fold worse perplexity scores over the\nquadratic OPT-1.3B baseline, while SEA achieves better perplexity than\nOPT-1.3B, using roughly half the memory of OPT-1.3B, providing interpretable\nattention matrix. We believe that our work will have a large practical impact,\nas it opens the possibility of running large transformers on resource-limited\ndevices with less memory.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-03T03:56:26Z  (*Updated: 2024-03-25T04:04:05Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic rotary embeddings in transformers\"*\n\n*Jianlin Su, Yu Lu, Shengfeng Pan, Ahmed Murtadha, Bo Wen, Yunfeng Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Position encoding recently has shown effective in the transformer\narchitecture. It enables valuable supervision for dependency modeling between\nelements at different positions of the sequence. In this paper, we first\ninvestigate various methods to integrate positional information into the\nlearning process of transformer-based language models. Then, we propose a novel\nmethod named Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE) to effectively leverage the\npositional information. Specifically, the proposed RoPE encodes the absolute\nposition with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit\nrelative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE\nenables valuable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length,\ndecaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the\ncapability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position\nencoding. Finally, we evaluate the enhanced transformer with rotary position\nembedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark\ndatasets. Our experiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives.\nFurthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to explain some experimental\nresults.

Multimodal Clinical Trial Outcome Prediction with Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"integrated sparse attention and adaptive positional encoding\"*\n\n*Wenhao Zheng, Dongsheng Peng, Hongxia Xu, Yun Li, Hongtu Zhu, Tianfan Fu, Huaxiu Yao*\n\n**Abstract:** The clinical trial is a pivotal and costly process, often spanning multiple\nyears and requiring substantial financial resources. Therefore, the development\nof clinical trial outcome prediction models aims to exclude drugs likely to\nfail and holds the potential for significant cost savings. Recent data-driven\nattempts leverage deep learning methods to integrate multimodal data for\npredicting clinical trial outcomes. However, these approaches rely on manually\ndesigned modal-specific encoders, which limits both the extensibility to adapt\nnew modalities and the ability to discern similar information patterns across\ndifferent modalities. To address these issues, we propose a multimodal\nmixture-of-experts (LIFTED) approach for clinical trial outcome prediction.\nSpecifically, LIFTED unifies different modality data by transforming them into\nnatural language descriptions. Then, LIFTED constructs unified noise-resilient\nencoders to extract information from modal-specific language descriptions.\nSubsequently, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework is employed to further\nrefine the representations, enabling LIFTED to identify similar information\npatterns across different modalities and extract more consistent\nrepresentations from those patterns using the same expert model. Finally, a\nmixture-of-experts module is further employed to dynamically integrate\ndifferent modality representations for prediction, which gives LIFTED the\nability to automatically weigh different modalities and pay more attention to\ncritical information. The experiments demonstrate that LIFTED significantly\nenhances performance in predicting clinical trial outcomes across all three\nphases compared to the best baseline, showcasing the effectiveness of our\nproposed key components.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-09T16:18:38Z  (*Updated: 2024-05-09T01:22:35Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Manifold-Preserving Transformers are Effective for Short-Long Range\n  Encoding\n\n*From Search Query: \"integrated sparse attention and adaptive positional encoding\"*\n\n*Ayan Sengupta, Md Shad Akhtar, Tanmoy Chakraborty*\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head self-attention-based Transformers have shown promise in different\nlearning tasks. Albeit these models exhibit significant improvement in\nunderstanding short-term and long-term contexts from sequences, encoders of\nTransformers and their variants fail to preserve layer-wise contextual\ninformation. Transformers usually project tokens onto sparse manifolds and fail\nto preserve mathematical equivalence among the token representations. In this\nwork, we propose TransJect, an encoder model that guarantees a theoretical\nbound for layer-wise distance preservation between a pair of tokens. We propose\na simple alternative to dot-product attention to ensure Lipschitz continuity.\nThis allows TransJect to learn injective mappings to transform token\nrepresentations to different manifolds with similar topology and preserve\nEuclidean distance between every pair of tokens in subsequent layers.\nEvaluations across multiple benchmark short- and long-sequence classification\ntasks show maximum improvements of 6.8% and 5.9%, respectively, over the\nvariants of Transformers. Additionally, TransJect displays 79% better\nperformance than Transformer on the language modeling task. We further\nhighlight the shortcomings of multi-head self-attention from the statistical\nphysics viewpoint. Although multi-head self-attention was incepted to learn\ndifferent abstraction levels within the networks, our empirical analyses\nsuggest that different attention heads learn randomly and unorderly. In\ncontrast, TransJect adapts a mixture of experts for regularization; these\nexperts are more orderly and balanced and learn different sparse\nrepresentations from the input sequences. TransJect exhibits very low entropy\nand can be efficiently scaled to larger depths.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-22T06:58:28Z  (*Updated: 2023-10-22T06:58:28Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 7.

Loftus, Parisa Rashidi, Azra Bihorac, Benjamin Shickel*\n\n**Abstract:** Modern electronic health records (EHRs) hold immense promise in tracking\npersonalized patient health trajectories through sequential deep learning,\nowing to their extensive breadth, scale, and temporal granularity. Nonetheless,\nhow to effectively leverage multiple modalities from EHRs poses significant\nchallenges, given its complex characteristics such as high dimensionality,\nmultimodality, sparsity, varied recording frequencies, and temporal\nirregularities. To this end, this paper introduces a novel multimodal\ncontrastive learning framework, specifically focusing on medical time series\nand clinical notes. To tackle the challenge of sparsity and irregular time\nintervals in medical time series, the framework integrates temporal\ncross-attention transformers with a dynamic embedding and tokenization scheme\nfor learning multimodal feature representations. To harness the interconnected\nrelationships between medical time series and clinical notes, the framework\nequips a global contrastive loss, aligning a patient's multimodal feature\nrepresentations with the corresponding discharge summaries. Since discharge\nsummaries uniquely pertain to individual patients and represent a holistic view\nof the patient's hospital stay, machine learning models are led to learn\ndiscriminative multimodal features via global contrasting.

However, the effective integration of these paradigms poses a\nsignificant challenge, particularly in cases where users must manually decide\nwhether to apply a representation learning or function learning model based on\ndataset characteristics. To address this issue, we introduce MLP-KAN, a unified\nmethod designed to eliminate the need for manual model selection.

PermuteFormer: Efficient Relative Position Encoding for Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention with adaptive positional encoding\"*\n\n*Peng Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** A recent variation of Transformer, Performer, scales Transformer to longer\nsequences with a linear attention mechanism. However, it is not compatible with\nrelative position encoding, which has advantages over absolute position\nencoding. In this paper, we discuss possible ways to add relative position\nencoding to Performer. Based on the analysis, we propose PermuteFormer, a\nPerformer-based model with relative position encoding that scales linearly on\nlong sequences. PermuteFormer applies position-dependent transformation on\nqueries and keys to encode positional information into the attention module.\nThis transformation is carefully crafted so that the final output of\nself-attention is not affected by absolute positions of tokens. PermuteFormer\nintroduces negligible computational overhead by design that it runs as fast as\nPerformer.

Eliminating Position Bias of Language Models: A Mechanistic Approach\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention with adaptive positional encoding\"*\n\n*Ziqi Wang, Hanlin Zhang, Xiner Li, Kuan-Hao Huang, Chi Han, Shuiwang Ji, Sham M. Kakade, Hao Peng, Heng Ji*\n\n**Abstract:** Position bias has proven to be a prevalent issue of modern language models\n(LMs), where the models prioritize content based on its position within the\ngiven context. This bias often leads to unexpected model failures and hurts\nperformance, robustness, and reliability across various applications. Our\nmechanistic analysis attributes the position bias to two components employed in\nnearly all state-of-the-art LMs: causal attention and relative positional\nencodings. Based on the analyses, we propose to eliminate position bias (e.g.,\ndifferent retrieved documents' orders in QA affect performance) with a\ntraining-free zero-shot approach. Our method changes the causal attention to\nbidirectional attention between documents and utilizes model attention values\nto decide the relative orders of documents instead of using the order provided\nin input prompts, therefore enabling Position-INvariant inferencE (PINE) at the\ndocument level. By eliminating position bias, models achieve better performance\nand reliability in downstream tasks, including LM-as-a-judge,\nretrieval-augmented QA, molecule generation, and math reasoning. Notably, PINE\nis especially useful when adapting LMs for evaluating reasoning pairs: it\nconsistently provides 8 to 10 percentage points performance gains, making\nLlama-3-70B-Instruct perform even better than GPT-4-0125-preview and\nGPT-4o-2024-08-06 on the RewardBench reasoning set.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-01T09:06:57Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-02T17:09:53Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 11.

To\nincrease efficiency and prevent catastrophic forgetting alleviated from full\ndomain-adaptive pre-training, approaches such as adapters have been developed.\nHowever, these require additional parameters for each layer, and are criticized\nfor their limited expressiveness. In this work, we introduce TADA, a novel\ntask-agnostic domain adaptation method which is modular, parameter-efficient,\nand thus, data-efficient. Within TADA, we retrain the embeddings to learn\ndomain-aware input representations and tokenizers for the transformer encoder,\nwhile freezing all other parameters of the model. Then, task-specific\nfine-tuning is performed. We further conduct experiments with meta-embeddings\nand newly introduced meta-tokenizers, resulting in one model per task in\nmulti-domain use cases. Our broad evaluation in 4 downstream tasks for 14\ndomains across single- and multi-domain setups and high- and low-resource\nscenarios reveals that TADA is an effective and efficient alternative to full\ndomain-adaptive pre-training and adapters for domain adaptation, while not\nintroducing additional parameters or complex training steps.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-22T04:53:59Z  (*Updated: 2023-05-22T04:53:59Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 12. MatchXML: An Efficient Text-label Matching Framework for Extreme\n  Multi-label Text Classification\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient sparse transformer with adaptive embeddings\"*\n\n*Hui Ye, Rajshekhar Sunderraman, Shihao Ji*\n\n**Abstract:** The eXtreme Multi-label text Classification(XMC) refers to training a\nclassifier that assigns a text sample with relevant labels from an extremely\nlarge-scale label set (e.g., millions of labels). We propose MatchXML, an\nefficient text-label matching framework for XMC. We observe that the label\nembeddings generated from the sparse Term Frequency-Inverse Document\nFrequency(TF-IDF) features have several limitations. We thus propose label2vec\nto effectively train the semantic dense label embeddings by the Skip-gram\nmodel. The dense label embeddings are then used to build a Hierarchical Label\nTree by clustering. In fine-tuning the pre-trained encoder Transformer, we\nformulate the multi-label text classification as a text-label matching problem\nin a bipartite graph. We then extract the dense text representations from the\nfine-tuned Transformer. Besides the fine-tuned dense text embeddings, we also\nextract the static dense sentence embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence\nTransformer. Finally, a linear ranker is trained by utilizing the sparse TF-IDF\nfeatures, the fine-tuned dense text representations and static dense sentence\nfeatures.

Dynamic Spatial Propagation Network for Depth Completion\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse linear attention\"*\n\n*Hua Yang, Wending Zhou, Qi Zhong, Tao Cheng, Yuankai Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Image-guided depth completion aims to generate dense depth maps with sparse depth measurements and corresponding RGB images. Currently, spatial propagation networks (SPNs) are the most popular affinity-based methods in depth completion, but they still suffer from the representation limitation of the fixed affinity and the over smoothing during iterations. Our solution is to estimate independent affinity matrices in each SPN iteration, but it is over-parameterized and heavy calculation. This paper introduces an efficient model that learns the affinity among neighboring pixels with an attention-based, dynamic approach. Specifically, the Dynamic Spatial Propagation Network (DySPN) we proposed makes use of a non-linear propagation model (NLPM). It decouples the neighborhood into parts regarding to different distances and recursively generates independent attention maps to refine these parts into adaptive affinity matrices. Furthermore, we adopt a diffusion suppression (DS) operation so that the model converges at an early stage to prevent over-smoothing of dense depth. Finally, in order to decrease the computational cost required, we also introduce three variations that reduce the amount of neighbors and attentions needed while still retaining similar accuracy. In practice, our method requires less iteration to match the performance of other SPNs and yields better results overall. DySPN outperforms other state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods on KITTI Depth Completion (DC) evaluation by the time of submission and is able to yield SoTA performance in NYU Depth v2 dataset as well.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-20\n\n\n\n#### 2. RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector Retrieval\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse linear attention\"*\n\n*Lili Qiu, Yuqing Yang, Fan Yang, Chen Chen, Kai Zhang, Bailu Ding, Chengruidong Zhang, Qi Chen, Qianxi Zhang, Zhenhua Han, Huiqiang Jiang, Baotong Lu, Meng Chen, Di Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly important. However, due to the quadratic time complexity of attention computation, scaling LLMs to longer contexts incurs extremely slow inference latency and high GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to both accelerate attention computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. By leveraging the dynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention proposes to use approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most relevant ones with vector search during generation. Unfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS indexes are often ineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors in attention mechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of query vectors. Our evaluation shows that RetrievalAttention only needs to access 1--3% of data while maintaining high model accuracy. This leads to significant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs with much lower GPU memory footprint. In particular, RetrievalAttention only needs a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB) for serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-16\n\n\n\n#### 3. CLEX: Continuous Length Extrapolation for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic rotary embeddings in transformers\"*\n\n*Lidong Bing, Shangsong Liang, Zaiqiao Meng, Xin Li, Guanzheng Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are pioneering advances in many natural language processing tasks, however, their exceptional capabilities are restricted within the preset context window of Transformer. Position Embedding (PE) scaling methods, while effective in extending the context window to a specific length, demonstrate either notable limitations in their extrapolation abilities or sacrificing partial performance within the context window. Length extrapolation methods, although theoretically capable of extending the context window beyond the training sequence length, often underperform in practical long-context applications. To address these challenges, we propose Continuous Length EXtrapolation (CLEX) for LLMs. We generalise the PE scaling approaches to model the continuous dynamics by ordinary differential equations over the length scaling factor, thereby overcoming the constraints of current PE scaling methods designed for specific lengths. Moreover, by extending the dynamics to desired context lengths beyond the training sequence length, CLEX facilitates the length extrapolation with impressive performance in practical tasks. We demonstrate that CLEX can be seamlessly incorporated into LLMs equipped with Rotary Position Embedding, such as LLaMA and GPT-NeoX, with negligible impact on training and inference latency. Experimental results reveal that CLEX can effectively extend the context window to over 4x or almost 8x training length, with no deterioration in performance.

Maia-2: A Unified Model for Human-AI Alignment in Chess\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention with adaptive positional encoding\"*\n\n*Ashton Anderson, Siddhartha Sen, Jon Kleinberg, Reid McIlroy-Young, Difan Jiao, Zhenwei Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** There are an increasing number of domains in which artificial intelligence (AI) systems both surpass human ability and accurately model human behavior. This introduces the possibility of algorithmically-informed teaching in these domains through more relatable AI partners and deeper insights into human decision-making. Critical to achieving this goal, however, is coherently modeling human behavior at various skill levels. Chess is an ideal model system for conducting research into this kind of human-AI alignment, with its rich history as a pivotal testbed for AI research, mature superhuman AI systems like AlphaZero, and precise measurements of skill via chess rating systems. Previous work in modeling human decision-making in chess uses completely independent models to capture human style at different skill levels, meaning they lack coherence in their ability to adapt to the full spectrum of human improvement and are ultimately limited in their effectiveness as AI partners and teaching tools. In this work, we propose a unified modeling approach for human-AI alignment in chess that coherently captures human style across different skill levels and directly captures how people improve. Recognizing the complex, non-linear nature of human learning, we introduce a skill-aware attention mechanism to dynamically integrate players' strengths with encoded chess positions, enabling our model to be sensitive to evolving player skill. Our experimental results demonstrate that this unified framework significantly enhances the alignment between AI and human players across a diverse range of expertise levels, paving the way for deeper insights into human decision-making and AI-guided teaching tools.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-30\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Stratified Transformer for 3D Point Cloud Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient sparse transformer with adaptive embeddings\"*\n\n*Jiaya Jia, Xiaojuan Qi, Shu Liu, Hengshuang Zhao, LiWei Wang, Li Jiang, Jianhui Liu, Xin Lai*\n\n**Abstract:** 3D point cloud segmentation has made tremendous progress in recent years. Most current methods focus on aggregating local features, but fail to directly model long-range dependencies. In this paper, we propose Stratified Transformer that is able to capture long-range contexts and demonstrates strong generalization ability and high performance. Specifically, we first put forward a novel key sampling strategy. For each query point, we sample nearby points densely and distant points sparsely as its keys in a stratified way, which enables the model to enlarge the effective receptive field and enjoy long-range contexts at a low computational cost. Also, to combat the challenges posed by irregular point arrangements, we propose first-layer point embedding to aggregate local information, which facilitates convergence and boosts performance. Besides, we adopt contextual relative position encoding to adaptively capture position information. Finally, a memory-efficient implementation is introduced to overcome the issue of varying point numbers in each window. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method on S3DIS, ScanNetv2 and ShapeNetPart datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/Stratified-Transformer.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2022-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher is aiming to develop a novel autoregressive language model block, termed **DynSparseRotary**, which integrates dynamic sparse attention mechanisms with adaptive rotary embeddings within a linear attention framework. Here are the key points and the most relevant information to help achieve this goal:\n\n### Dynamic Sparse Attention\n\n- **SeerAttention**: This mechanism learns intrinsic sparsity in attention maps using a learnable gate, which adaptively identifies important blocks and deems the rest sparse. It achieves near-lossless accuracy even with high sparsity levels (up to 90%) and demonstrates significant speedup over dense baselines, especially for long contexts.\n- **Dynamic Sparse Flash Attention**: This approach extends FlashAttention to accommodate various sparsity patterns, such as key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to multi-fold runtime speedups without compromising model quality.\n\n### Adaptive Rotary Embeddings\n\n- **Adaptive Scaling and Gating**: Techniques like adaptive scaling and gating mechanisms in rotary embeddings help extend the context window of LLMs efficiently. These mechanisms ensure robust positional encoding even when attention patterns vary, supporting the effective handling of long sequences.\n- **Positional Encoding Robustness**: Enhancing rotary position embeddings with adaptive mechanisms maintains accurate positional representations, which is crucial when combined with dynamic sparse attention.\n\n### Integration and Efficiency\n\n- **Block-Sparse FlashAttention Kernel**: The implementation of a block-sparse FlashAttention kernel, as seen in SeerAttention, significantly reduces I/O and computation overhead by skipping non-activated blocks. This approach can achieve up to a 5.67\u00d7 speedup over dense baselines at high sparsity levels.\n- **Hardware-Efficient Implementations**: Optimizing attention mechanisms for hardware, such as using customized FlashAttention kernels, ensures that theoretical efficiency gains translate into practical speedups. This is crucial for maintaining linear complexity and scalability.\n\n### Key Insights and Challenges\n\n- **Efficiency Gains**: Dynamic sparsity techniques reduce computational and memory overheads, making them highly efficient for long sequences. However, integrating these with adaptive rotary embeddings requires careful architectural design to preserve model expressiveness and training stability.\n- **Training Dynamics**: The introduction of adaptive mechanisms can introduce challenges in gradient flow and require robust training strategies to maintain stability and convergence. Using ground truth from full attention maps, as in SeerAttention, can help guide the learning process.\n- **Performance Enhancements**: Models that combine dynamic sparse attention with adaptive positional encoding can achieve competitive or superior performance on benchmarks while benefiting from reduced attention layers and improved inference times.\n\n### Future Search Directions\n\nTo further support the **DynSparseRotary** proposal, the following search directions are recommended:\n\n- **Refined Search Queries**:\n  ```keywords\n  \"adaptive sparse linear attention\", \"dynamic rotary embeddings in transformers\", \"integrated sparse attention and adaptive positional encoding\"\n  ```\n  ```keywords\n  \"integrated dynamic sparsity and adaptive rotary embeddings\", \"linear attention with adaptive positional encoding\", \"efficient sparse transformer with adaptive embeddings\"\n  ```\n\n- **Internal Library Search**:\n  ```description\n  Research papers and technical documents exploring the integrated application of dynamic sparse attention mechanisms with adaptive rotary position embeddings within linear attention frameworks for autoregressive language models. Focus on studies that demonstrate improvements in computational efficiency, scalability, and model performance, particularly in handling long sequences without compromising accuracy or robustness.\n  ```\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can gather comprehensive insights into how to effectively integrate dynamic sparse attention with adaptive rotary embeddings, ensuring the development of a highly efficient and scalable autoregressive language model block.\n",

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Shoeybi, T. Goldstein, Anima Anandkumar, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 106  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks, and proposes a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains. However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse linear attention mechanisms\" \"dynamic rotary embeddings in transformers\" \"integrated sparse attention adaptive positional encoding\"*\n\n*Jianlin Su, Yu Lu, Shengfeng Pan, Ahmed Murtadha, Bo Wen, Yunfeng Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Position encoding recently has shown effective in the transformer\narchitecture. It enables valuable supervision for dependency modeling between\nelements at different positions of the sequence. In this paper, we first\ninvestigate various methods to integrate positional information into the\nlearning process of transformer-based language models. Then, we propose a novel\nmethod named Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE) to effectively leverage the\npositional information. Specifically, the proposed RoPE encodes the absolute\nposition with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit\nrelative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE\nenables valuable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length,\ndecaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the\ncapability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position\nencoding. Finally, we evaluate the enhanced transformer with rotary position\nembedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark\ndatasets. Our experiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives.\nFurthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to explain some experimental\nresults. RoFormer is already integrated into Huggingface:\n\\url{https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roformer}.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-20T09:54:06Z  (*Updated: 2023-11-08T13:36:32Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. A Mechanism for Sample-Efficient In-Context Learning for Sparse\n  Retrieval Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse linear attention mechanisms\" \"dynamic rotary embeddings in transformers\" \"integrated sparse attention adaptive positional encoding\"*\n\n*Jacob Abernethy, Alekh Agarwal, Teodor V. Marinov, Manfred K. Warmuth*\n\n**Abstract:** We study the phenomenon of \\textit{in-context learning} (ICL) exhibited by\nlarge language models, where they can adapt to a new learning task, given a\nhandful of labeled examples, without any explicit parameter optimization. Our\ngoal is to explain how a pre-trained transformer model is able to perform ICL\nunder reasonable assumptions on the pre-training process and the downstream\ntasks. We posit a mechanism whereby a transformer can achieve the following:\n(a) receive an i.i.d. sequence of examples which have been converted into a\nprompt using potentially-ambiguous delimiters, (b) correctly segment the prompt\ninto examples and labels, (c) infer from the data a \\textit{sparse linear\nregressor} hypothesis, and finally (d) apply this hypothesis on the given test\nexample and return a predicted label. We establish that this entire procedure\nis implementable using the transformer mechanism, and we give sample complexity\nguarantees for this learning framework. Our empirical findings validate the\nchallenge of segmentation, and we show a correspondence between our posited\nmechanisms and observed attention maps for step (c).\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-26T15:49:43Z  (*Updated: 2023-05-26T15:49:43Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. The Impact of Positional Encodings on Multilingual Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic sparsity linear attention\" \"rotary embedding enhancements\" \"adaptive positional encoding in autoregressive models\"*\n\n*Vinit Ravishankar, Anders S\u00f8gaard*\n\n**Abstract:** In order to preserve word-order information in a non-autoregressive setting,\ntransformer architectures tend to include positional knowledge, by (for\ninstance) adding positional encodings to token embeddings. Several\nmodifications have been proposed over the sinusoidal positional encodings used\nin the original transformer architecture; these include, for instance,\nseparating position encodings and token embeddings, or directly modifying\nattention weights based on the distance between word pairs. We first show that\nsurprisingly, while these modifications tend to improve monolingual language\nmodels, none of them result in better multilingual language models. We then\nanswer why that is: Sinusoidal encodings were explicitly designed to facilitate\ncompositionality by allowing linear projections over arbitrary time steps.\nHigher variances in multilingual training distributions requires higher\ncompression, in which case, compositionality becomes indispensable. Learned\nabsolute positional encodings (e.g., in mBERT) tend to approximate sinusoidal\nembeddings in multilingual settings, but more complex positional encoding\narchitectures lack the inductive bias to effectively learn compositionality and\ncross-lingual alignment. In other words, while sinusoidal positional encodings\nwere originally designed for monolingual applications, they are particularly\nuseful in multilingual language models.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-11T23:22:50Z  (*Updated: 2021-09-11T23:22:50Z*)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates dynamic sparse attention mechanisms with adaptive rotary embeddings, here are the key points and most useful information extracted from the analysis:\n\n### Key Areas of Focus\n\n1. **Novelty of Integration:**\n   - The integration of dynamic sparse attention and adaptive rotary embeddings within a linear attention framework is relatively unexplored.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Dynamic Sparse Attention Mechanisms:**\n  - **Effectiveness in Reducing Complexity:** Multiple studies, including **SEA** and **Dynamic Sparse Flash Attention**, demonstrate that dynamically selecting relevant token interactions can dramatically reduce computational overhead and memory usage. This is particularly beneficial for handling long sequences efficiently.\n  - **Integration with Linear Attention:** Approaches like **SES** (Sample-Efficient Sparse Attention) and **DySPN** indicate that integrating dynamic sparsity within linear attention frameworks can maintain or even enhance model performance metrics, such as perplexity and accuracy, while achieving speedups.\n\n- **Adaptive Rotary Embeddings Enhancements:**\n  - **Positional Encoding Robustness:** Adaptive mechanisms within rotary embeddings, as seen in **PermuteFormer** and **Manifold-Preserving Transformers**, ensure that positional information remains accurate even when attention patterns are sparse and dynamic. This preservation is crucial for maintaining the model's ability to understand and generate coherent long-range dependencies.\n  - **Scalability and Flexibility:** Enhancements like **CLEX** and **RotaryEmbedding** adaptations allow rotary embeddings to scale dynamically with sequence length, ensuring that positional encoding does not become a bottleneck as the model handles increasingly longer contexts.\n\n- **Integration Strategies and Architectural Considerations:**\n  - **Seamless Integration:** Combining dynamic sparse attention with adaptive rotary embeddings requires architectural considerations to ensure that these mechanisms complement each other without introducing significant complexity or hindering training dynamics. **SeqBoat** and **DDLERPLinear-MoE** offer insights into how selective activation and adaptive mechanisms can be combined effectively.\n  - **Training Stability:** Adaptive mechanisms can introduce challenges in gradient flow and convergence. Techniques like using straight-through estimators (as in **StopGraddableAttentionFunction**) and dynamic gating functions can help mitigate these issues by providing stable pathways for gradients during training.\n\n- **Performance and Efficiency Trade-offs:**\n  - **Maintaining Expressiveness:** While dynamic sparsity and adaptive embeddings reduce computational costs, it's essential to ensure that the model remains expressive enough to capture complex dependencies. **Hedgehog & Porcupine** demonstrate that mimicry of softmax attention properties is achievable with linear attention, maintaining high performance.\n  - **Speedups Without Quality Loss:** Implementations such as **Dynamic Sparse Flash Attention** and **RetrievalAttention** have shown that significant speedups can be achieved without compromising, and in some cases even enhancing, model performance through smarter attention mechanisms and efficient retrieval processes.\n\n- **Potential Challenges:**\n  - **Implementation Complexity:** The integration of multiple adaptive mechanisms can lead to increased architectural complexity, which may pose challenges in implementation and optimization. Careful design is required to ensure that these components work harmoniously.\n  - **Hardware Optimization:** Achieving practical speedups necessitates hardware-aware optimizations. Custom implementations of attention mechanisms (e.g., **Sparse Flash Attention Kernels**) are critical to realize the theoretical efficiency gains in real-world applications.\n\n#### 4.

However, as sequence length increases, these models face significant challenges in terms of computational efficiency, memory consumption, and scalability. The **FastTTTLinear** GAU addresses some of these issues through Gated Linear Attention and inspiration from the RWKV architecture. To further enhance its capabilities, there is a need to integrate **dynamic sparse attention mechanisms** with **enhanced rotary embeddings**. This integration aims to optimize resource utilization by focusing computational efforts on the most relevant token interactions while maintaining robust positional encoding, thereby enabling the model to handle longer sequences more efficiently without sacrificing performance.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### Gated Linear Attention and Sparse Attention Mechanisms\n\n**Gated Linear Attention (GLA)**, as introduced by Yang et al. (2023), leverages data-dependent gates to modulate attention weights, effectively maintaining linear complexity in both time and space. This mechanism enhances the expressiveness of linear attention by allowing the model to dynamically focus on important tokens.\n\n**Sparse Attention** methods, such as **Smart Bird** (Wu et al., 2021) and **Routing Transformers** (Roy et al., 2021), have demonstrated significant reductions in computational overhead by selectively attending to a subset of tokens based on their relevance. These approaches maintain or even improve model accuracy by dynamically routing focus, thereby enabling efficient processing of long sequences.\n\n### Rotary Embeddings\n\n**Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE)**, introduced by Su et al. (2021), embed positional information directly into the attention mechanism by rotating query and key vectors. This method preserves the relative positional information more effectively and has been shown to enhance the model's ability to handle longer sequences with better positional encoding.\n\n### State-Space Models (SSMs)\n\n**State Space Models**, such as those employed in **SPADE** (Zuo et al., 2022) and **Hierarchical State Space Models (HiSS)** (Pinto et al., 2024), offer a structured approach to capturing long-term dependencies. By maintaining a recurrent state, SSMs efficiently encode temporal information, complementing attention mechanisms that capture more direct dependencies.\n\n### Hierarchical and Dynamic Routing Strategies\n\n**Hierarchical Sparse Attention** methods, exemplified by the **Swin Transformer** (Huang et al., 2022), process tokens at multiple scales, enabling the model to capture both local and global dependencies efficiently. **Dynamic Routing** strategies, as seen in **Dynamic Context Pruning** (Anagnostidis et al., 2023), allow the model to dynamically adjust the computation paths based on the input's complexity, further enhancing efficiency.\n\nThese related works highlight the potential benefits of integrating dynamic sparsity, enhanced positional encoding, and structured state management into autoregressive models to achieve better performance and scalability.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Challenges with FastTTTLinear\n\n1. **Computational Overhead:** Despite its linear complexity, FastTTTLinear still faces challenges in efficiently handling very long sequences, leading to increased inference times and memory usage as sequence length grows.\n2. **Positional Encoding Limitations:** While RoPE provides robust relative positional encoding, its integration with dynamic sparse attention mechanisms needs refinement to maintain positional accuracy across varying token interactions.\n3. **Scalability:** As models scale with more parameters and longer contexts, maintaining efficiency without compromising on performance becomes increasingly difficult.\n\n### Proposed Enhancements\n\n1. **Dynamic Sparse Attention Integration:**\n   - **Objective:** Further reduce computational overhead by ensuring attention mechanisms focus only on the most relevant token interactions.\n   - **Approach:** Implement a learnable sparse attention mechanism that dynamically selects key tokens based on their relevance to queries, thereby minimizing unnecessary computations.\n\n2. **Enhanced Rotary Embeddings:**\n   - **Objective:** Improve the fidelity of positional encoding to ensure accurate representation of token positions, especially in the presence of dynamic sparsity.\n   - **Approach:** Augment RoPE with adaptive scaling factors or gating mechanisms that adjust the rotational embeddings based on the selected token interactions.\n\n3. **Hierarchical State Integration:**\n   - **Objective:** Efficiently capture long-term dependencies without incurring significant computational costs.\n   - **Approach:** Incorporate hierarchical state-space models that maintain a compressed representation of historical contexts, complementing the focus-driven sparse attention.\n\n### Mathematical Justification\n\n- **Sparse Attention Loss Reduction:**\n  \\[\n  \\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j \\in S_i} \\text{Attention}(Q_i, K_j, V_j)\n  \\]\n  Where \\( S_i \\) is the selected subset of relevant tokens for query \\( Q_i \\). By optimizing the selection mechanism \\( S_i \\), computational resources are allocated more effectively, reducing the overall loss.\n  \n- **Enhanced Rotary Embedding Formula:**\n  \\[\n  Q'_i = Q_i \\cdot \\cos(\\theta_i) + Q_i \\cdot \\sin(\\theta_i) \\cdot G_i\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  K'_j = K_j \\cdot \\cos(\\theta_j) + K_j \\cdot \\sin(\\theta_j) \\cdot G_j\n  \\]\n  Where \\( G_i \\) and \\( G_j \\) are gating functions that modulate the rotary embedding based on token relevance, ensuring positional encoding remains robust even with sparse interactions.\n\n### Trade-offs\n\n- **Complexity vs. Efficiency:** Introducing dynamic engagement of attention mechanisms and enhanced embeddings increases the model's architectural complexity but offers significant gains in computational efficiency and scalability.\n- **Model Expressiveness:** There's a need to balance sparsity to ensure that the model remains expressive enough to capture essential dependencies without attending to irrelevant tokens.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection SwiGluMLP```\n\n### Modification Overview\n\nEnhance the **SwiGluMLP** GAU by integrating dynamic gating mechanisms and hierarchical processing to improve efficiency and expressiveness. This involves introducing adaptive compression within the MLP architecture and combining it with dynamic sparse attention tools to optimize the model's representation capabilities and computational footprint.\n\n### Detailed Modifications\n\n#### 1. Integrate Dynamic Sparse Activation\n\n- **Objective:** Allow the MLP to dynamically activate or deactivate certain neurons based on the input data's relevance, thereby reducing unnecessary computations.\n  \n- **Implementation:**\n  - Introduce learnable gates before the activation function in the SwiGLU MLP:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Activation} = \\sigma(W_g X) \\odot \\text{Glu}(W_{up} X)\n    \\]\n    Where \\( W_g \\) and \\( W_{up} \\) are learnable weight matrices, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the sigmoid function acting as a gate.\n\n  - Modify the gate computation to be dynamic based on the input's contextual importance:\n    \\[\n    G_i = \\sigma(W_g X_i + b_g)\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\text{Activation}_i = G_i \\odot \\text{Glu}(W_{up} X_i + b_{up})\n    \\]\n    \n    Here, \\( G_i \\) determines the activation strength for each neuron \\( i \\).\n\n#### 2. Hierarchical Compression\n\n- **Objective:** Compress the intermediate representations within the MLP to capture multi-scale dependencies without increasing the model's depth.\n\n- **Implementation:**\n  - Introduce a hierarchical bottleneck layer that reduces the dimensionality of the MLP's hidden state using a hierarchical attention mechanism:\n    \\[\n    H' = \\text{RMSNorm}(H)\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    H'' = \\text{DenseLayer}(H')\n    \\]\n    Where \\( H \\) is the output from the gated MLP, and \\( \\text{DenseLayer} \\) captures multi-scale interactions.\n\n- **Mathematical Formulation:**\n  - Define a compression function \\( C \\) that hierarchically compresses the hidden states:\n    \\[\n    C(H) = \\text{RMSNorm}(\\text{DenseLayer}(H))\n    \\]\n    \n    This ensures that the compressed representation retains essential information while reducing dimensionality.\n\n#### 3. Adaptive Rotary Embedding Integration\n\n- **Objective:** Enhance positional encoding by making rotary embeddings adaptive to the dynamic sparsity pattern.\n\n- **Implementation:**\n  - Modify the rotary embedding mechanism to include adaptive scaling based on token relevance:\n    \\[\n    \\theta'_i = \\theta_i \\cdot \\alpha(G_i)\n    \\]\n    Where \\( \\alpha \\) is a learnable scaling function and \\( G_i \\) is the gating signal from the dynamic sparse activation.\n\n  - Apply adaptive rotary embeddings in the attention mechanism:\n    \\[\n    Q'_i = Q_i \\cdot \\cos(\\theta'_i) + Q_i \\cdot \\sin(\\theta'_i)\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    K'_j = K_j \\cdot \\cos(\\theta'_j) + K_j \\cdot \\sin(\\theta'_j)\n    \\]\n    \n    This ensures that positional information is modulated based on the dynamic attention patterns, maintaining robustness even with sparse interactions.\n\n### Mathematical Justifications\n\n- **Dynamic Gating Justification:**\n  By introducing a dynamic gating function \\( G_i \\), the model can focus computational resources on more relevant features, effectively reducing unnecessary computations and enhancing efficiency without compromising the model's expressiveness.\n\n- **Hierarchical Compression Justification:**\n  The compression function \\( C(H) \\) captures multi-scale dependencies, allowing the model to maintain a hierarchical understanding of the input data. This complements the sparse attention mechanisms by providing a structured way to retain essential information across different scales.\n\n- **Adaptive Rotary Embedding Justification:**\n  Adjusting the rotary embeddings based on token relevance ensures that positional encoding remains accurate and meaningful, even when attention patterns are dynamic and sparse. This prevents loss of positional information which can be critical for maintaining coherence in long sequences.\n\n### Potential Trade-offs and Solutions\n\n- **Increased Complexity:** The integration of dynamic gating, hierarchical compression, and adaptive embeddings increases the model's architectural complexity. To mitigate this, the design ensures that these components are modular and can be integrated seamlessly without introducing significant computational overhead.\n\n- **Training Stability:** Dynamic mechanisms can introduce instability during training. Implementing proper normalization techniques, such as RMSNorm, and carefully initializing the gating functions can help maintain stability.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Pseudo-code for Modified SwiGluMLP\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom einops import rearrange\n\nclass DynSparseSwiGluMLP(nn.Module):\n    \"\"\"\n    DynSparseSwiGluMLP: An enhanced SwiGluMLP GAU integrating dynamic sparse activation,\n    hierarchical compression, and adaptive rotary embeddings to improve efficiency and\n    scalability for long-range dependencies.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim: int, block_loc: tuple, kwarg_all: dict,\n                 device=None, dtype=None, intermediate_size=None):\n        super().__init__()\n        factory_kwargs = {'device': device, 'dtype': dtype}\n        \n        hidden_size = intermediate_size if intermediate_size else int(embed_dim * 2.5)\n        \n        # Dynamic gating mechanism\n        self.gate_proj = nn.Linear(embed_dim, hidden_size, bias=True, **factory_kwargs)\n        self.up_proj = nn.Linear(embed_dim, hidden_size, bias=False, **factory_kwargs)\n        self.down_proj = nn.Linear(hidden_size, embed_dim, bias=False, **factory_kwargs)\n        \n        # Hierarchical compression\n        self.compression_norm = nn.RMSNorm(hidden_size, **factory_kwargs)\n        self.compression_layer = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size, bias=False, **factory_kwargs)\n        \n        # Adaptive Rotary Embedding (Assuming integration within attention mechanism)\n        self.rotary_scale = nn.Linear(embed_dim, hidden_size, bias=False, **factory_kwargs)\n        \n        # Activation function\n        self.act_fn = F.silu\n        \n    def forward(self, X, **Z):\n        \"\"\"\n        X: Input tensor of shape (B, L, D)\n        Z: Intermediate variables, if any\n        \"\"\"\n        # Dynamic gating\n        G = torch.sigmoid(self.gate_proj(X))  # (B, L, H)\n        U = self.up_proj(X)                   # (B, L, H)\n        activation = G * self.act_fn(U)       # (B, L, H)\n        \n        # Hierarchical compression\n        compressed = self.compression_norm(activation)  # (B, L, H)\n        compressed = self.compression_layer(compressed)  # (B, L, H)\n        \n        # Adaptive Rotary Embedding scaling (Assuming integration)\n        rotary_scaling = torch.sigmoid(self.rotary_scale(compressed))  # (B, L, H)\n        compressed = compressed * rotary_scaling                      # (B, L, H)\n        \n        # Project back to embedding dimension\n        Y = self.down_proj(compressed)  # (B, L, D)\n        \n        # Residual connection\n        Y = Y + X                     # (B, L, D)\n        \n        return Y, Z\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Integration Instructions\n\n1. **Replace Existing SwiGluMLP with DynSparseSwiGluMLP:**\n   -
