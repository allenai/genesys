Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.",

Strengths of the Implementation\n\n- **Significant Performance Improvements**: The latest implementation of `FastTTTLinear` effectively addresses the previous inefficiency issues by fully vectorizing operations and eliminating Python-level for-loops. This refactoring aligns with best practices for leveraging PyTorch\u2019s optimized tensor operations, dramatically enhancing computational speed and scalability.\n\n- **Alignment with Proposal**: The GAU maintains strong adherence to the original proposal by integrating Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and incorporating concepts from the RWKV architecture. This ensures that the model's core objectives\u2014improving computational efficiency, scalability, and maintaining expressiveness\u2014are being met.\n\n- **Comprehensive Documentation**: The implementation continues to feature detailed docstrings that clearly describe the purpose, functionality, parameters, inputs, outputs, and references for each class. This thorough documentation enhances code readability and serves as valuable guidance for future developers and reviewers.\n\n- **Proper Parameter Initialization**: The use of Xavier (Glorot) initialization for linear layers and appropriate bias initializations ensures stable training dynamics. This practice helps in maintaining the variance of inputs throughout the network, preventing issues like exploding or vanishing gradients.\n\n- **Normalization Enhancements**: Incorporating both `LayerNorm` and `RMSNorm` within the GAU adds multiple layers of normalization, which stabilize training and improve gradient flow. This dual normalization approach contributes to the model\u2019s robustness and numerical stability.\n\n- **Successful Functionality Checks**: The implementation passed all functionality checks, including unit tests and whole model integration tests. This indicates that the GAU functions correctly within the larger language model, handling forward passes, backward passes, and maintaining causality without issues.\n\n### 3. Areas for Improvement and Specific Suggestions for Refinement or Optimization\n\n#### **A. Further Optimize Attention Computations**\n\nWhile the forward pass has been fully vectorized, there is still potential for optimizing the attention computations to further enhance performance:\n\n- **Efficient Use of `torch.einsum`**: The current implementation utilizes `torch.einsum` for computing tensor contractions, which is flexible but can be inefficient for certain operations. Consider replacing complex `einsum` operations with more optimized tensor operations where possible.\n\n  - **Example**:\n    ```python\n    numerator = Q * S_cumsum  # Currently used\n    # Alternative optimized operation (if applicable)\n    numerator = Q * S_cumsum  # Same as current; ensure it's implemented efficiently\n    ```\n\n- **Leverage Memory-Efficient Operations**: Investigate if alternative tensor operations can be used to reduce memory overhead and improve cache locality, leading to faster computations.\n\n#### **B. Implement Mixed Precision Training**\n\n- **Action**: Utilize PyTorch's Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) to accelerate training and reduce memory usage without significantly sacrificing model performance.\n\n  - **Example**:\n    ```python\n    scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()\n    for data, target in dataloader:\n        optimizer.zero_grad()\n        with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():\n            output, Z = fast_ttt_linear(data)\n            loss = loss_fn(output, target)\n        scaler.scale(loss).backward()\n        scaler.step(optimizer)\n        scaler.update()\n    ```\n\n- **Rationale**: Mixed precision training can lead to substantial speedups and allow for larger batch sizes, further enhancing scalability.\n\n#### **C. Explore Further Normalization Techniques**\n\n- **Action**: While the current implementation uses both `LayerNorm` and `RMSNorm`, consider experimenting with other normalization techniques or fine-tuning existing ones to further stabilize training and improve performance.\n\n  - **Example**:\n    ```python\n    self.custom_norm = SomeOtherNormLayer(...)\n    ```\n\n- **Rationale**: Different normalization methods can have varying impacts on training dynamics. Exploring alternatives may yield performance gains or increased stability.\n\n#### **D. Profiling and Benchmarking**\n\n- **Action**: Conduct thorough profiling using PyTorch\u2019s profiling tools to identify any remaining bottlenecks and validate the efficiency gains achieved through vectorization and other optimizations.\n\n  - **Example**:\n    ```python\n    with torch.profiler.profile(\n        activities=[torch.profiler.ProfilerActivity.CPU, torch.profiler.ProfilerActivity.CUDA],\n        schedule=torch.profiler.schedule(wait=1, warmup=1, active=3, repeat=2),\n        on_trace_ready=torch.profiler.tensorboard_trace_handler('./log'),\n        record_shapes=True,\n        profile_memory=True,\n        with_stack=True\n    ) as prof:\n        for step, (batch, labels) in enumerate(dataloader):\n            Y, Z = fast_ttt_linear(batch)\n            loss = loss_fn(Y, labels)\n            loss.backward()\n            optimizer.step()\n            optimizer.zero_grad()\n            if step >= (5 + 2 * 3) - 1:\n                break\n    print(prof.key_averages().table(sort_by=\"cuda_time_total\", row_limit=10))\n    ```\n\n- **Rationale**: Profiling provides insights into which operations are the most time-consuming, guiding further optimizations to maximize performance.\n\n#### **E. Implement Gradient Clipping**\n\n- **Action**: Introduce gradient clipping during training to prevent gradient explosions, enhancing model stability.\n\n  - **Example**:\n    ```python\n    torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(fast_ttt_linear.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)\n    ```\n\n- **Rationale**: Gradient clipping safeguards against excessively large gradients, which can destabilize training and lead to divergence.\n\n### 4. Comments on Innovation and Potential Impact\n\n**Innovation**:\n\n- **Integration of GLA and RWKV Concepts**: The combination of Gated Linear Attention with RWKV-inspired stateful representations is a pioneering approach. This integration aims to achieve linear computational complexity while maintaining the expressive capabilities necessary for capturing long-range dependencies in language modeling.\n\n- **Advanced Normalization Techniques**: By incorporating both `LayerNorm` and `RMSNorm`, the implementation leverages multiple normalization strategies to stabilize training and improve gradient flow, contributing to the model\u2019s robustness.\n\n- **Efficient Attention Mechanism**: The vectorized attention computation, as implemented, represents an efficient approach to handling long sequences without the computational overhead associated with traditional Transformer-based attention mechanisms.\n\n**Potential Impact**:\n\n- **Scalability Enhancements**: By achieving linear attention computation, `FastTTTLinear` significantly improves the model's ability to handle longer contexts, making it suitable for applications requiring extensive contextual understanding, such as document summarization or long-form question answering.\n\n- **Performance and Efficiency Gains**: The optimizations implemented accelerate training and inference, enabling faster experimentation and deployment. This efficiency makes the model more accessible for real-time applications and environments with limited computational resources.\n\n- **Robustness and Flexibility**: The model\u2019s ability to integrate test-time training provisions allows it to adapt dynamically during inference, potentially improving performance across diverse and evolving datasets.\n\n**Concerns**:\n\n- **Complexity Management**: The intricate combination of various components (GLA, RWKV concepts, multiple normalization layers) introduces additional complexity. Ensuring that each component operates harmoniously is crucial to prevent subtle bugs or performance issues.\n\n- **Integration Stability**: While functionality checks have passed, continuous monitoring is essential to ensure that future modifications or extensions do not disrupt the established GAU hierarchy or introduce new inefficiencies.\n\n### 5. *[Omitted Since All Checks Passed]*\n\n### 6.

The successful passage of functionality checks underscores the GAU's correctness and integration within the larger language model framework. However, achieving the full potential of this GAU requires ongoing optimizations, particularly in attention computations and training efficiency. By implementing the suggested refinements and maintaining rigorous testing and profiling practices, the `FastTTTLinear` GAU can evolve into a highly efficient and scalable component, significantly contributing to the language model's overall performance and robustness.\n\nContinued collaboration, iterative testing, and a focus on performance optimization will be essential in overcoming the remaining challenges and fully realizing the innovative potential of the `FastTTTLinear` GAU.",

The use of learnable gates (`gate_proj`) and the hierarchical compression mechanism (`compression_norm` and `compression_layer`) aligns with the intended design.\n\n- **Comprehensive Documentation**: The docstrings provided are detailed and informative, explaining the purpose, key features, arguments, inputs, outputs, examples, and references. This enhances the readability and maintainability of the code.\n\n- **Code Clarity and Structure**: The code is well-organized and follows a clear structure, making it easier to understand the flow of computations within the GAU. The use of descriptive variable names and adherence to coding standards improves code quality.\n\n### Areas for Improvement and Specific Suggestions\n\n1. **Missing Adaptive Rotary Embedding Integration**:\n\n   - **Issue**: The implementation does not include the **adaptive rotary embedding scaling** component, which was a crucial part of the proposal's modifications to the `SwiGluMLP` GAU.\n   - **Suggestion**: Incorporate the `rotary_scale` layer into the GAU. Add the following to the `__init__` method:\n     ```python\n     self.rotary_scale = nn.Linear(self.intermediate_size, self.intermediate_size, bias=False, **self.factory_kwargs)\n     ```\n     And modify the `_forward` method to include:\n     ```python\n     rotary_scaling = torch.sigmoid(self.rotary_scale(compressed))\n     compressed = compressed * rotary_scaling\n     ```\n     This ensures that the positional encoding is adaptively scaled based on the compressed activations, maintaining robustness in dynamic sparse patterns.\n\n2. **Declaration of Child GAUs**:\n\n   - **Issue**: The `CHILDREN_DECLARATIONS` section is missing, and the `RMSNorm` used in `compression_norm` is not declared as a child GAU.\n   - **Suggestion**: Add a `CHILDREN_DECLARATIONS` list at the end of your code to declare `RMSNorm` as a child GAU:\n     ```python\n     CHILDREN_DECLARATIONS = [\n         UnitDecl(\n             unitname=\"RMSNorm\",\n             requirements=\"Applies root mean square layer normalization.\",\n             inputs=[\"X\"],\n             outputs=[\"Y\"]\n         ),\n     ]\n     ```\n     This enhances modularity and ensures proper integration within the hierarchical GAU structure.\n\n3. **Missing Unit Tests**:\n\n   - **Issue**: No unit tests are provided for the `SwiGluMLP` GAU, which are essential for verifying functionality and correctness.\n   - **Suggestion**: Implement a unit test function following the template:\n     ```python\n     @gau_test\n     def test_swiglu_mlp(device=None, dtype=None) -> None:\n         embed_dim = 128\n         batch_size = 2\n         seq_len = 16\n         X = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim, device=device, dtype=dtype)\n         swiglu_mlp = SwiGluMLP(embed_dim=embed_dim, block_loc=(0, 0), kwarg_all={}, device=device, dtype=dtype)\n         Y, Z = swiglu_mlp(X)\n         assert Y.shape == X.shape, f\"Expected output shape {X.shape}, got {Y.shape}\"\n     ```\n     This test checks that the output shape matches the input shape and that the GAU runs without errors.\n\n4. **Summary of Changes**:\n\n   - **Issue**: The implementation lacks a summary of changes made by the coder.\n   - **Suggestion**: Provide a brief summary outlining how the `SwiGluMLP` was modified according to the proposal, highlighting the integration of dynamic sparse activation, hierarchical compression, and (after inclusion) adaptive rotary embeddings.\n\n5. **Consistent Use of Factory Keyword Arguments**:\n\n   - **Issue**: In some places, `**kwarg_all` is used redundantly when `self.factory_kwargs` already contains the required device and dtype.\n   - **Suggestion**: Review the initialization of layers to ensure that `self.factory_kwargs` is used consistently without unnecessary duplication, for example:\n     ```python\n     self.compression_norm = RMSNorm(\n         embed_dim=self.intermediate_size,\n         block_loc=block_loc,\n         kwarg_all=kwarg_all,\n         **self.factory_kwargs\n     )\n     ```\n\n### Comments on Innovation and Potential Impact\n\n- **Enhanced Efficiency and Expressiveness**: The integration of dynamic sparse activation and hierarchical compression has the potential to improve computational efficiency by reducing unnecessary computations and capturing multi-scale dependencies. This can lead to faster training and inference times, especially for long sequences.\n\n- **Scalability**: By efficiently managing computational resources, the modified `SwiGluMLP` can contribute to better scalability of the language model, allowing it to handle larger datasets and more complex tasks without a proportional increase in computational cost.\n\n- **Integration with Existing GAUs**: Once the adaptive rotary embedding scaling is included, the GAU will align more closely with the proposal, ensuring compatibility and synergy with other components of the model that utilize positional encodings.\n\n### Recommendations for the Coder\n\n1. **Include Adaptive Rotary Embedding Scaling**: Integrate the adaptive rotary embedding scaling as outlined in the proposal to complete the implementation and fully realize the intended enhancements.\n\n2. **Declare Child GAUs**: Add the necessary `CHILDREN_DECLARATIONS` to declare `RMSNorm` and any other GAUs used within `SwiGluMLP`. This practice ensures modularity and clarity in the model's hierarchical structure.\n\n3. **Implement Unit Tests**: Write comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of `SwiGluMLP`. Tests should cover various input shapes, data types, and edge cases to ensure robustness.\n\n4. **Provide a Summary of Changes**: Document the modifications made to `SwiGluMLP`, highlighting how they address the objectives outlined in the proposal. This aids in understanding the implementation and its alignment with the design plan.\n\n5. **Review and Optimize Code**: Perform a thorough review of the code to identify any redundant or unnecessary components. Ensure that all layers and operations are essential and contribute to the GAU's functionality.\n\n6. **Prepare for Integration**: Consider how `SwiGluMLP` will integrate with the larger model, including potential interactions with other GAUs and the overall data flow. Ensure that the interfaces and data formats are consistent.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Testing with Real Data**: After implementing the unit tests, evaluate the GAU using real or synthetic data representative of actual use cases. Analyze performance metrics to assess improvements in efficiency and expressiveness.\n\n- **Performance Profiling**: Profile the GAU to identify any bottlenecks or areas where computational efficiency can be further enhanced. This may involve optimizing certain operations or utilizing more efficient implementations.\n\n- **Documentation Updates**: Update the docstrings and comments to reflect any additional changes made during refinement. Ensure that all explanations are accurate and helpful for future developers and reviewers.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the implementation of `SwiGluMLP` will be more robust, fully aligned with the proposal, and better prepared for integration into the larger language model. This will contribute to achieving the team's goals of improved performance, efficiency, and scalability in the novel autoregressive language model.",

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.",

Strengths of the Implementation\n\n- **Significant Performance Improvements**: The latest implementation of `FastTTTLinear` effectively addresses the previous inefficiency issues by fully vectorizing operations and eliminating Python-level for-loops. This refactoring aligns with best practices for leveraging PyTorch\u2019s optimized tensor operations, dramatically enhancing computational speed and scalability.\n\n- **Alignment with Proposal**: The GAU maintains strong adherence to the original proposal by integrating Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and incorporating concepts from the RWKV architecture. This ensures that the model's core objectives\u2014improving computational efficiency, scalability, and maintaining expressiveness\u2014are being met.\n\n- **Comprehensive Documentation**: The implementation continues to feature detailed docstrings that clearly describe the purpose, functionality, parameters, inputs, outputs, and references for each class. This thorough documentation enhances code readability and serves as valuable guidance for future developers and reviewers.\n\n- **Proper Parameter Initialization**: The use of Xavier (Glorot) initialization for linear layers and appropriate bias initializations ensures stable training dynamics. This practice helps in maintaining the variance of inputs throughout the network, preventing issues like exploding or vanishing gradients.\n\n- **Normalization Enhancements**: Incorporating both `LayerNorm` and `RMSNorm` within the GAU adds multiple layers of normalization, which stabilize training and improve gradient flow. This dual normalization approach contributes to the model\u2019s robustness and numerical stability.\n\n- **Successful Functionality Checks**: The implementation passed all functionality checks, including unit tests and whole model integration tests. This indicates that the GAU functions correctly within the larger language model, handling forward passes, backward passes, and maintaining causality without issues.\n\n### 3. Areas for Improvement and Specific Suggestions for Refinement or Optimization\n\n#### **A. Further Optimize Attention Computations**\n\nWhile the forward pass has been fully vectorized, there is still potential for optimizing the attention computations to further enhance performance:\n\n- **Efficient Use of `torch.einsum`**: The current implementation utilizes `torch.einsum` for computing tensor contractions, which is flexible but can be inefficient for certain operations. Consider replacing complex `einsum` operations with more optimized tensor operations where possible.\n\n  - **Example**:\n    ```python\n    numerator = Q * S_cumsum  # Currently used\n    # Alternative optimized operation (if applicable)\n    numerator = Q * S_cumsum  # Same as current; ensure it's implemented efficiently\n    ```\n\n- **Leverage Memory-Efficient Operations**: Investigate if alternative tensor operations can be used to reduce memory overhead and improve cache locality, leading to faster computations.\n\n#### **B. Implement Mixed Precision Training**\n\n- **Action**: Utilize PyTorch's Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) to accelerate training and reduce memory usage without significantly sacrificing model performance.\n\n  - **Example**:\n    ```python\n    scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()\n    for data, target in dataloader:\n        optimizer.zero_grad()\n        with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():\n            output, Z = fast_ttt_linear(data)\n            loss = loss_fn(output, target)\n        scaler.scale(loss).backward()\n        scaler.step(optimizer)\n        scaler.update()\n    ```\n\n- **Rationale**: Mixed precision training can lead to substantial speedups and allow for larger batch sizes, further enhancing scalability.\n\n#### **C. Explore Further Normalization Techniques**\n\n- **Action**: While the current implementation uses both `LayerNorm` and `RMSNorm`, consider experimenting with other normalization techniques or fine-tuning existing ones to further stabilize training and improve performance.\n\n  - **Example**:\n    ```python\n    self.custom_norm = SomeOtherNormLayer(...)\n    ```\n\n- **Rationale**: Different normalization methods can have varying impacts on training dynamics. Exploring alternatives may yield performance gains or increased stability.\n\n#### **D. Profiling and Benchmarking**\n\n- **Action**: Conduct thorough profiling using PyTorch\u2019s profiling tools to identify any remaining bottlenecks and validate the efficiency gains achieved through vectorization and other optimizations.\n\n  - **Example**:\n    ```python\n    with torch.profiler.profile(\n        activities=[torch.profiler.ProfilerActivity.CPU, torch.profiler.ProfilerActivity.CUDA],\n        schedule=torch.profiler.schedule(wait=1, warmup=1, active=3, repeat=2),\n        on_trace_ready=torch.profiler.tensorboard_trace_handler('./log'),\n        record_shapes=True,\n        profile_memory=True,\n        with_stack=True\n    ) as prof:\n        for step, (batch, labels) in enumerate(dataloader):\n            Y, Z = fast_ttt_linear(batch)\n            loss = loss_fn(Y, labels)\n            loss.backward()\n            optimizer.step()\n            optimizer.zero_grad()\n            if step >= (5 + 2 * 3) - 1:\n                break\n    print(prof.key_averages().table(sort_by=\"cuda_time_total\", row_limit=10))\n    ```\n\n- **Rationale**: Profiling provides insights into which operations are the most time-consuming, guiding further optimizations to maximize performance.\n\n#### **E. Implement Gradient Clipping**\n\n- **Action**: Introduce gradient clipping during training to prevent gradient explosions, enhancing model stability.\n\n  - **Example**:\n    ```python\n    torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(fast_ttt_linear.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)\n    ```\n\n- **Rationale**: Gradient clipping safeguards against excessively large gradients, which can destabilize training and lead to divergence.\n\n### 4. Comments on Innovation and Potential Impact\n\n**Innovation**:\n\n- **Integration of GLA and RWKV Concepts**: The combination of Gated Linear Attention with RWKV-inspired stateful representations is a pioneering approach.

The use of learnable gates (`gate_proj`) and the hierarchical compression mechanism (`compression_norm` and `compression_layer`) aligns with the intended design.\n\n- **Comprehensive Documentation**: The docstrings provided are detailed and informative, explaining the purpose, key features, arguments, inputs, outputs, examples, and references. This enhances the readability and maintainability of the code.\n\n- **Code Clarity and Structure**: The code is well-organized and follows a clear structure, making it easier to understand the flow of computations within the GAU. The use of descriptive variable names and adherence to coding standards improves code quality.\n\n### Areas for Improvement and Specific Suggestions\n\n1. **Missing Adaptive Rotary Embedding Integration**:\n\n   - **Issue**: The implementation does not include the **adaptive rotary embedding scaling** component, which was a crucial part of the proposal's modifications to the `SwiGluMLP` GAU.\n   - **Suggestion**: Incorporate the `rotary_scale` layer into the GAU. Add the following to the `__init__` method:\n     ```python\n     self.rotary_scale = nn.Linear(self.intermediate_size, self.intermediate_size, bias=False, **self.factory_kwargs)\n     ```\n     And modify the `_forward` method to include:\n     ```python\n     rotary_scaling = torch.sigmoid(self.rotary_scale(compressed))\n     compressed = compressed * rotary_scaling\n     ```\n     This ensures that the positional encoding is adaptively scaled based on the compressed activations, maintaining robustness in dynamic sparse patterns.\n\n2. **Declaration of Child GAUs**:\n\n   - **Issue**: The `CHILDREN_DECLARATIONS` section is missing, and the `RMSNorm` used in `compression_norm` is not declared as a child GAU.\n   - **Suggestion**: Add a `CHILDREN_DECLARATIONS` list at the end of your code to declare `RMSNorm` as a child GAU:\n     ```python\n     CHILDREN_DECLARATIONS = [\n         UnitDecl(\n             unitname=\"RMSNorm\",\n             requirements=\"Applies root mean square layer normalization.\",\n             inputs=[\"X\"],\n             outputs=[\"Y\"]\n         ),\n     ]\n     ```\n     This enhances modularity and ensures proper integration within the hierarchical GAU structure.\n\n3. **Missing Unit Tests**:\n\n   - **Issue**: No unit tests are provided for the `SwiGluMLP` GAU, which are essential for verifying functionality and correctness.\n   - **Suggestion**: Implement a unit test function following the template:\n     ```python\n     @gau_test\n     def test_swiglu_mlp(device=None, dtype=None) -> None:\n         embed_dim = 128\n         batch_size = 2\n         seq_len = 16\n         X = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim, device=device, dtype=dtype)\n         swiglu_mlp = SwiGluMLP(embed_dim=embed_dim, block_loc=(0, 0), kwarg_all={}, device=device, dtype=dtype)\n         Y, Z = swiglu_mlp(X)\n         assert Y.shape == X.shape, f\"Expected output shape {X.shape}, got {Y.shape}\"\n     ```\n     This test checks that the output shape matches the input shape and that the GAU runs without errors.\n\n4. **Summary of Changes**:\n\n   - **Issue**: The implementation lacks a summary of changes made by the coder.\n   - **Suggestion**: Provide a brief summary outlining how the `SwiGluMLP` was modified according to the proposal, highlighting the integration of dynamic sparse activation, hierarchical compression, and (after inclusion) adaptive rotary embeddings.\n\n5. **Consistent Use of Factory Keyword Arguments**:\n\n   - **Issue**: In some places, `**kwarg_all` is used redundantly when `self.factory_kwargs` already contains the required device and dtype.\n   - **Suggestion**: Review the initialization of layers to ensure that `self.factory_kwargs` is used consistently without unnecessary duplication, for example:\n     ```python\n     self.compression_norm = RMSNorm(\n         embed_dim=self.intermediate_size,\n         block_loc=block_loc,\n         kwarg_all=kwarg_all,\n         **self.factory_kwargs\n     )\n     ```\n\n### Comments on Innovation and Potential Impact\n\n- **Enhanced Efficiency and Expressiveness**: The integration of dynamic sparse activation and hierarchical compression has the potential to improve computational efficiency by reducing unnecessary computations and capturing multi-scale dependencies. This can lead to faster training and inference times, especially for long sequences.\n\n- **Scalability**: By efficiently managing computational resources, the modified `SwiGluMLP` can contribute to better scalability of the language model, allowing it to handle larger datasets and more complex tasks without a proportional increase in computational cost.\n\n- **Integration with Existing GAUs**: Once the adaptive rotary embedding scaling is included, the GAU will align more closely with the proposal, ensuring compatibility and synergy with other components of the model that utilize positional encodings.\n\n### Recommendations for the Coder\n\n1. **Include Adaptive Rotary Embedding Scaling**: Integrate the adaptive rotary embedding scaling as outlined in the proposal to complete the implementation and fully realize the intended enhancements.\n\n2. **Declare Child GAUs**: Add the necessary `CHILDREN_DECLARATIONS` to declare `RMSNorm` and any other GAUs used within `SwiGluMLP`. This practice ensures modularity and clarity in the model's hierarchical structure.\n\n3. **Implement Unit Tests**: Write comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of `SwiGluMLP`. Tests should cover various input shapes, data types, and edge cases to ensure robustness.\n\n4. **Provide a Summary of Changes**: Document the modifications made to `SwiGluMLP`, highlighting how they address the objectives outlined in the proposal. This aids in understanding the implementation and its alignment with the design plan.\n\n5. **Review and Optimize Code**: Perform a thorough review of the code to identify any redundant or unnecessary components. Ensure that all layers and operations are essential and contribute to the GAU's functionality.\n\n6. **Prepare for Integration**: Consider how `SwiGluMLP` will integrate with the larger model, including potential interactions with other GAUs and the overall data flow. Ensure that the interfaces and data formats are consistent.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Testing with Real Data**: After implementing the unit tests, evaluate the GAU using real or synthetic data representative of actual use cases. Analyze performance metrics to assess improvements in efficiency and expressiveness.\n\n- **Performance Profiling**: Profile the GAU to identify any bottlenecks or areas where computational efficiency can be further enhanced. This may involve optimizing certain operations or utilizing more efficient implementations.\n\n- **Documentation Updates**: Update the docstrings and comments to reflect any additional changes made during refinement. Ensure that all explanations are accurate and helpful for future developers and reviewers.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the implementation of `SwiGluMLP` will be more robust, fully aligned with the proposal, and better prepared for integration into the larger language model. This will contribute to achieving the team's goals of improved performance, efficiency, and scalability in the novel autoregressive language model.",

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.",

Areas for Improvement and Specific Suggestions for Refinement or Optimization\n\n#### **A. Further Optimize Attention Computations**\n\nWhile the forward pass has been fully vectorized, there is still potential for optimizing the attention computations to further enhance performance:\n\n- **Efficient Use of `torch.einsum`**: The current implementation utilizes `torch.einsum` for computing tensor contractions, which is flexible but can be inefficient for certain operations. Consider replacing complex `einsum` operations with more optimized tensor operations where possible.\n\n  - **Example**:\n    ```python\n    numerator = Q * S_cumsum  # Currently used\n    # Alternative optimized operation (if applicable)\n    numerator = Q * S_cumsum  # Same as current; ensure it's implemented efficiently\n    ```\n\n- **Leverage Memory-Efficient Operations**: Investigate if alternative tensor operations can be used to reduce memory overhead and improve cache locality, leading to faster computations.\n\n#### **B. Implement Mixed Precision Training**\n\n- **Action**: Utilize PyTorch's Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) to accelerate training and reduce memory usage without significantly sacrificing model performance.\n\n  - **Example**:\n    ```python\n    scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()\n    for data, target in dataloader:\n        optimizer.zero_grad()\n        with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():\n            output, Z = fast_ttt_linear(data)\n            loss = loss_fn(output, target)\n        scaler.scale(loss).backward()\n        scaler.step(optimizer)\n        scaler.update()\n    ```\n\n- **Rationale**: Mixed precision training can lead to substantial speedups and allow for larger batch sizes, further enhancing scalability.\n\n#### **C. Explore Further Normalization Techniques**\n\n- **Action**: While the current implementation uses both `LayerNorm` and `RMSNorm`, consider experimenting with other normalization techniques or fine-tuning existing ones to further stabilize training and improve performance.\n\n  - **Example**:\n    ```python\n    self.custom_norm = SomeOtherNormLayer(...)\n    ```\n\n- **Rationale**: Different normalization methods can have varying impacts on training dynamics. Exploring alternatives may yield performance gains or increased stability.\n\n#### **D. Profiling and Benchmarking**\n\n- **Action**: Conduct thorough profiling using PyTorch\u2019s profiling tools to identify any remaining bottlenecks and validate the efficiency gains achieved through vectorization and other optimizations.\n\n  - **Example**:\n    ```python\n    with torch.profiler.profile(\n        activities=[torch.profiler.ProfilerActivity.CPU, torch.profiler.ProfilerActivity.CUDA],\n        schedule=torch.profiler.schedule(wait=1, warmup=1, active=3, repeat=2),\n        on_trace_ready=torch.profiler.tensorboard_trace_handler('./log'),\n        record_shapes=True,\n        profile_memory=True,\n        with_stack=True\n    ) as prof:\n        for step, (batch, labels) in enumerate(dataloader):\n            Y, Z = fast_ttt_linear(batch)\n            loss = loss_fn(Y, labels)\n            loss.backward()\n            optimizer.step()\n            optimizer.zero_grad()\n            if step >= (5 + 2 * 3) - 1:\n                break\n    print(prof.key_averages().table(sort_by=\"cuda_time_total\", row_limit=10))\n    ```\n\n- **Rationale**: Profiling provides insights into which operations are the most time-consuming, guiding further optimizations to maximize performance.\n\n#### **E. Implement Gradient Clipping**\n\n- **Action**: Introduce gradient clipping during training to prevent gradient explosions, enhancing model stability.\n\n  - **Example**:\n    ```python\n    torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(fast_ttt_linear.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)\n    ```\n\n- **Rationale**: Gradient clipping safeguards against excessively large gradients, which can destabilize training and lead to divergence.\n\n### 4.

                        "review": "```rating 3.5```\n\n### Strengths of the Implementation\n\n- **Alignment with Proposal Objectives**: The implementation successfully integrates **dynamic sparse activation** and **hierarchical compression** into the `SwiGluMLP` GAU, as outlined in the proposal. The use of learnable gates (`gate_proj`) and the hierarchical compression mechanism (`compression_norm` and `compression_layer`) aligns with the intended design.\n\n- **Comprehensive Documentation**: The docstrings provided are detailed and informative, explaining the purpose, key features, arguments, inputs, outputs, examples, and references. This enhances the readability and maintainability of the code.\n\n- **Code Clarity and Structure**: The code is well-organized and follows a clear structure, making it easier to understand the flow of computations within the GAU. The use of descriptive variable names and adherence to coding standards improves code quality.\n\n### Areas for Improvement and Specific Suggestions\n\n1. **Missing Adaptive Rotary Embedding Integration**:\n\n   - **Issue**: The implementation does not include the **adaptive rotary embedding scaling** component, which was a crucial part of the proposal's modifications to the `SwiGluMLP` GAU.\n   - **Suggestion**: Incorporate the `rotary_scale` layer into the GAU. Add the following to the `__init__` method:\n     ```python\n     self.rotary_scale = nn.Linear(self.intermediate_size, self.intermediate_size, bias=False, **self.factory_kwargs)\n     ```\n     And modify the `_forward` method to include:\n     ```python\n     rotary_scaling = torch.sigmoid(self.rotary_scale(compressed))\n     compressed = compressed * rotary_scaling\n     ```\n     This ensures that the positional encoding is adaptively scaled based on the compressed activations, maintaining robustness in dynamic sparse patterns.\n\n2. **Declaration of Child GAUs**:\n\n   - **Issue**: The `CHILDREN_DECLARATIONS` section is missing, and the `RMSNorm` used in `compression_norm` is not declared as a child GAU.\n   - **Suggestion**: Add a `CHILDREN_DECLARATIONS` list at the end of your code to declare `RMSNorm` as a child GAU:\n     ```python\n     CHILDREN_DECLARATIONS = [\n         UnitDecl(\n             unitname=\"RMSNorm\",\n             requirements=\"Applies root mean square layer normalization.\",\n             inputs=[\"X\"],\n             outputs=[\"Y\"]\n         ),\n     ]\n     ```\n     This enhances modularity and ensures proper integration within the hierarchical GAU structure.\n\n3. **Missing Unit Tests**:\n\n   - **Issue**: No unit tests are provided for the `SwiGluMLP` GAU, which are essential for verifying functionality and correctness.\n   - **Suggestion**: Implement a unit test function following the template:\n     ```python\n     @gau_test\n     def test_swiglu_mlp(device=None, dtype=None) -> None:\n         embed_dim = 128\n         batch_size = 2\n         seq_len = 16\n         X = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim, device=device, dtype=dtype)\n         swiglu_mlp = SwiGluMLP(embed_dim=embed_dim, block_loc=(0, 0), kwarg_all={}, device=device, dtype=dtype)\n         Y, Z = swiglu_mlp(X)\n         assert Y.shape == X.shape, f\"Expected output shape {X.shape}, got {Y.shape}\"\n     ```\n     This test checks that the output shape matches the input shape and that the GAU runs without errors.\n\n4. **Summary of Changes**:\n\n   - **Issue**: The implementation lacks a summary of changes made by the coder.\n   - **Suggestion**: Provide a brief summary outlining how the `SwiGluMLP` was modified according to the proposal, highlighting the integration of dynamic sparse activation, hierarchical compression, and (after inclusion) adaptive rotary embeddings.\n\n5. **Consistent Use of Factory Keyword Arguments**:\n\n   - **Issue**: In some places, `**kwarg_all` is used redundantly when `self.factory_kwargs` already contains the required device and dtype.\n   - **Suggestion**: Review the initialization of layers to ensure that `self.factory_kwargs` is used consistently without unnecessary duplication, for example:\n     ```python\n     self.compression_norm = RMSNorm(\n         embed_dim=self.intermediate_size,\n         block_loc=block_loc,\n         kwarg_all=kwarg_all,\n         **self.factory_kwargs\n     )\n     ```\n\n### Comments on Innovation and Potential Impact\n\n- **Enhanced Efficiency and Expressiveness**: The integration of dynamic sparse activation and hierarchical compression has the potential to improve computational efficiency by reducing unnecessary computations and capturing multi-scale dependencies. This can lead to faster training and inference times, especially for long sequences.\n\n- **Scalability**: By efficiently managing computational resources, the modified `SwiGluMLP` can contribute to better scalability of the language model, allowing it to handle larger datasets and more complex tasks without a proportional increase in computational cost.\n\n- **Integration with Existing GAUs**: Once the adaptive rotary embedding scaling is included, the GAU will align more closely with the proposal, ensuring compatibility and synergy with other components of the model that utilize positional encodings.\n\n### Recommendations for the Coder\n\n1. **Include Adaptive Rotary Embedding Scaling**: Integrate the adaptive rotary embedding scaling as outlined in the proposal to complete the implementation and fully realize the intended enhancements.\n\n2. **Declare Child GAUs**: Add the necessary `CHILDREN_DECLARATIONS` to declare `RMSNorm` and any other GAUs used within `SwiGluMLP`. This practice ensures modularity and clarity in the model's hierarchical structure.\n\n3. **Implement Unit Tests**: Write comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of `SwiGluMLP`. Tests should cover various input shapes, data types, and edge cases to ensure robustness.\n\n4. **Provide a Summary of Changes**: Document the modifications made to `SwiGluMLP`, highlighting how they address the objectives outlined in the proposal. This aids in understanding the implementation and its alignment with the design plan.\n\n5. **Review and Optimize Code**: Perform a thorough review of the code to identify any redundant or unnecessary components. Ensure that all layers and operations are essential and contribute to the GAU's functionality.\n\n6. **Prepare for Integration**: Consider how `SwiGluMLP` will integrate with the larger model, including potential interactions with other GAUs and the overall data flow. Ensure that the interfaces and data formats are consistent.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Testing with Real Data**: After implementing the unit tests, evaluate the GAU using real or synthetic data representative of actual use cases. Analyze performance metrics to assess improvements in efficiency and expressiveness.\n\n- **Performance Profiling**: Profile the GAU to identify any bottlenecks or areas where computational efficiency can be further enhanced. This may involve optimizing certain operations or utilizing more efficient implementations.\n\n- **Documentation Updates**: Update the docstrings and comments to reflect any additional changes made during refinement. Ensure that all explanations are accurate and helpful for future developers and reviewers.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the implementation of `SwiGluMLP` will be more robust, fully aligned with the proposal, and better prepared for integration into the larger language model. This will contribute to achieving the team's goals of improved performance, efficiency, and scalability in the novel autoregressive language model.",
