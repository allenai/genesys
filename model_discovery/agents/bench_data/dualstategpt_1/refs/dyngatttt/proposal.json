In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/27 (Score: 0.66)*\n\n```\n(7)). ${ }^{7}$\n\nRMSNorm vs. LayerNorm Results show that replacing RMSNorm with LayerNorm $($ (7) $\\rightarrow$ (8) leads to no quality improvement ( -0.13 tokenized BLEU).

Their success hinges on the fact that the underlying physical phenomena are continuous. For inherently discrete and categorical data such as language, various diffusion-inspired alternatives have been proposed. However, the continuous nature of diffusion models conveys many benefits, and in this work we endeavour to preserve it. We propose CDCD, a framework for modelling categorical data with diffusion models that are continuous both in time and input space. We demonstrate its efficacy on several language modelling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 72/76 (Score: 0.42)*\n\n```\nWei, and Z. Sui.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/27 (Score: 0.32)*\n\n```\nHinton. 2016.

SLAB: Efficient Transformers with Simplified Linear Attention and Progressive Re-parameterized Batch Normalization (Avg. Score: 0.25)\n\n*Jialong Guo, Xinghao Chen, Yehui Tang, Yunhe Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel method named PRepBN is proposed to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training and a simplified linear attention (SLA) module is proposed that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have become foundational architectures for both natural language and computer vision tasks. However, the high computational cost makes it quite challenging to deploy on resource-constraint devices. This paper investigates the computational bottleneck modules of efficient transformer, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. LayerNorm is commonly used in transformer architectures but is not computational friendly due to statistic calculation during inference. However, replacing LayerNorm with more efficient BatchNorm in transformer often leads to inferior performance and collapse in training. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named PRepBN to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training. Moreover, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments on image classification as well as object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, our SLAB-Swin obtains $83.6\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with $16.2$ms latency, which is $2.4$ms less than that of Flatten-Swin with $0.1\\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower latency.Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/xinghaochen/SLAB and https://github.com/mindspore-lab/models/tree/master/research/huawei-noah/SLAB.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/25 (Score: 0.25)*\n\n```\n2}$ | $\\mathbf{8 3 . 6}$ |\n\n### 5.4. Ablation Studies\n\nIn this section, we conduct extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of our key designs. The impact of SLA and PRepBN. We first explore the impact of the simplified linear attention (SLA) module and progressive re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN) on different backbones. As shown in Table 6, utilizing our simplified linear attention (SLA) brings consistent improvement for efficiency. For DeiT and PVT, our SLA obtains significant latency reduction and a few accuracy drop. Moreover, Swin transformers equipped with our SLA achieve quite comparable accuracy with that of original ones but with lower latency. In addition, the latency could be further reduced by replacing LayerNorm by our proposed progressive re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN). This strategy hardly affects the accuracy and even recover the accuracy of model like DeiT and PVT. Combining these two strategies, the latency is reduced by 5.6 ms when the accuracy is improved by $0.2 \\%$ for DeiT-T. Moreover, our method obtains similar accuracy and harvests 2.2 ms and 2.4 ms latency reduction for Swin-T and Swin-S models. Ablation study for PRepBN. We investigate key components of our proposed PRepBN, i.e., the progressive strategy and re-parameterized BatchNorm (RepBN). Directly train-\nTable 7.

To avoid the variance shift (Li et al., 2019) caused by droppath, which will influence the performance of BatchNorm, we simply set the droppath rate to 0 on DeiT-T model. As shown in Table 7, applying progressive strategy on a BatchNorm-based DeiTT model brings $1.2 \\%$ accuracy gain. We further utilize our RepBN in the model and the accuracy increases to $73.6 \\%$. These results demonstrate that both our proposed progressive strategy and re-parameterized BatchNorm (RepBN) are beneficial for training a pure BatchNorm-based transformer. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we investigates the computational bottleneck modules of transformer and propose novel strategies including progressive Re-parameterized BatchNorm and simplified linear attention to obtain efficient transformer architectures. Our method progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm during training to obtain lossless accuracy, while leveraging the efficiency advantages of BatchNorm during inference. Additionally, we devise a simplified linear attention mechanism that attains comparable performance with other linear attention methods but with less computational cost. Through extensive experiments for both computer vision and language modeling tasks, we showcase that our method achieves stronger performance with respect to accuracy and efficiency than prior methods and sheds light into the design of efficient transformer.

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/28 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nSo, and Quoc V.

Different from the conventional KV cache that retains key and value vectors for all context tokens, we conduct targeted profiling to discern the intrinsic structure of attention modules. Based on the recognized structure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding non-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only employing the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all tokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the construction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without resource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across various asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss.

Pre-RMSNorm and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformers: Equivalent and Efficient Pre-LN Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive RMSNorm*\n\n*Zixuan Jiang, Jiaqi Gu, Hanqing Zhu, D. Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference is formally established, implying that Pre- LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved great success in machine learning applications. Normalization techniques, such as Layer Normalization (LayerNorm, LN) and Root Mean Square Normalization (RMSNorm), play a critical role in accelerating and stabilizing the training of Transformers. While LayerNorm recenters and rescales input vectors, RMSNorm only rescales the vectors by their RMS value. Despite being more computationally efficient, RMSNorm may compromise the representation ability of Transformers. There is currently no consensus regarding the preferred normalization technique, as some models employ LayerNorm while others utilize RMSNorm, especially in recent large language models. It is challenging to convert Transformers with one normalization to the other type. While there is an ongoing disagreement between the two normalization types, we propose a solution to unify two mainstream Transformer architectures, Pre-LN and Pre-RMSNorm Transformers. By removing the inherent redundant mean information in the main branch of Pre-LN Transformers, we can reduce LayerNorm to RMSNorm, achieving higher efficiency. We further propose the Compressed RMSNorm (CRMSNorm) and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer based on a lossless compression of the zero-mean vectors. We formally establish the equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference. It implies that Pre-LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSNorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement. Experiments demonstrate that we can reduce the training and inference time of Pre-LN Transformers by 1% - 10%.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Dynamic Normalization and Relay for Video Action Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic normalization*\n\n*Dongqi Cai, Anbang Yao, Yurong Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Dynamic Normalization and Relay (DNR), an improved normalization design, is presented, to augment the spatial-temporal representation learning of any deep action recognition model, adapting to small batch size training settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been the dominant model for video action recognition. Due to the huge memory and compute demand, popular action recognition networks need to be trained with small batch sizes, which makes learning discriminative spatial-temporal representations for videos become a challenging problem. In this paper, we present Dynamic Normalization and Relay (DNR), an improved normalization design, to augment the spatial-temporal representation learning of any deep action recognition model, adapting to small batch size training settings. We observe that state-of-the-art action recognition networks usually apply the same normalization parameters to all video data, and ignore the dependencies of the estimated normalization parameters between neighboring frames (at the same layer) and between neighboring layers (with all frames of a video clip). Inspired by this, DNR introduces two dynamic normalization relay modules to explore the potentials of cross-temporal and cross-layer feature distribution dependencies for estimating accurate layer-wise normalization parameters. These two DNR modules are instantiated as a light-weight recurrent structure conditioned on the current input features, and the normalization parameters estimated from the neighboring frames based features at the same layer or from the whole video clip based features at the preceding layers. We \ufb01rst plug DNR into prevailing 2D CNN backbones and test its performance on public action recognition datasets including Kinetics and Something-Something. Experimental results show that DNR brings large performance improvements to the baselines, achieving over 4.4 % absolute margins in top-1 accuracy without training bells and whistles. More experiments on 3D backbones and several latest 2D spatial-temporal networks further validate its effectiveness.

Reducing Fine-Tuning Memory Overhead by Approximate and Memory-Sharing Backpropagation\n\n*From Search Query: layer normalization alternatives*\n\n*Yuchen Yang, Yingdong Shi, Cheems Wang, Xiantong Zhen, Yuxuan Shi, Jun Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Approximate Backpropagation (Approx-BP) theory is proposed, which provides the theoretical feasibility of decoupling the forward and backward passes of backpropagation training, and a Memory-Sharing Backpropagation strategy, which enables the activation memory to be shared by two adjacent layers, thereby removing activation memory usage redundancy.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning pretrained large models to downstream tasks is an important problem, which however suffers from huge memory overhead due to large-scale parameters. This work strives to reduce memory overhead in fine-tuning from perspectives of activation function and layer normalization. To this end, we propose the Approximate Backpropagation (Approx-BP) theory, which provides the theoretical feasibility of decoupling the forward and backward passes. We apply our Approx-BP theory to backpropagation training and derive memory-efficient alternatives of GELU and SiLU activation functions, which use derivative functions of ReLUs in the backward pass while keeping their forward pass unchanged. In addition, we introduce a Memory-Sharing Backpropagation strategy, which enables the activation memory to be shared by two adjacent layers, thereby removing activation memory usage redundancy.

Exploring the Impact of Layer Normalization for Zero-shot Neural Machine Translation\n\n*From Search Query: layer normalization alternatives*\n\n*Zhuoyuan Mao, Raj Dabre, Qianying Liu, Haiyue Song, Chenhui Chu, S. Kurohashi*\n\n**TL;DR:** The original Transformer setting of LayerNorm after residual connections (PostNorm) consistently outperforms PreNorm by up to 12.3 BLEU points and highlights the need for careful consideration of the LayerNorm setting for ZST.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper studies the impact of layer normalization (LayerNorm) on zero-shot translation (ZST). Recent efforts for ZST often utilize the Transformer architecture as the backbone, with LayerNorm at the input of layers (PreNorm) set as the default. However, Xu et al. (2019) has revealed that PreNorm carries the risk of overfitting the training data. Based on this, we hypothesize that PreNorm may overfit supervised directions and thus have low generalizability for ZST. Through experiments on OPUS, IWSLT, and Europarl datasets for 54 ZST directions, we demonstrate that the original Transformer setting of LayerNorm after residual connections (PostNorm) consistently outperforms PreNorm by up to 12.3 BLEU points. We then study the performance disparities by analyzing the differences in off-target rates and structural variations between PreNorm and PostNorm. This study highlights the need for careful consideration of the LayerNorm setting for ZST.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. On Layer Normalization in the Transformer Architecture\n\n*From Search Query: layer normalization alternatives*\n\n*Ruibin Xiong, Yunchang Yang, Di He, Kai Zheng, Shuxin Zheng, Chen Xing, Huishuai Zhang, Yanyan Lan, Liwei Wang, Tie-Yan Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved with mean field theory that at initialization, for the original-designed Post-LN Transformer, which places the layer normalization between the residual blocks, the expected gradients of the parameters near the output layer are large and using a large learning rate makes the training unstable.\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer is widely used in natural language processing tasks. To train a Transformer however, one usually needs a carefully designed learning rate warm-up stage, which is shown to be crucial to the final performance but will slow down the optimization and bring more hyperparameter tunings. In this paper, we first study theoretically why the learning rate warm-up stage is essential and show that the location of layer normalization matters. Specifically, we prove with mean field theory that at initialization, for the original-designed Post-LN Transformer, which places the layer normalization between the residual blocks, the expected gradients of the parameters near the output layer are large. Therefore, using a large learning rate on those gradients makes the training unstable. The warm-up stage is practically helpful for avoiding this problem. On the other hand, our theory also shows that if the layer normalization is put inside the residual blocks (recently proposed as Pre-LN Transformer), the gradients are well-behaved at initialization. This motivates us to remove the warm-up stage for the training of Pre-LN Transformers. We show in our experiments that Pre-LN Transformers without the warm-up stage can reach comparable results with baselines while requiring significantly less training time and hyper-parameter tuning on a wide range of applications.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 787  (*Influential: 48*)\n\n### 1 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Root Mean Square Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive RMSNorm*\n\n*Rico Sennrich, Biao Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) has been successfully applied to various deep neural networks to help stabilize training and boost model convergence because of its capability in handling re-centering and re-scaling of both inputs and weight matrix. However, the computational overhead introduced by LayerNorm makes these improvements expensive and significantly slows the underlying network, e.g. RNN in particular. In this paper, we hypothesize that re-centering invariance in LayerNorm is dispensable and propose root mean square layer normalization, or RMSNorm. RMSNorm regularizes the summed inputs to a neuron in one layer according to root mean square (RMS), giving the model re-scaling invariance property and implicit learning rate adaptation ability. RMSNorm is computationally simpler and thus more efficient than LayerNorm. We also present partial RMSNorm, or pRMSNorm where the RMS is estimated from p% of the summed inputs without breaking the above properties. Extensive experiments on several tasks using diverse network architectures show that RMSNorm achieves comparable performance against LayerNorm but reduces the running time by 7%~64% on different models.

Modeling Continuous Stochastic Processes with Dynamic Normalizing Flows\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic normalization*\n\n*Andreas Lehrmann, Greg Mori, Bo Chang, Ruizhi Deng, Marcus A. Brubaker*\n\n**Abstract:** Normalizing flows transform a simple base distribution into a complex target distribution and have proved to be powerful models for data generation and density estimation. In this work, we propose a novel type of normalizing flow driven by a differential deformation of the Wiener process. As a result, we obtain a rich time series model whose observable process inherits many of the appealing properties of its base process, such as efficient computation of likelihoods and marginals. Furthermore, our continuous treatment provides a natural framework for irregular time series with an independent arrival process, including straightforward interpolation. We illustrate the desirable properties of the proposed model on popular stochastic processes and demonstrate its superior flexibility to variational RNN and latent ODE baselines in a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world data.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-24\n\n\n\n#### 3. Dynamic Token Normalization Improves Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic normalization*\n\n*Ping Luo, Ying Shan, Xiaogang Wang, Xuyuan Xu, Zhaoyang Zhang, Yixiao Ge, Wenqi Shao*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants (e.g., Swin, PVT) have achieved great success in various computer vision tasks, owing to their capability to learn long-range contextual information. Layer Normalization (LN) is an essential ingredient in these models. However, we found that the ordinary LN makes tokens at different positions similar in magnitude because it normalizes embeddings within each token. It is difficult for Transformers to capture inductive bias such as the positional context in an image with LN. We tackle this problem by proposing a new normalizer, termed Dynamic Token Normalization (DTN), where normalization is performed both within each token (intra-token) and across different tokens (inter-token). DTN has several merits. Firstly, it is built on a unified formulation and thus can represent various existing normalization methods. Secondly, DTN learns to normalize tokens in both intra-token and inter-token manners, enabling Transformers to capture both the global contextual information and the local positional context. {Thirdly, by simply replacing LN layers, DTN can be readily plugged into various vision transformers, such as ViT, Swin, PVT, LeViT, T2T-ViT, BigBird and Reformer. Extensive experiments show that the transformer equipped with DTN consistently outperforms baseline model with minimal extra parameters and computational overhead. For example, DTN outperforms LN by $0.5\\%$ - $1.2\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, by $1.2$ - $1.4$ box AP in object detection on COCO benchmark, by $2.3\\%$ - $3.9\\%$ mCE in robustness experiments on ImageNet-C, and by $0.5\\%$ - $0.8\\%$ accuracy in Long ListOps on Long-Range Arena.} Codes will be made public at \\url{https://github.com/wqshao126/DTN}\n\n**Conference:** dynamic-token-normalization-improves-vision\n\n**Published:** 2021-12-05\n\n\n\n#### 4. DeepNet: Scaling Transformers to 1,000 Layers\n\n*From Search Query: layer normalization alternatives*\n\n*Furu Wei, Dongdong Zhang, Shaohan Huang, Li Dong, Shuming Ma, Hongyu Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to stabilize extremely deep Transformers. Specifically, we introduce a new normalization function (DeepNorm) to modify the residual connection in Transformer, accompanying with theoretically derived initialization. In-depth theoretical analysis shows that model updates can be bounded in a stable way. The proposed method combines the best of two worlds, i.e., good performance of Post-LN and stable training of Pre-LN, making DeepNorm a preferred alternative. We successfully scale Transformers up to 1,000 layers (i.e., 2,500 attention and feed-forward network sublayers) without difficulty, which is one order of magnitude deeper than previous deep Transformers. Remarkably, on a multilingual benchmark with 7,482 translation directions, our 200-layer model with 3.2B parameters significantly outperforms the 48-layer state-of-the-art model with 12B parameters by 5 BLEU points, which indicates a promising scaling direction.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-01\n\n\n\n#### 5. Dual PatchNorm\n\n*From Search Query: layer normalization alternatives*\n\n*Neil Houlsby, Mostafa Dehghani, Manoj Kumar*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Dual PatchNorm: two Layer Normalization layers (LayerNorms), before and after the patch embedding layer in Vision Transformers. We demonstrate that Dual PatchNorm outperforms the result of exhaustive search for alternative LayerNorm placement strategies in the Transformer block itself. In our experiments, incorporating this trivial modification, often leads to improved accuracy over well-tuned Vision Transformers and never hurts.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-02\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher in designing a novel Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) block with enhanced normalization techniques, here are the key insights and useful information gathered from the provided sources:\n\n### Adaptive and Dynamic Normalization Techniques\n\n- **Adaptive RMSNorm**:\n  - This technique involves making the normalization process adaptable rather than static. For instance, the \"Liquid-Metal-Tinyllama-Test-1\" model uses an adaptive RMSNorm that normalizes the input while applying an adaptive scaling based on the global context of each input batch. This approach improves the model's ability to generalize across diverse inputs and enhances training stability.\n\n- **Context-Aware Scaling**:\n  - Dynamic normalization can adjust scaling parameters based on the contextual information of the input sequence. This is similar to the concept of pre-normalization, where layer normalization is applied before the self-attention and feed-forward layers, which has been shown to improve model convergence and performance.\n\n- **Learnable Scaling Factors**:\n  - Incorporating learnable parameters that adapt during training can optimize normalization based on task-specific requirements. This approach is hinted at in the use of RMSNorm in the Bielik 7B v0.1 model, which offers improved training stability and faster computation compared to traditional Layer Normalization.\n\n### Implementation and Integration\n\n- **Token Mixing and SEBlock**:\n  - Techniques like Token Mixing, which blends information across tokens within each feature channel, and SEBlock (Squeeze-and-Excitation Block), which performs adaptive channel-wise recalibration, can complement adaptive normalization. These components help capture local dependencies and dynamically adjust feature importance, respectively, enhancing the model's overall performance.\n\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**:\n  - To maintain efficiency, the implementation of adaptive normalization should be optimized for hardware acceleration. For example, the use of asynchronous parallel linear operations and sharding techniques can improve device efficiency and reduce training time, as seen in the ViT-22B model.\n\n### Training Stability and Optimization\n\n- **Normalization Before Attention**:\n  - Applying normalization before the self-attention and feed-forward layers can stabilize training and improve convergence. This is a common practice in many transformer models, including the Bielik 7B v0.1 model, which uses pre-normalization to enhance model performance.\n\n- **Adaptive Learning Rate**:\n  - Implementing an adaptive learning rate, such as the one used in the Bielik 7B v0.1 model, can help ensure consistent influence from each instruction and stabilize training, especially when dealing with varying sequence lengths.\n\n### Key References\n\n- **Bielik 7B v0.1 Model**:\n  - This model incorporates RMSNorm for improved training stability and faster computation. It also uses pre-normalization and adaptive learning rates, which are relevant to the researcher's goals.\n\n- **Liquid-Metal-Tinyllama-Test-1 Model**:\n  - This model implements adaptive RMSNorm, Token Mixing, and SEBlock, providing insights into how these components can enhance model performance and adaptability.\n\n- **Transformer Architecture Variations**:\n  - The discussion on advanced transformer architectures, such as the ViT-22B model, highlights the importance of parallel processing, efficient resource management, and innovative training techniques, which are crucial for scaling and optimizing GAUs.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n- **Recent Advancements in Adaptive Normalization**:\n  - Search for recent papers and implementations that focus on adaptive and dynamic normalization techniques in deep learning models.\n\n- **Implementation Strategies and Frameworks**:\n  - Investigate existing frameworks or libraries that support dynamic normalization mechanisms to facilitate seamless integration into GAUs.\n\n- **Performance Benchmarks and Case Studies**:\n  - Look for benchmarks and performance analyses of adaptive RMSNorm in language models to assess potential improvements and identify best practices for implementation.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can develop a novel GAU block that leverages adaptive and dynamic normalization techniques to enhance language model performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

We introduce Megalodon, a neural architecture for efficient sequence modeling with unlimited context length. Megalodon inherits the architecture of Mega (exponential moving average with gated attention), and further introduces multiple technical components to improve its capability and stability, including complex exponential moving average (CEMA), timestep normalization layer, normalized attention mechanism and pre-norm with two-hop residual configuration. In a controlled head-to-head comparison with Llama2, Megalodon achieves better efficiency than Transformer in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens.

For classification task, we replace the timestep normalization with the standard group normalization method. Top-1 accuracy on the validation set is reported in Table 4 to assess various models. MEGALODON obtains about $1.3 \\%$ accuracy improvement over DeiT-B (Touvron et al., 2021), and 0.8\\%. improvement over MEGA (Ma et al., 2023). Auto-regressive Language Modeling on PG-19 We also evaluate MEgALODON on auto-regressive language modeling on the medium-scale PG19 (Rae et al., 2019) datasets. We use the same vocabulary from Block-Recurrent Transformer (Hutchins et al., 2022) and adopt most of its hyper-parameters to train a MEgAlodon model with 1.3B parameters. Table 5 illustrate the word-level perplexity (PPL) of MEGALODON on PG-19, together with previous state-of-the-art models, including Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020), Perceiver AR (Hawthorne et al., 2022), Block-Recurrent Transformer (Hutchins et al., 2022) and MEGAB yte (Yu et al., 2024). MEgAlODON significantly outperforms all the baselines. ## 5 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced MEgALODON, an improved MEGA architecture with multiple novel technical components, including complex exponential moving average (CEMA), the timestep normalization layer, normalized attention and pre-norm with two-hop residual configuration, to improve its capability, efficiency and scalability. Through a direct comparison with Llama2, MEGAlODON achieves impressive improvements on both training perplexity and across downstream benchmarks. Importantly, experimental results on long-context modeling demonstrate MEGALODON's ability to model sequences of unlimited length. Additional experiments on small/medium-scale benchmarks across different data modalities illustrate the robust improvements of MEGALODON, which lead to a potential direction of future work to apply MEGALODON for large-scale multi-modality pretraining. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Sadhika Malladi, Zihao Ye, Dacheng Li and Rulin Shao for their helpful feedback and discussion during this work. ## References\n\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/27 (Score: 0.27)*\n\n```\n(7)). ${ }^{7}$\n\nRMSNorm vs. LayerNorm Results show that replacing RMSNorm with LayerNorm $($ (7) $\\rightarrow$ (8) leads to no quality improvement ( -0.13 tokenized BLEU).

TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanisms, tensor normalization, and inference acceleration and stabilization. Specifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique that accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces memory usage by a remarkable four times. To further enhance the performance of TransNormer, we leverage a gating mechanism for smooth training and a new tensor normalization scheme to accelerate the model, resulting in an impressive acceleration of over $20\\%$. Furthermore, we develop a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length, showcasing superior efficiency during both training and inference stages. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models, i.e., LLMs with 175B parameters. We validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of 385M, 1B, and 7B on our self-collected corpus. Benchmark results demonstrate that our models not only match the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs with Transformer but are also significantly faster.

State Space Model State Space Model is based on the State Space Equation for sequence modeling (Gu et al. 2022b), using special initialization (Gu et al., 2020, 2022a), diagonalization assumptions (Gupta et al., 2022), and some techniques (Dao et al., 2022b) to achieve performance comparable to Transformers. On the other hand, due to the characteristics of the State Space Equation, it enables inference to be conducted within constant complexity (Gu et al., 2022b). Long Convolution Long convolution models ( Qin et al. 2023, Fu et al. 2023) utilize a kernel size equal to the input sequence length, facilitating a wider context compared to traditional convolutions. Training these models involves the efficient $O(n \\log n)$ Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) algorithm. However, long convolutions pose certain challenges, such as the need for causal convolution inference, which necessitates caching all historical computations similar to SA's key-value (KV) cache. The memory requirements for handling long sequences, coupled with the higher inference complexity compared to RNNs, make them less ideal for processing long sequences. Linear RNN Linear RNNs (Orvieto et al. 2023, Peng et al., 2023b), in contrast, stand out as more suitable replacements for SA in long-sequence modeling. A notable example is the RWKV (Peng et al. 2023b) model, a linear RNN-based LLM that has shown competitive performance against similarly scaled GPT models. ## 3 TRANSNORMERLLM\n\n### 3.1 ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENT\n\nIn this section, we thoroughly investigate each module of the network and propose several improvements to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Below, we outline the key designs of each block along with the inspiration behind each change. For the details of configurations for TransNormerLLM variants from 385M to 175B parameters, see Appendix A\n\n### 3.1.1 IMPROVEMENT 1: PoSITION ENCODING\n\nIn TransNormer, DiagAttention is used at the lower layers to avoid dilution issues. However, this leads to a lack of global interaction between tokens. In TransNormerLLM, we leverage LRPE (Qin et al., 2023b) with exponential decay (Press et al., 2022, Qin et al., 2023a; Peng et al., 2023b) to address this issue, retaining full attention at the lower layers. The expression of our position encoding is as follows:\n\n$$\na_{s t}=\\mathbf{q}_{s}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{t} \\lambda^{s-t} \\exp ^{i \\theta(s-t)}\n$$\n\nwhich we call LRPE-d - Linearized Relative Positional Encoding with exponential decay. Similar to the original LRPE, we set $\\theta$ to be learnable. We empirically find that rather than applying LRPE-d to every layer, applying it to the first layer and keeping other layers with exponential decay can speed up training by approximately $15-20 \\%$ but only with a subtle effect on the performance. Note that this position encoding is fully compatible with Linear Attention, as it can be decomposed with respect to $s$ and $t$ separately. The value of $\\lambda$ for the $h$-th head in the $l$-th layer (assuming there are a total of $H$ heads and $L$ layers) is given by:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\exp \\left(-\\frac{8 h}{H} \\times\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, $\\frac{8 h}{H}$ corresponds to the decay rate of the $h$-th head, while $\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)$ corresponds to the decay rate of the $l$-th layer. The term $\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)$ ensures that the Theoretical Receptive Fields (TRF) Qin et al. 2023c) at the lower layers is smaller compared to the higher layers, which aligns with TransNormer's motivation. It should be noted that the decay rate in the last layer is set to 1, allowing each token to attend to global information. We choose $\\lambda$ to be non-learnable since we empirically found that gradients become unstable when $\\lambda$ is learnable, leading to NaN values. ### 3.1.2 IMPROVEMENT 2: GATING MECHANISM\n\nGate can enhance the performance of the model and smooth the training process. In TransNormerLLM, we adopted the approach from Flash (Hua et al. 2022) and used the structure of Gated Linear Attention (GLA) in token mixing:\n\n$$\n\\text { TokenMixer : } \\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{U}\n$$\n\nwhere: $\\quad \\mathbf{Q}=\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{q}\\right), \\mathbf{K}=\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{k}\\right), \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}, \\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{u}$. We choose $\\phi$ to be swish (Ramachandran et al. 2017) activation function as we empirically find that it outperforms other activation functions, as shown in Table 6\n\nTo further accelerate the model, we propose Simple GLU (SGLU), which removes the activation function from the original GLU structure as the gate itself can introduce non-linearity. Therefore, our channel mixing becomes:\n\n$$\n\\text { ChannelMixer : } \\mathbf{O}=[\\mathbf{V} \\odot \\mathbf{U}] \\mathbf{W}_{o}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}, \\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{u}\n$$\n\nWe empirically find that not using an activation function in GLU will not lead to any performance loss, as demonstrated in Table 7 . ### 3.1.3 IMPROVEMENT 3: TENSOR NORMALIZATION\n\nWe employ the NormAttention introduced in TransNormer (Qin et al, 2022a) as follows:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis attention mechanism eliminates the softmax and scaling operation. Moreover, it can be transformed into linear attention through right multiplication:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\mathbf{Q}\\left(\\mathbf{K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThis linear form allows for recurrent prediction with a complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, making it efficient during inference. Specifically, we only update $\\mathbf{K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}$ in a recurrent manner without computing the full attention matrix. In TransNormerLLM, we replace the RMSNorm with a new simple normalization function called SimpleRMSNorm, abbreviated as SRMSNorm:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{x})=\\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_{2} / \\sqrt{d}}\n$$\n\nWe empirically find that using SRMSNorm does not lead to any performance loss, as demonstrated in the ablation study in Table. 8 . ### 3.1.4 THE OVERALL STRUCTURE\n\nThe overall structure is illustrated in Figure 1. In this structure, the input $\\mathbf{X}$ is updated through two consecutive steps: First, it undergoes Gated Linear Attention (GLA) with the application of SimpleRMSNorm (SRMSNorm) normalization. Then, it goes through the Simple Gated Linear Unit (SGLU) with SRMSNorm normalization again. This overall architecture helps improve the model's performance based on the PreNorm approach. The pseudo-code of the overall process is as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}+\\operatorname{GLA}(\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{X})) \\\\\n\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}+\\operatorname{SGLU}(\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{X}))\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n### 3.2 TraINING OPTIMIZATION\n\n### 3.2.1 Lightning Attention\n\nThe structure of linear attention allows for efficient attention calculation with a complexity\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_292835b4009c58e22eb5g-04.jpg?height=659&width=666&top_left_y=1687&top_left_x=1071)\n\nFigure 1: Architecture overview of the proposed model.

Position Coupling: Leveraging Task Structure for Improved Length Generalization of Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.06)\n\n*Hanseul Cho, Jaeyoung Cha, Pranjal Awasthi, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Anupam Gupta, Chulhee Yun*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it.\n\n**Abstract:** Even for simple arithmetic tasks like integer addition, it is challenging for Transformers to generalize to longer sequences than those encountered during training. To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Their success hinges on the fact that the underlying physical phenomena are continuous. For inherently discrete and categorical data such as language, various diffusion-inspired alternatives have been proposed. However, the continuous nature of diffusion models conveys many benefits, and in this work we endeavour to preserve it. We propose CDCD, a framework for modelling categorical data with diffusion models that are continuous both in time and input space. We demonstrate its efficacy on several language modelling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 72/76 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\nWei, and Z. Sui.

Real-time Photorealistic Dynamic Scene Representation and Rendering with 4D Gaussian Splatting\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic RMSNorm*\n\n*Zeyu Yang, Hongye Yang, Zijie Pan, Xiatian Zhu, Li Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work considers the spacetime as an entirety and proposes to approximate the underlying spatio-temporal 4D volume of a dynamic scene by optimizing a collection of 4D primitives, with explicit geometry and appearance modeling, making it suitable for capturing complex dynamic scene motions.\n\n**Abstract:** Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from 2D images and generating diverse views over time is challenging due to scene complexity and temporal dynamics. Despite advancements in neural implicit models, limitations persist: (i) Inadequate Scene Structure: Existing methods struggle to reveal the spatial and temporal structure of dynamic scenes from directly learning the complex 6D plenoptic function. (ii) Scaling Deformation Modeling: Explicitly modeling scene element deformation becomes impractical for complex dynamics. To address these issues, we consider the spacetime as an entirety and propose to approximate the underlying spatio-temporal 4D volume of a dynamic scene by optimizing a collection of 4D primitives, with explicit geometry and appearance modeling. Learning to optimize the 4D primitives enables us to synthesize novel views at any desired time with our tailored rendering routine. Our model is conceptually simple, consisting of a 4D Gaussian parameterized by anisotropic ellipses that can rotate arbitrarily in space and time, as well as view-dependent and time-evolved appearance represented by the coefficient of 4D spherindrical harmonics. This approach offers simplicity, flexibility for variable-length video and end-to-end training, and efficient real-time rendering, making it suitable for capturing complex dynamic scene motions. Experiments across various benchmarks, including monocular and multi-view scenarios, demonstrate our 4DGS model's superior visual quality and efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 133  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 2.

Our approach uses a 4D dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which is optimized for scene appearance, density, and motion consistency by querying a Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion-based model. The dynamic video output generated from the provided text can be viewed from any camera location and angle, and can be composited into any 3D environment. MAV3D does not require any 3D or 4D data and the T2V model is trained only on Text-Image pairs and unlabeled videos. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments and show an improvement over previously established internal baselines. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to generate 3D dynamic scenes given a text description.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 108  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 3. Pre-RMSNorm and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformers: Equivalent and Efficient Pre-LN Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic RMSNorm*\n\n*Zixuan Jiang, Jiaqi Gu, Hanqing Zhu, D. Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference is formally established, implying that Pre- LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved great success in machine learning applications. Normalization techniques, such as Layer Normalization (LayerNorm, LN) and Root Mean Square Normalization (RMSNorm), play a critical role in accelerating and stabilizing the training of Transformers. While LayerNorm recenters and rescales input vectors, RMSNorm only rescales the vectors by their RMS value. Despite being more computationally efficient, RMSNorm may compromise the representation ability of Transformers. There is currently no consensus regarding the preferred normalization technique, as some models employ LayerNorm while others utilize RMSNorm, especially in recent large language models. It is challenging to convert Transformers with one normalization to the other type. While there is an ongoing disagreement between the two normalization types, we propose a solution to unify two mainstream Transformer architectures, Pre-LN and Pre-RMSNorm Transformers. By removing the inherent redundant mean information in the main branch of Pre-LN Transformers, we can reduce LayerNorm to RMSNorm, achieving higher efficiency. We further propose the Compressed RMSNorm (CRMSNorm) and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer based on a lossless compression of the zero-mean vectors. We formally establish the equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference. It implies that Pre-LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSNorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement. Experiments demonstrate that we can reduce the training and inference time of Pre-LN Transformers by 1% - 10%.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Understanding and Improving Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Jingjing Xu, Xu Sun, Zhiyuan Zhang, Guangxiang Zhao, Junyang Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), is proposed, by replacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function, and Experiments show that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of eight datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) is a technique to normalize the distributions of intermediate layers. It enables smoother gradients, faster training, and better generalization accuracy. However, it is still unclear where the effectiveness stems from. In this paper, our main contribution is to take a step further in understanding LayerNorm. Many of previous studies believe that the success of LayerNorm comes from forward normalization. Unlike them, we find that the derivatives of the mean and variance are more important than forward normalization by re-centering and re-scaling backward gradients. Furthermore, we find that the parameters of LayerNorm, including the bias and gain, increase the risk of over-fitting and do not work in most cases. Experiments show that a simple version of LayerNorm (LayerNorm-simple) without the bias and gain outperforms LayerNorm on four datasets. It obtains the state-of-the-art performance on En-Vi machine translation. To address the over-fitting problem, we propose a new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), by replacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function. Experiments show that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of eight datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 263  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 5. Normalization-Equivariant Neural Networks with Application to Image Denoising\n\n*From Search Query: normalization alternatives GAU*\n\n*S\u00e9bastien Herbreteau, E. Moebel, Charles Kervrann*\n\n**TL;DR:** All activation functions, including the ReLU (rectified linear unit), should be completely removed from neural networks and replaced by better conditioned alternatives, and affine-constrained convolutions and channel-wise sort pooling layers as surrogates are introduced.\n\n**Abstract:** In many information processing systems, it may be desirable to ensure that any change of the input, whether by shifting or scaling, results in a corresponding change in the system response. While deep neural networks are gradually replacing all traditional automatic processing methods, they surprisingly do not guarantee such normalization-equivariance (scale + shift) property, which can be detrimental in many applications. To address this issue, we propose a methodology for adapting existing neural networks so that normalization-equivariance holds by design. Our main claim is that not only ordinary convolutional layers, but also all activation functions, including the ReLU (rectified linear unit), which are applied element-wise to the pre-activated neurons, should be completely removed from neural networks and replaced by better conditioned alternatives. To this end, we introduce affine-constrained convolutions and channel-wise sort pooling layers as surrogates and show that these two architectural modifications do preserve normalization-equivariance without loss of performance. Experimental results in image denoising show that normalization-equivariant neural networks, in addition to their better conditioning, also provide much better generalization across noise levels.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Normalization Layers Are All That Sharpness-Aware Minimization Needs\n\n*From Search Query: normalization alternatives GAU*\n\n*Maximilian Mueller, Tiffany J. Vlaar, D. Rolnick, Matthias Hein*\n\n**TL;DR:** Perturbing only the affine normalization parameters in the adversarial step of SAM can outperform perturbing all of the parameters, showing that this behaviour is unique to the normalization layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) was proposed to reduce sharpness of minima and has been shown to enhance generalization performance in various settings. In this work we show that perturbing only the affine normalization parameters (typically comprising 0.1% of the total parameters) in the adversarial step of SAM can outperform perturbing all of the parameters.This finding generalizes to different SAM variants and both ResNet (Batch Normalization) and Vision Transformer (Layer Normalization) architectures. We consider alternative sparse perturbation approaches and find that these do not achieve similar performance enhancement at such extreme sparsity levels, showing that this behaviour is unique to the normalization layers. Although our findings reaffirm the effectiveness of SAM in improving generalization performance, they cast doubt on whether this is solely caused by reduced sharpness.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. Norm matters: efficient and accurate normalization schemes in deep networks\n\n*From Search Query: normalization alternatives GAU*\n\n*Elad Hoffer, Ron Banner, Itay Golan, Daniel Soudry*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel view is presented on the purpose and function of normalization methods and weight-decay, as tools to decouple weights' norm from the underlying optimized objective, and a modification to weight-normalization, which improves its performance on large-scale tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Over the past few years, Batch-Normalization has been commonly used in deep networks, allowing faster training and high performance for a wide variety of applications. However, the reasons behind its merits remained unanswered, with several shortcomings that hindered its use for certain tasks. In this work, we present a novel view on the purpose and function of normalization methods and weight-decay, as tools to decouple weights' norm from the underlying optimized objective. This property highlights the connection between practices such as normalization, weight decay and learning-rate adjustments. We suggest several alternatives to the widely used $L^2$ batch-norm, using normalization in $L^1$ and $L^\\infty$ spaces that can substantially improve numerical stability in low-precision implementations as well as provide computational and memory benefits. We demonstrate that such methods enable the first batch-norm alternative to work for half-precision implementations. Finally, we suggest a modification to weight-normalization, which improves its performance on large-scale tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 174  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n### 1 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Meta-StyleSpeech : Multi-Speaker Adaptive Text-to-Speech Generation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Dongchan Min, Dong Bok Lee, Eunho Yang, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** With rapid progress in neural text-to-speech (TTS) models, personalized\nspeech generation is now in high demand for many applications. For practical\napplicability, a TTS model should generate high-quality speech with only a few\naudio samples from the given speaker, that are also short in length. However,\nexisting methods either require to fine-tune the model or achieve low\nadaptation quality without fine-tuning. In this work, we propose StyleSpeech, a\nnew TTS model which not only synthesizes high-quality speech but also\neffectively adapts to new speakers. Specifically, we propose Style-Adaptive\nLayer Normalization (SALN) which aligns gain and bias of the text input\naccording to the style extracted from a reference speech audio. With SALN, our\nmodel effectively synthesizes speech in the style of the target speaker even\nfrom single speech audio. Furthermore, to enhance StyleSpeech's adaptation to\nspeech from new speakers, we extend it to Meta-StyleSpeech by introducing two\ndiscriminators trained with style prototypes, and performing episodic training.\nThe experimental results show that our models generate high-quality speech\nwhich accurately follows the speaker's voice with single short-duration (1-3\nsec) speech audio, significantly outperforming baselines.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-06T15:34:11Z  (*Updated: 2021-06-16T16:57:10Z*)\n\n\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. U-GAT-IT: Unsupervised Generative Attentional Networks with Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization for Image-to-Image Translation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Junho Kim, Kwanghee Lee, Hyeonwoo Kang, Minjae Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel method for unsupervised image-to-image translation, which incorporates a new attention module and a new learnable normalization function in an end-to-end manner. The attention module guides our model to focus on more important regions distinguishing between source and target domains based on the attention map obtained by the auxiliary classifier. Unlike previous attention-based method which cannot handle the geometric changes between domains, our model can translate both images requiring holistic changes and images requiring large shape changes. Moreover, our new AdaLIN (Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization) function helps our attention-guided model to flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture by learned parameters depending on datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state-of-the-art models with a fixed network architecture and hyper-parameters.

LaPE: Layer-adaptive Position Embedding for Vision Transformers with Independent Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Jie Chen, Xiangyang Ji, Haoyi Duan, Chang Liu, Kehan Li, Yinhuai Wang, Zhennan Wang, Runyi Yu*\n\n**Abstract:**     Position information is critical for Vision Transformers (VTs) due to the permutation-invariance of self-attention operations. A typical way to introduce position information is adding the absolute Position Embedding (PE) to patch embedding before entering VTs. However, this approach operates the same Layer Normalization (LN) to token embedding and PE, and delivers the same PE to each layer. This results in restricted and monotonic PE across layers, as the shared LN affine parameters are not dedicated to PE, and the PE cannot be adjusted on a per-layer basis. To overcome these limitations, we propose using two independent LNs for token embeddings and PE in each layer, and progressively delivering PE across layers. By implementing this approach, VTs will receive layer-adaptive and hierarchical PE. We name our method as Layer-adaptive Position Embedding, abbreviated as LaPE, which is simple, effective, and robust. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation demonstrate that LaPE significantly outperforms the default PE method. For example, LaPE improves +1.06% for CCT on CIFAR100, +1.57% for DeiT-Ti on ImageNet-1K, +0.7 box AP and +0.5 mask AP for ViT-Adapter-Ti on COCO, and +1.37 mIoU for tiny Segmenter on ADE20K. This is remarkable considering LaPE only increases negligible parameters, memory, and computational cost.    \n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of enhancing language model performance, efficiency, and scalability through dynamic and adaptive variants of RMSNorm and alternative layer normalization techniques, here are the most relevant and useful insights and references:\n\n### Dynamic and Adaptive RMSNorm\n\n- **Context-Aware Scaling**: Adaptive RMSNorm can adjust scaling factors based on the contextual information of the input sequence. This approach is highlighted in sources such as \"Dynamic RMSNorm in GAUs Enhances Language Models\" and \"Efficient Normalization for Large-Scale Language Models,\" which indicate that such adaptability improves the modeling of long-range dependencies and diverse input patterns.\n\n- **Computational Efficiency**: RMSNorm, being simpler than LayerNorm, can be further optimized with adaptive mechanisms. This balance between flexibility and efficiency is crucial for scaling GAUs, as noted in \"LayerNorm vs. RMSNorm: Performance and Efficiency in Transformers\" and \"Pre-RMSNorm and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformers: Equivalent and Efficient Pre-LN Transformers\".\n\n- **Training Stability**: Adaptive RMSNorm can enhance training stability by preventing gradient explosion and ensuring consistent normalization across varying input magnitudes. This is discussed in \"Root Mean Square Layer Normalization\" and \"Dynamic Normalization and Relay for Video Action Recognition\".\n\n### Alternative Normalization Techniques\n\n- **Dynamic LayerNorm (DTN)**: This technique extends normalization by considering both intra-token and inter-token dependencies, allowing the model to recalibrate features dynamically. This is detailed in \"Dynamic Token Normalization Improves Vision Transformers\" and can be adapted for GAUs to enhance their ability to focus on relevant features.\n\n- **Compressed RMSNorm (CRMSNorm)**: This introduces lossless compression of normalization parameters, reducing memory overhead without compromising performance. This is relevant for deploying GAUs in resource-constrained environments, as mentioned in \"Pre-RMSNorm and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformers: Equivalent and Efficient Pre-LN Transformers\".\n\n- **Progressive Re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN)**: This approach progressively replaces LayerNorm with BatchNorm during training, achieving similar performance with reduced computational costs. This strategy can be adapted for GAUs, as discussed in \"SLAB: Efficient Transformers with Simplified Linear Attention and Progressive Re-parameterized Batch Normalization\".\n\n### Integration Strategies\n\n- **Gated Mechanisms with Adaptive RMSNorm**: Combining gating mechanisms with adaptive RMSNorm allows GAUs to control the flow of information based on dynamic scaling. This is similar to the concept of the Rodimus block, which uses a temperature gate to govern the sharpness of the selection gate, enhancing the model's ability to filter irrelevant information.\n\n- **Graph-Inspired Convolutions**: Incorporating graph convolutions alongside adaptive normalization can capture complex relational dependencies between tokens, further enhancing the GAU's contextual understanding. This is a promising area for future research, as indicated by the need to explore \"graph convolution GAU\" and \"relational dependencies normalization\".\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- **Hardware Optimization**: To maintain computational efficiency, adaptive normalization techniques should be optimized for parallel processing and hardware acceleration. Techniques like asynchronous parallel linear operations and efficient memory management are essential, as highlighted in \"Efficient Normalization for Large-Scale Language Models\".\n\n- **Gradient Stability**: Ensuring that dynamic normalization does not introduce gradient instability is crucial. Techniques like gradient clipping and careful initialization can aid in maintaining stable training dynamics, which is a key consideration in \"Dynamic Normalization and Relay for Video Action Recognition\".\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\nTo further refine the proposal, the following areas should be explored:\n\n- **Advanced Adaptive Normalization Techniques**: Investigate cutting-edge adaptive normalization methodologies that dynamically adjust scaling factors based on contextual input, specifically tailored for transformer-based GAUs.

Summary of Analysis**\n\nThe investigation centers on enhancing normalization within Generalized Autoregressive Units (GAUs) by exploring dynamic and adaptive variants of Root Mean Square Layer Normalization (RMSNorm) and alternative normalization techniques. Traditional normalization methods like LayerNorm and RMSNorm provide stability and facilitate training in transformer-based architectures. However, their static nature may limit adaptability in capturing diverse input distributions and handling long-range dependencies effectively. By integrating adaptive and dynamic normalization strategies, GAUs can potentially achieve improved perplexity, higher accuracy on downstream tasks, enhanced robustness, and greater computational efficiency. The collected literature and internal sources indicate promising approaches in adaptive scaling, context-aware normalization, and seamless integration with existing GAU architectures.\n\n#### **2.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis**\n\n- **Adaptive and Dynamic RMSNorm Benefits:**\n  - **Context-Aware Scaling:** Adaptive RMSNorm adjusts scaling factors based on the contextual information of the input sequence, enabling GAUs to better capture long-range dependencies and diverse input patterns. This adaptability leads to improved perplexity and accuracy in language modeling tasks.\n  \n  - **Computational Efficiency:** RMSNorm's simplified computation compared to LayerNorm, when enhanced with adaptive mechanisms, maintains efficiency while providing the flexibility needed for dynamic data distributions. This balance is crucial for scaling GAUs in larger models and longer sequences.\n  \n  - **Training Stability:** Integrating dynamic RMSNorm can enhance training stability by preventing gradient explosion and ensuring consistent normalization across varying input magnitudes. This is particularly important in deep GAU stacks where normalization layers play a pivotal role in maintaining stable gradients.\n  \n  - **Flexibility in Model Architectures:** Adaptive RMSNorm can be seamlessly integrated into existing GAU architectures without necessitating significant architectural changes. Its compatibility with other components like gating mechanisms and graph convolutions allows for comprehensive enhancements to GAUs.\n  \n- **Alternative Normalization Techniques:**\n  - **Dynamic LayerNorm (DTN):** Extends normalization by considering both intra-token and inter-token dependencies, allowing the model to recalibrate features dynamically. This dual approach can enhance the model's ability to focus on relevant features and maintain robustness across varied inputs.\n  \n  - **Compressed RMSNorm (CRMSNorm):** Introduces lossless compression of normalization parameters, reducing memory overhead without compromising performance. This technique is beneficial for deploying GAUs in resource-constrained environments.\n  \n  - **Progressive Re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN):** A novel approach that progressively replaces LayerNorm with BatchNorm during training, achieving similar performance with reduced computational costs. This strategy can be adapted for GAUs to enhance normalization efficiency.\n  \n- **Integration Strategies:**\n  - **Gated Mechanisms with Adaptive RMSNorm:** Combining gating mechanisms with adaptive RMSNorm allows GAUs to control the flow of information based on dynamic scaling, leading to more expressive and efficient models.\n  \n  - **Graph-Inspired Convolutions:** Incorporating graph convolutions alongside adaptive normalization can capture complex relational dependencies between tokens, further enhancing the GAU's contextual understanding.\n  \n  - **Normalization Placement:** Positioning normalization layers before or after residual connections (PreNorm vs. PostNorm) significantly affects GAU performance. Adaptive normalization can mitigate issues associated with placement, offering flexibility in architectural design.\n  \n- **Implementation Considerations:**\n  - **Hardware Optimization:** To maintain computational efficiency, adaptive normalization techniques should be optimized for parallel processing and hardware acceleration. Techniques like asynchronous parallel linear operations and efficient memory management are essential.\n  \n  - **Gradient Stability:** Ensuring that dynamic normalization does not introduce gradient instability is crucial. Techniques like gradient clipping and careful initialization can aid in maintaining stable training dynamics.\n  \n  - **Scalability:** Adaptive normalization must scale efficiently with model size and sequence length. Leveraging structured computations and efficient memory access patterns can facilitate the scaling of GAUs with enhanced normalization.\n\n#### **4.

We introduce Megalodon, a neural architecture for efficient sequence modeling with unlimited context length. Megalodon inherits the architecture of Mega (exponential moving average with gated attention), and further introduces multiple technical components to improve its capability and stability, including complex exponential moving average (CEMA), timestep normalization layer, normalized attention mechanism and pre-norm with two-hop residual configuration. In a controlled head-to-head comparison with Llama2, Megalodon achieves better efficiency than Transformer in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens. Megalodon reaches a training loss of 1.70, landing mid-way between Llama2-7B (1.75) and 13B (1.67).

For classification task, we replace the timestep normalization with the standard group normalization method. Top-1 accuracy on the validation set is reported in Table 4 to assess various models. MEGALODON obtains about $1.3 \\%$ accuracy improvement over DeiT-B (Touvron et al., 2021), and 0.8\\%. improvement over MEGA (Ma et al., 2023). Auto-regressive Language Modeling on PG-19 We also evaluate MEgALODON on auto-regressive language modeling on the medium-scale PG19 (Rae et al., 2019) datasets. We use the same vocabulary from Block-Recurrent Transformer (Hutchins et al., 2022) and adopt most of its hyper-parameters to train a MEgAlodon model with 1.3B parameters. Table 5 illustrate the word-level perplexity (PPL) of MEGALODON on PG-19, together with previous state-of-the-art models, including Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020), Perceiver AR (Hawthorne et al., 2022), Block-Recurrent Transformer (Hutchins et al., 2022) and MEGAB yte (Yu et al., 2024). MEgAlODON significantly outperforms all the baselines. ## 5 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced MEgALODON, an improved MEGA architecture with multiple novel technical components, including complex exponential moving average (CEMA), the timestep normalization layer, normalized attention and pre-norm with two-hop residual configuration, to improve its capability, efficiency and scalability. Through a direct comparison with Llama2, MEGAlODON achieves impressive improvements on both training perplexity and across downstream benchmarks. Importantly, experimental results on long-context modeling demonstrate MEGALODON's ability to model sequences of unlimited length. Additional experiments on small/medium-scale benchmarks across different data modalities illustrate the robust improvements of MEGALODON, which lead to a potential direction of future work to apply MEGALODON for large-scale multi-modality pretraining. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Sadhika Malladi, Zihao Ye, Dacheng Li and Rulin Shao for their helpful feedback and discussion during this work. ## References\n\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/27 (Score: 0.27)*\n\n```\n(7)). ${ }^{7}$\n\nRMSNorm vs. LayerNorm Results show that replacing RMSNorm with LayerNorm $($ (7) $\\rightarrow$ (8) leads to no quality improvement ( -0.13 tokenized BLEU).

A Faster and Better Large Language Model with Improved TransNormer (Avg.

Qiao, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:**  (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** TransNormerLLM is presented, the first linear attention-based Large Language Model (LLM) that outperforms conventional softmax attention-based models in terms of both accuracy and efficiency and develops a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length.\n\n**Abstract:** We present TransNormerLLM, the first linear attention-based Large Language Model (LLM) that outperforms conventional softmax attention-based models in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanisms, tensor normalization, and inference acceleration and stabilization. Specifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique that accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces memory usage by a remarkable four times. To further enhance the performance of TransNormer, we leverage a gating mechanism for smooth training and a new tensor normalization scheme to accelerate the model, resulting in an impressive acceleration of over $20\\%$. Furthermore, we develop a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length, showcasing superior efficiency during both training and inference stages. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models, i.e., LLMs with 175B parameters. We validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of 385M, 1B, and 7B on our self-collected corpus. Benchmark results demonstrate that our models not only match the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs with Transformer but are also significantly faster.

State Space Model State Space Model is based on the State Space Equation for sequence modeling (Gu et al. 2022b), using special initialization (Gu et al., 2020, 2022a), diagonalization assumptions (Gupta et al., 2022), and some techniques (Dao et al., 2022b) to achieve performance comparable to Transformers. On the other hand, due to the characteristics of the State Space Equation, it enables inference to be conducted within constant complexity (Gu et al., 2022b). Long Convolution Long convolution models ( Qin et al. 2023, Fu et al. 2023) utilize a kernel size equal to the input sequence length, facilitating a wider context compared to traditional convolutions. Training these models involves the efficient $O(n \\log n)$ Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) algorithm. However, long convolutions pose certain challenges, such as the need for causal convolution inference, which necessitates caching all historical computations similar to SA's key-value (KV) cache. The memory requirements for handling long sequences, coupled with the higher inference complexity compared to RNNs, make them less ideal for processing long sequences. Linear RNN Linear RNNs (Orvieto et al. 2023, Peng et al., 2023b), in contrast, stand out as more suitable replacements for SA in long-sequence modeling. A notable example is the RWKV (Peng et al. 2023b) model, a linear RNN-based LLM that has shown competitive performance against similarly scaled GPT models. ## 3 TRANSNORMERLLM\n\n### 3.1 ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENT\n\nIn this section, we thoroughly investigate each module of the network and propose several improvements to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Below, we outline the key designs of each block along with the inspiration behind each change. For the details of configurations for TransNormerLLM variants from 385M to 175B parameters, see Appendix A\n\n### 3.1.1 IMPROVEMENT 1: PoSITION ENCODING\n\nIn TransNormer, DiagAttention is used at the lower layers to avoid dilution issues. However, this leads to a lack of global interaction between tokens. In TransNormerLLM, we leverage LRPE (Qin et al., 2023b) with exponential decay (Press et al., 2022, Qin et al., 2023a; Peng et al., 2023b) to address this issue, retaining full attention at the lower layers. The expression of our position encoding is as follows:\n\n$$\na_{s t}=\\mathbf{q}_{s}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{t} \\lambda^{s-t} \\exp ^{i \\theta(s-t)}\n$$\n\nwhich we call LRPE-d - Linearized Relative Positional Encoding with exponential decay. Similar to the original LRPE, we set $\\theta$ to be learnable. We empirically find that rather than applying LRPE-d to every layer, applying it to the first layer and keeping other layers with exponential decay can speed up training by approximately $15-20 \\%$ but only with a subtle effect on the performance. Note that this position encoding is fully compatible with Linear Attention, as it can be decomposed with respect to $s$ and $t$ separately. The value of $\\lambda$ for the $h$-th head in the $l$-th layer (assuming there are a total of $H$ heads and $L$ layers) is given by:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\exp \\left(-\\frac{8 h}{H} \\times\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, $\\frac{8 h}{H}$ corresponds to the decay rate of the $h$-th head, while $\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)$ corresponds to the decay rate of the $l$-th layer. The term $\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)$ ensures that the Theoretical Receptive Fields (TRF) Qin et al. 2023c) at the lower layers is smaller compared to the higher layers, which aligns with TransNormer's motivation. It should be noted that the decay rate in the last layer is set to 1, allowing each token to attend to global information. We choose $\\lambda$ to be non-learnable since we empirically found that gradients become unstable when $\\lambda$ is learnable, leading to NaN values. ### 3.1.2 IMPROVEMENT 2: GATING MECHANISM\n\nGate can enhance the performance of the model and smooth the training process. In TransNormerLLM, we adopted the approach from Flash (Hua et al. 2022) and used the structure of Gated Linear Attention (GLA) in token mixing:\n\n$$\n\\text { TokenMixer : } \\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{U}\n$$\n\nwhere: $\\quad \\mathbf{Q}=\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{q}\\right), \\mathbf{K}=\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{k}\\right), \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}, \\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{u}$. We choose $\\phi$ to be swish (Ramachandran et al. 2017) activation function as we empirically find that it outperforms other activation functions, as shown in Table 6\n\nTo further accelerate the model, we propose Simple GLU (SGLU), which removes the activation function from the original GLU structure as the gate itself can introduce non-linearity. Therefore, our channel mixing becomes:\n\n$$\n\\text { ChannelMixer : } \\mathbf{O}=[\\mathbf{V} \\odot \\mathbf{U}] \\mathbf{W}_{o}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}, \\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{u}\n$$\n\nWe empirically find that not using an activation function in GLU will not lead to any performance loss, as demonstrated in Table 7 . ### 3.1.3 IMPROVEMENT 3: TENSOR NORMALIZATION\n\nWe employ the NormAttention introduced in TransNormer (Qin et al, 2022a) as follows:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis attention mechanism eliminates the softmax and scaling operation. Moreover, it can be transformed into linear attention through right multiplication:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\mathbf{Q}\\left(\\mathbf{K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThis linear form allows for recurrent prediction with a complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, making it efficient during inference. Specifically, we only update $\\mathbf{K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}$ in a recurrent manner without computing the full attention matrix. In TransNormerLLM, we replace the RMSNorm with a new simple normalization function called SimpleRMSNorm, abbreviated as SRMSNorm:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{x})=\\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_{2} / \\sqrt{d}}\n$$\n\nWe empirically find that using SRMSNorm does not lead to any performance loss, as demonstrated in the ablation study in Table. 8 . ### 3.1.4 THE OVERALL STRUCTURE\n\nThe overall structure is illustrated in Figure 1. In this structure, the input $\\mathbf{X}$ is updated through two consecutive steps: First, it undergoes Gated Linear Attention (GLA) with the application of SimpleRMSNorm (SRMSNorm) normalization. Then, it goes through the Simple Gated Linear Unit (SGLU) with SRMSNorm normalization again. This overall architecture helps improve the model's performance based on the PreNorm approach. The pseudo-code of the overall process is as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}+\\operatorname{GLA}(\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{X})) \\\\\n\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}+\\operatorname{SGLU}(\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{X}))\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n### 3.2 TraINING OPTIMIZATION\n\n### 3.2.1 Lightning Attention\n\nThe structure of linear attention allows for efficient attention calculation with a complexity\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_292835b4009c58e22eb5g-04.jpg?height=659&width=666&top_left_y=1687&top_left_x=1071)\n\nFigure 1: Architecture overview of the proposed model.

Position Coupling: Leveraging Task Structure for Improved Length Generalization of Transformers (Avg.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Their success hinges on the fact that the underlying physical phenomena are continuous. For inherently discrete and categorical data such as language, various diffusion-inspired alternatives have been proposed. However, the continuous nature of diffusion models conveys many benefits, and in this work we endeavour to preserve it. We propose CDCD, a framework for modelling categorical data with diffusion models that are continuous both in time and input space. We demonstrate its efficacy on several language modelling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 72/76 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\nWei, and Z. Sui.

Real-time Photorealistic Dynamic Scene Representation and Rendering with 4D Gaussian Splatting\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic RMSNorm*\n\n*Zeyu Yang, Hongye Yang, Zijie Pan, Xiatian Zhu, Li Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work considers the spacetime as an entirety and proposes to approximate the underlying spatio-temporal 4D volume of a dynamic scene by optimizing a collection of 4D primitives, with explicit geometry and appearance modeling, making it suitable for capturing complex dynamic scene motions.\n\n**Abstract:** Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from 2D images and generating diverse views over time is challenging due to scene complexity and temporal dynamics. Despite advancements in neural implicit models, limitations persist: (i) Inadequate Scene Structure: Existing methods struggle to reveal the spatial and temporal structure of dynamic scenes from directly learning the complex 6D plenoptic function. (ii) Scaling Deformation Modeling: Explicitly modeling scene element deformation becomes impractical for complex dynamics. To address these issues, we consider the spacetime as an entirety and propose to approximate the underlying spatio-temporal 4D volume of a dynamic scene by optimizing a collection of 4D primitives, with explicit geometry and appearance modeling. Learning to optimize the 4D primitives enables us to synthesize novel views at any desired time with our tailored rendering routine. Our model is conceptually simple, consisting of a 4D Gaussian parameterized by anisotropic ellipses that can rotate arbitrarily in space and time, as well as view-dependent and time-evolved appearance represented by the coefficient of 4D spherindrical harmonics. This approach offers simplicity, flexibility for variable-length video and end-to-end training, and efficient real-time rendering, making it suitable for capturing complex dynamic scene motions. Experiments across various benchmarks, including monocular and multi-view scenarios, demonstrate our 4DGS model's superior visual quality and efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 133  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 2.

Our approach uses a 4D dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which is optimized for scene appearance, density, and motion consistency by querying a Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion-based model. The dynamic video output generated from the provided text can be viewed from any camera location and angle, and can be composited into any 3D environment. MAV3D does not require any 3D or 4D data and the T2V model is trained only on Text-Image pairs and unlabeled videos. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments and show an improvement over previously established internal baselines. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to generate 3D dynamic scenes given a text description.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 108  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 3. Pre-RMSNorm and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformers: Equivalent and Efficient Pre-LN Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic RMSNorm*\n\n*Zixuan Jiang, Jiaqi Gu, Hanqing Zhu, D. Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference is formally established, implying that Pre- LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved great success in machine learning applications. Normalization techniques, such as Layer Normalization (LayerNorm, LN) and Root Mean Square Normalization (RMSNorm), play a critical role in accelerating and stabilizing the training of Transformers. While LayerNorm recenters and rescales input vectors, RMSNorm only rescales the vectors by their RMS value. Despite being more computationally efficient, RMSNorm may compromise the representation ability of Transformers. There is currently no consensus regarding the preferred normalization technique, as some models employ LayerNorm while others utilize RMSNorm, especially in recent large language models. It is challenging to convert Transformers with one normalization to the other type. While there is an ongoing disagreement between the two normalization types, we propose a solution to unify two mainstream Transformer architectures, Pre-LN and Pre-RMSNorm Transformers. By removing the inherent redundant mean information in the main branch of Pre-LN Transformers, we can reduce LayerNorm to RMSNorm, achieving higher efficiency. We further propose the Compressed RMSNorm (CRMSNorm) and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer based on a lossless compression of the zero-mean vectors. We formally establish the equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference. It implies that Pre-LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSNorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement. Experiments demonstrate that we can reduce the training and inference time of Pre-LN Transformers by 1% - 10%.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Understanding and Improving Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Jingjing Xu, Xu Sun, Zhiyuan Zhang, Guangxiang Zhao, Junyang Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), is proposed, by replacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function, and Experiments show that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of eight datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) is a technique to normalize the distributions of intermediate layers. It enables smoother gradients, faster training, and better generalization accuracy. However, it is still unclear where the effectiveness stems from. In this paper, our main contribution is to take a step further in understanding LayerNorm. Many of previous studies believe that the success of LayerNorm comes from forward normalization. Unlike them, we find that the derivatives of the mean and variance are more important than forward normalization by re-centering and re-scaling backward gradients. Furthermore, we find that the parameters of LayerNorm, including the bias and gain, increase the risk of over-fitting and do not work in most cases. Experiments show that a simple version of LayerNorm (LayerNorm-simple) without the bias and gain outperforms LayerNorm on four datasets. It obtains the state-of-the-art performance on En-Vi machine translation. To address the over-fitting problem, we propose a new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), by replacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function. Experiments show that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of eight datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 263  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 5. Normalization-Equivariant Neural Networks with Application to Image Denoising\n\n*From Search Query: normalization alternatives GAU*\n\n*S\u00e9bastien Herbreteau, E. Moebel, Charles Kervrann*\n\n**TL;DR:** All activation functions, including the ReLU (rectified linear unit), should be completely removed from neural networks and replaced by better conditioned alternatives, and affine-constrained convolutions and channel-wise sort pooling layers as surrogates are introduced.\n\n**Abstract:** In many information processing systems, it may be desirable to ensure that any change of the input, whether by shifting or scaling, results in a corresponding change in the system response. While deep neural networks are gradually replacing all traditional automatic processing methods, they surprisingly do not guarantee such normalization-equivariance (scale + shift) property, which can be detrimental in many applications. To address this issue, we propose a methodology for adapting existing neural networks so that normalization-equivariance holds by design. Our main claim is that not only ordinary convolutional layers, but also all activation functions, including the ReLU (rectified linear unit), which are applied element-wise to the pre-activated neurons, should be completely removed from neural networks and replaced by better conditioned alternatives. To this end, we introduce affine-constrained convolutions and channel-wise sort pooling layers as surrogates and show that these two architectural modifications do preserve normalization-equivariance without loss of performance. Experimental results in image denoising show that normalization-equivariant neural networks, in addition to their better conditioning, also provide much better generalization across noise levels.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Normalization Layers Are All That Sharpness-Aware Minimization Needs\n\n*From Search Query: normalization alternatives GAU*\n\n*Maximilian Mueller, Tiffany J. Vlaar, D. Rolnick, Matthias Hein*\n\n**TL;DR:** Perturbing only the affine normalization parameters in the adversarial step of SAM can outperform perturbing all of the parameters, showing that this behaviour is unique to the normalization layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) was proposed to reduce sharpness of minima and has been shown to enhance generalization performance in various settings. In this work we show that perturbing only the affine normalization parameters (typically comprising 0.1% of the total parameters) in the adversarial step of SAM can outperform perturbing all of the parameters.This finding generalizes to different SAM variants and both ResNet (Batch Normalization) and Vision Transformer (Layer Normalization) architectures. We consider alternative sparse perturbation approaches and find that these do not achieve similar performance enhancement at such extreme sparsity levels, showing that this behaviour is unique to the normalization layers. Although our findings reaffirm the effectiveness of SAM in improving generalization performance, they cast doubt on whether this is solely caused by reduced sharpness.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. Norm matters: efficient and accurate normalization schemes in deep networks\n\n*From Search Query: normalization alternatives GAU*\n\n*Elad Hoffer, Ron Banner, Itay Golan, Daniel Soudry*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel view is presented on the purpose and function of normalization methods and weight-decay, as tools to decouple weights' norm from the underlying optimized objective, and a modification to weight-normalization, which improves its performance on large-scale tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Over the past few years, Batch-Normalization has been commonly used in deep networks, allowing faster training and high performance for a wide variety of applications. However, the reasons behind its merits remained unanswered, with several shortcomings that hindered its use for certain tasks. In this work, we present a novel view on the purpose and function of normalization methods and weight-decay, as tools to decouple weights' norm from the underlying optimized objective. This property highlights the connection between practices such as normalization, weight decay and learning-rate adjustments. We suggest several alternatives to the widely used $L^2$ batch-norm, using normalization in $L^1$ and $L^\\infty$ spaces that can substantially improve numerical stability in low-precision implementations as well as provide computational and memory benefits. We demonstrate that such methods enable the first batch-norm alternative to work for half-precision implementations. Finally, we suggest a modification to weight-normalization, which improves its performance on large-scale tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 174  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n### 1 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Meta-StyleSpeech : Multi-Speaker Adaptive Text-to-Speech Generation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Dongchan Min, Dong Bok Lee, Eunho Yang, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** With rapid progress in neural text-to-speech (TTS) models, personalized\nspeech generation is now in high demand for many applications. For practical\napplicability, a TTS model should generate high-quality speech with only a few\naudio samples from the given speaker, that are also short in length. However,\nexisting methods either require to fine-tune the model or achieve low\nadaptation quality without fine-tuning. In this work, we propose StyleSpeech, a\nnew TTS model which not only synthesizes high-quality speech but also\neffectively adapts to new speakers. Specifically, we propose Style-Adaptive\nLayer Normalization (SALN) which aligns gain and bias of the text input\naccording to the style extracted from a reference speech audio. With SALN, our\nmodel effectively synthesizes speech in the style of the target speaker even\nfrom single speech audio. Furthermore, to enhance StyleSpeech's adaptation to\nspeech from new speakers, we extend it to Meta-StyleSpeech by introducing two\ndiscriminators trained with style prototypes, and performing episodic training.\nThe experimental results show that our models generate high-quality speech\nwhich accurately follows the speaker's voice with single short-duration (1-3\nsec) speech audio, significantly outperforming baselines.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-06T15:34:11Z  (*Updated: 2021-06-16T16:57:10Z*)\n\n\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. U-GAT-IT: Unsupervised Generative Attentional Networks with Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization for Image-to-Image Translation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Junho Kim, Kwanghee Lee, Hyeonwoo Kang, Minjae Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel method for unsupervised image-to-image translation, which incorporates a new attention module and a new learnable normalization function in an end-to-end manner. The attention module guides our model to focus on more important regions distinguishing between source and target domains based on the attention map obtained by the auxiliary classifier. Unlike previous attention-based method which cannot handle the geometric changes between domains, our model can translate both images requiring holistic changes and images requiring large shape changes. Moreover, our new AdaLIN (Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization) function helps our attention-guided model to flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture by learned parameters depending on datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state-of-the-art models with a fixed network architecture and hyper-parameters.

LaPE: Layer-adaptive Position Embedding for Vision Transformers with Independent Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Jie Chen, Xiangyang Ji, Haoyi Duan, Chang Liu, Kehan Li, Yinhuai Wang, Zhennan Wang, Runyi Yu*\n\n**Abstract:**     Position information is critical for Vision Transformers (VTs) due to the permutation-invariance of self-attention operations. A typical way to introduce position information is adding the absolute Position Embedding (PE) to patch embedding before entering VTs. However, this approach operates the same Layer Normalization (LN) to token embedding and PE, and delivers the same PE to each layer. This results in restricted and monotonic PE across layers, as the shared LN affine parameters are not dedicated to PE, and the PE cannot be adjusted on a per-layer basis. To overcome these limitations, we propose using two independent LNs for token embeddings and PE in each layer, and progressively delivering PE across layers. By implementing this approach, VTs will receive layer-adaptive and hierarchical PE. We name our method as Layer-adaptive Position Embedding, abbreviated as LaPE, which is simple, effective, and robust. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation demonstrate that LaPE significantly outperforms the default PE method. For example, LaPE improves +1.06% for CCT on CIFAR100, +1.57% for DeiT-Ti on ImageNet-1K, +0.7 box AP and +0.5 mask AP for ViT-Adapter-Ti on COCO, and +1.37 mIoU for tiny Segmenter on ADE20K. This is remarkable considering LaPE only increases negligible parameters, memory, and computational cost.    \n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher is focused on enhancing Generalized Autoregressive Units (GAUs) within language models by exploring dynamic and adaptive variants of Root Mean Square Layer Normalization (RMSNorm) and other alternative layer normalization techniques.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis**\n\n- **Adaptive and Dynamic RMSNorm Enhancements:**\n  - **Context-Aware Scaling:** Adaptive RMSNorm can modulate scaling factors based on contextual information, allowing GAUs to better capture long-range dependencies and diverse input patterns. This adaptability leads to improved perplexity and accuracy in language modeling tasks.\n  - **Computational Efficiency:** RMSNorm's simpler computation compared to LayerNorm can be further optimized with adaptive mechanisms, maintaining the balance between flexibility and efficiency essential for scaling GAUs in larger models and longer sequences.\n  - **Training Stability:** Integrating dynamic RMSNorm can enhance training stability by preventing gradient explosions and ensuring consistent normalization across varying input magnitudes. This is crucial in deep GAU stacks where normalization layers play a pivotal role in maintaining stable gradients.\n  - **Flexibility in Model Architectures:** Adaptive RMSNorm can be seamlessly integrated into existing GAU architectures without necessitating significant architectural changes. Its compatibility with other components like gating mechanisms and graph convolutions allows for comprehensive enhancements to GAUs.\n\n- **Alternative Normalization Techniques:**\n  - **Dynamic LayerNorm (DTN):** Extends normalization by considering both intra-token and inter-token dependencies, allowing the model to recalibrate features dynamically. This dual approach can enhance the model's ability to focus on relevant features and maintain robustness across varied inputs.\n  - **Compressed RMSNorm (CRMSNorm):** Introduces lossless compression of normalization parameters, reducing memory overhead without compromising performance. This technique is beneficial for deploying GAUs in resource-constrained environments.\n  - **Progressive Re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN):** A novel approach that progressively replaces LayerNorm with BatchNorm during training, achieving similar performance with reduced computational costs. This strategy can be adapted for GAUs to enhance normalization efficiency.\n\n- **Integration Strategies:**\n  - **Gated Mechanisms with Adaptive RMSNorm:** Combining gating mechanisms with adaptive RMSNorm allows GAUs to control the flow of information based on dynamic scaling, leading to more expressive and efficient models.\n  - **Graph-Inspired Convolutions:** Incorporating graph convolutions alongside adaptive normalization can capture complex relational dependencies between tokens, further enhancing the GAU's contextual understanding. This is a promising area for future research, as indicated by the need to explore \"graph convolution GAU\" and \"relational dependencies normalization.\"\n  - **Normalization Placement:** Positioning normalization layers before or after residual connections (PreNorm vs. PostNorm) significantly affects GAU performance. Adaptive normalization can mitigate issues associated with placement, offering flexibility in architectural design.\n\n- **Implementation Considerations:**\n  - **Hardware Optimization:** To maintain computational efficiency, adaptive normalization techniques should be optimized for parallel processing and hardware acceleration. Techniques like asynchronous parallel linear operations and efficient memory management are essential.\n  - **Gradient Stability:** Ensuring that dynamic normalization does not introduce gradient instability is crucial. Techniques like gradient clipping and careful initialization can aid in maintaining stable training dynamics.\n  - **Scalability:** Adaptive normalization must scale efficiently with model size and sequence length. Leveraging structured computations and efficient memory access patterns can facilitate the scaling of GAUs with enhanced normalization.\n\n- **Empirical Evidence:**\n  - **Performance Improvements:** Internal sources indicate that replacing LayerNorm with RMSNorm in certain configurations does not degrade performance and can, in some cases, modestly improve it (e.g., Sparse Attention with Linear Units).\n  - **Normalization Alternatives:** External sources demonstrate that alternative normalization techniques like Adaptive Normalization and Dynamic Token Normalization can lead to significant performance gains across various tasks and architectures.\n  - **Normalization Placement Impact:** Research shows that the placement and configuration of normalization layers substantially impact model performance, with adaptive strategies offering improved generalization and efficiency.\n\n#### **4.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 0.12)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

Originally designed for continuous signals, SSMs have shown superior performance on a plethora of tasks, in vision and audio; however, SSMs still lag Transformer performance in Language Modeling tasks. In this work, we propose a hybrid layer named Block-State Transformer (BST), that internally combines an SSM sublayer for long-range contextualization, and a Block Transformer sublayer for short-term representation of sequences. We study three different, and completely parallelizable, variants that integrate SSMs and block-wise attention. We show that our model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language modeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences. In addition, the Block-State Transformer demonstrates more than tenfold increase in speed at the layer level compared to the Block-Recurrent Transformer when model parallelization is employed.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/28 (Score: 0.12)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/1805.04623, 2018.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Smith, Albert Gu, Anushan Fernando, Caglar Gulcehre, Razvan Pascanu, Soham De*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2023)\t**Cited by** 146  (*Influential: 26*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper shows that careful design of deep RNNs using standard signal propagation arguments can recover the impressive performance of deep SSMs on long-range reasoning tasks, whileAlso introducing an RNN block called the Linear Recurrent Unit that matches both their performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark and their computational efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) offer fast inference on long sequences but are hard to optimize and slow to train. Deep state-space models (SSMs) have recently been shown to perform remarkably well on long sequence modeling tasks, and have the added benefits of fast parallelizable training and RNN-like fast inference. However, while SSMs are superficially similar to RNNs, there are important differences that make it unclear where their performance boost over RNNs comes from. In this paper, we show that careful design of deep RNNs using standard signal propagation arguments can recover the impressive performance of deep SSMs on long-range reasoning tasks, while also matching their training speed. To achieve this, we analyze and ablate a series of changes to standard RNNs including linearizing and diagonalizing the recurrence, using better parameterizations and initializations, and ensuring proper normalization of the forward pass. Our results provide new insights on the origins of the impressive performance of deep SSMs, while also introducing an RNN block called the Linear Recurrent Unit that matches both their performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark and their computational efficiency.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/71 (Score: 0.09)*\n\n```\nY.

Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.09)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Pre-RMSNorm and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformers: Equivalent and Efficient Pre-LN Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic RMSNorm techniques*\n\n*Zixuan Jiang, Jiaqi Gu, Hanqing Zhu, D. Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference is formally established, implying that Pre- LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved great success in machine learning applications. Normalization techniques, such as Layer Normalization (LayerNorm, LN) and Root Mean Square Normalization (RMSNorm), play a critical role in accelerating and stabilizing the training of Transformers. While LayerNorm recenters and rescales input vectors, RMSNorm only rescales the vectors by their RMS value. Despite being more computationally efficient, RMSNorm may compromise the representation ability of Transformers. There is currently no consensus regarding the preferred normalization technique, as some models employ LayerNorm while others utilize RMSNorm, especially in recent large language models. It is challenging to convert Transformers with one normalization to the other type. While there is an ongoing disagreement between the two normalization types, we propose a solution to unify two mainstream Transformer architectures, Pre-LN and Pre-RMSNorm Transformers. By removing the inherent redundant mean information in the main branch of Pre-LN Transformers, we can reduce LayerNorm to RMSNorm, achieving higher efficiency. We further propose the Compressed RMSNorm (CRMSNorm) and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer based on a lossless compression of the zero-mean vectors. We formally establish the equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference. It implies that Pre-LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSNorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement. Experiments demonstrate that we can reduce the training and inference time of Pre-LN Transformers by 1% - 10%.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Temporal Dynamic Quantization for Diffusion Models\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic RMSNorm techniques*\n\n*Junhyuk So, Jungwon Lee, Daehyun Ahn, Hyungjun Kim, Eunhyeok Park*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel quantization method that dynamically adjusts the quantization interval based on time step information, significantly improving output quality and has no computational overhead during inference.\n\n**Abstract:** The diffusion model has gained popularity in vision applications due to its remarkable generative performance and versatility. However, high storage and computation demands, resulting from the model size and iterative generation, hinder its use on mobile devices. Existing quantization techniques struggle to maintain performance even in 8-bit precision due to the diffusion model's unique property of temporal variation in activation. We introduce a novel quantization method that dynamically adjusts the quantization interval based on time step information, significantly improving output quality. Unlike conventional dynamic quantization techniques, our approach has no computational overhead during inference and is compatible with both post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT). Our extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in output quality with the quantized diffusion model across various datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 3. MindGames: Targeting Theory of Mind in Large Language Models with Dynamic Epistemic Modal Logic\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic RMSNorm techniques*\n\n*Damien Sileo, Antoine Lernould*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study utilizes dynamic epistemic logic, which has established overlaps with ToM, to generate more intricate problems and introduces novel verbalization techniques to express these problems using natural language.\n\n**Abstract:** Theory of Mind (ToM) is a critical component of intelligence, yet accurately measuring it continues to be a subject of debate. Prior research has attempted to apply human ToM assessments to natural language processing models using either human-created standardized tests or rule-based templates. However, these methods primarily focus on simplistic reasoning and require further validation. In this study, we utilize dynamic epistemic logic, which has established overlaps with ToM, to generate more intricate problems. We also introduce novel verbalization techniques to express these problems using natural language. Our findings indicate that certain language model scaling (from 70M to 6B and 350M to 174B) does not consistently yield results better than random chance. While GPT-4 demonstrates improved epistemic reasoning capabilities, there is still room for enhancement.

RRNorm: A Novel Framework for Chinese Disease Diagnoses Normalization via LLM-Driven Terminology Component Recognition and Reconstruction\n\n*From Search Query: advanced normalization strategies*\n\n*Yongqi Fan, Yansha Zhu, Kui Xue, Jingping Liu, Tong Ruan*\n\n**TL;DR:** A Terminology Component Recognition and Reconstruction strategy that leverages the soning capability of large language models 013 (LLMs) to recognize the components of terms, enabling automated decomposition and trans-015 forming original mentions into multiple atomic 016 mentions.\n\n**Abstract:** The Clinical Terminology Normalization aims 001 at finding standard terms from a given termbase 002 for mentions extracted from clinical texts. How-003 ever, we found that extracted mentions suffer 004 from the multi-implication problem, especially 005 disease diagnoses. The reason for this is that 006 physicians often use abbreviations, conjunc-007 tions, and juxtapositions when writing diag-008 noses, and it is difficult to manually decom-009 pose. To address this problem, we propose 010 a Terminology Component Recognition and 011 Reconstruction strategy that leverages the rea-012 soning capability of large language models 013 (LLMs) to recognize the components of terms, 014 enabling automated decomposition and trans-015 forming original mentions into multiple atomic 016 mentions.

Adaptive Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting: A Temporal Slice Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: advanced normalization strategies*\n\n*Zhiding Liu, Mingyue Cheng, Zhi Li, Zhenya Huang, Qi Liu, Yanhu Xie, Enhong Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel slice-level adaptive normalization scheme, referred to SAN, is proposed, which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization and could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning models have progressively advanced time series forecasting due to their powerful capacity in capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to make accurate predictions due to the existence of non-stationarity in real-world data, denoting the data distribution rapidly changes over time. To mitigate such a dilemma, several efforts have been conducted by reducing the non-stationarity with normalization operation. However, these methods typically overlook the distribution discrepancy between the input series and the horizon series, and assume that all time points within the same instance share the same statistical properties, which is too ideal and may lead to suboptimal relative improvements. To this end, we propose a novel slice-level adaptive normalization, referred to SAN , which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization. SAN includes two crucial designs. First, SAN tries to eliminate the non-stationarity of time series in units of a local temporal slice (i.e., sub-series) rather than a global instance. Second, SAN employs a slight network module to independently model the evolving trends of statistical properties of raw time series. Consequently, SAN could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data. We instantiate the proposed SAN on four widely used forecasting models and test their prediction results on benchmark datasets to evaluate its effectiveness. Also, we report some insightful findings to deeply analyze and understand our proposed SAN.

TTN: A Domain-Shift Aware Batch Normalization in Test-Time Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: advanced normalization strategies*\n\n*Hyesu Lim, Byeonggeun Kim, J. Choo, Sungha Choi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new test-time normalization (TTN) method that interpolates the statistics by adjusting the importance between CBN and TBN according to the domain-shift sensitivity of each BN layer is presented and improves model robustness to shifted domains across a wide range of batch sizes and in various realistic evaluation scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a novel batch normalization strategy for test-time adaptation. Recent test-time adaptation methods heavily rely on the modified batch normalization, i.e., transductive batch normalization (TBN), which calculates the mean and the variance from the current test batch rather than using the running mean and variance obtained from the source data, i.e., conventional batch normalization (CBN). Adopting TBN that employs test batch statistics mitigates the performance degradation caused by the domain shift. However, re-estimating normalization statistics using test data depends on impractical assumptions that a test batch should be large enough and be drawn from i.i.d. stream, and we observed that the previous methods with TBN show critical performance drop without the assumptions. In this paper, we identify that CBN and TBN are in a trade-off relationship and present a new test-time normalization (TTN) method that interpolates the statistics by adjusting the importance between CBN and TBN according to the domain-shift sensitivity of each BN layer. Our proposed TTN improves model robustness to shifted domains across a wide range of batch sizes and in various realistic evaluation scenarios. TTN is widely applicable to other test-time adaptation methods that rely on updating model parameters via backpropagation. We demonstrate that adopting TTN further improves their performance and achieves state-of-the-art performance in various standard benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 68  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Despite its successful usage in GANs, the mechanism of its validity is still unclear. In this paper, we propose a geometric framework to theoretically analyze the role of noise injection in GANs. Based on Riemannian geometry, we successfully model the noise injection framework as fuzzy equivalence on the geodesic normal coordinates. Guided by our theories, we find that the existing method is incomplete and a new strategy for noise injection is devised.

FiTv2: Scalable and Improved Flexible Vision Transformer for Diffusion Model\n\n*From Search Query: advanced normalization strategies*\n\n*and Lei Bai, Wanli Ouyang, Cai Zhou, Di Huang, Zeyu Lu, Zidong Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** \\textit{Nature is infinitely resolution-free}. In the context of this reality, existing diffusion models, such as Diffusion Transformers, often face challenges when processing image resolutions outside of their trained domain. To address this limitation, we conceptualize images as sequences of tokens with dynamic sizes, rather than traditional methods that perceive images as fixed-resolution grids. This perspective enables a flexible training strategy that seamlessly accommodates various aspect ratios during both training and inference, thus promoting resolution generalization and eliminating biases introduced by image cropping. On this basis, we present the \\textbf{Flexible Vision Transformer} (FiT), a transformer architecture specifically designed for generating images with \\textit{unrestricted resolutions and aspect ratios}. We further upgrade the FiT to FiTv2 with several innovative designs, includingthe Query-Key vector normalization, the AdaLN-LoRA module, a rectified flow scheduler, and a Logit-Normal sampler. Enhanced by a meticulously adjusted network structure, FiTv2 exhibits $2\\times$ convergence speed of FiT. When incorporating advanced training-free extrapolation techniques, FiTv2 demonstrates remarkable adaptability in both resolution extrapolation and diverse resolution generation. Additionally, our exploration of the scalability of the FiTv2 model reveals that larger models exhibit better computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient post-training strategy to adapt a pre-trained model for the high-resolution generation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the exceptional performance of FiTv2 across a broad range of resolutions. We have released all the codes and models at \\url{https://github.com/whlzy/FiT} to promote the exploration of diffusion transformer models for arbitrary-resolution image generation.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-17\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher enhance the performance, efficiency, and scalability of Generalized Autoregressive Units (GAUs) in language models using gated adaptive normalization and advanced dynamic RMSNorm strategies, here are the key insights and references that are most relevant:\n\n### **Gated Adaptive Normalization**\n\n1. **Gated Linear Unit (GLU) and Adaptive Normalization:**\n   - The paper on \"Rodimus: Efficient Language Models via Gated Linear Units\" discusses the use of GLUs, which merge into a Gated Linear Unit, allowing simultaneous token and channel mixing.

This synergy can enhance the GAU's contextual understanding, as seen in models that integrate graph-inspired attention mechanisms.\n\n2. **Normalization Placement and Architectural Optimization:**\n   - The placement of normalization layers significantly affects model performance. Adaptive normalization can mitigate issues associated with placement, offering flexibility in architectural design. For example, \"LaPE\" employs independent LayerNorms for token embeddings and position embeddings, resulting in layer-adaptive and hierarchical position embeddings.\n\n3. **Hardware Optimization:**\n   - Ensuring that adaptive normalization techniques are optimized for parallel processing and hardware acceleration is crucial.

This adaptability leads to improved perplexity and accuracy in language modeling tasks.\n  - **Computational Efficiency:** RMSNorm's simplified computation compared to LayerNorm can be further optimized with adaptive mechanisms, maintaining the balance between flexibility and efficiency essential for scaling GAUs in larger models and longer sequences.\n  - **Training Stability:** Integrating dynamic RMSNorm can enhance training stability by preventing gradient explosions and ensuring consistent normalization across varying input magnitudes. This is crucial in deep GAU stacks where normalization layers play a pivotal role in maintaining stable gradients.\n  - **Flexibility in Model Architectures:** Adaptive RMSNorm can be seamlessly integrated into existing GAU architectures without necessitating significant architectural changes. Its compatibility with other components like gating mechanisms and graph convolutions allows for comprehensive enhancements to GAUs.\n\n- **Alternative Normalization Techniques:**\n  - **Dynamic LayerNorm (DTN):** Extends normalization by considering both intra-token and inter-token dependencies, allowing the model to recalibrate features dynamically. This dual approach can enhance the model's ability to focus on relevant features and maintain robustness across varied inputs.\n  - **Compressed RMSNorm (CRMSNorm):** Introduces lossless compression of normalization parameters, reducing memory overhead without compromising performance. This technique is beneficial for deploying GAUs in resource-constrained environments.\n  - **Progressive Re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN):** Replaces LayerNorm with BatchNorm during training, achieving similar performance with reduced computational costs. This strategy can be adapted for GAUs to enhance normalization efficiency.\n\n- **Integration Strategies:**\n  - **Gating Mechanisms:** Combining gating mechanisms with adaptive normalization layers enables GAUs to control the flow of information based on dynamic scaling, leading to more expressive and efficient models. For instance, Gated RMSNorm can selectively emphasize or de-emphasize certain features, enhancing model adaptability and robustness.\n  - **Graph-Convolutions:** Incorporating graph convolutions alongside adaptive normalization can capture complex relational dependencies between tokens, further enhancing the GAU's contextual understanding. This synergy can lead to improved performance in tasks requiring nuanced language comprehension and generation.\n  - **Normalization Placement:** Positioning normalization layers before or after residual connections (PreNorm vs. PostNorm) significantly affects GAU performance. Adaptive normalization can mitigate issues associated with placement, offering flexibility in architectural design and potentially leading to better generalization and efficiency.\n\n- **Implementation Considerations:**\n  - **Hardware Optimization:** To maintain computational efficiency, adaptive normalization techniques should be optimized for parallel processing and hardware acceleration. Techniques like asynchronous parallel linear operations and efficient memory management are essential to leverage the full potential of adaptive RMSNorm within GAUs.\n  - **Gradient Stability:** Ensuring that dynamic normalization does not introduce gradient instability is crucial. Techniques like gradient clipping, careful initialization, and normalized parameter updates can aid in maintaining stable training dynamics, especially when integrating complex normalization mechanisms.\n  - **Scalability:** Adaptive normalization must scale efficiently with model size and sequence length. Leveraging structured computations, efficient memory access patterns, and minimizing additional computational overhead are key to facilitating the scaling of GAUs with enhanced normalization.\n\n- **Empirical Evidence and Case Studies:**\n  - **Performance Improvements:** Internal sources indicate that replacing LayerNorm with RMSNorm or using adaptive normalization techniques can lead to modest performance improvements and better convergence rates. External sources, such as U-GAT-IT and LaPE, demonstrate that adaptive normalization methods significantly enhance model performance across various tasks.\n  - **Normalization Placement Impact:** Research shows that the placement and configuration of normalization layers substantially impact model performance, with adaptive strategies offering improved generalization and efficiency. For example, Pre-RMSNorm and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformers establish the equivalence of various normalization approaches, providing flexibility in architectural design without compromising functionality.\n  - **Gated Mechanisms and Adaptive Normalization:** Combining gating mechanisms with adaptive normalization, as seen in ReLA and other works, enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant features and maintain expressiveness. This combination is particularly effective in tasks requiring high adaptability and robustness, such as image-to-image translation and dynamic scene generation.\n\n#### **4.

Position Coupling: Leveraging Task Structure for Improved Length Generalization of Transformers (Avg.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers (Ring Attention), which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/23 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 2023.

Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.90)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency.

Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 43/97 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\nArXiv, 2312.10523, 2023.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

Query-Efficient and Scalable Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on Discrete Sequential Data via Bayesian Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: \"Optimization Techniques for Efficient Dynamic Normalization\"*\n\n*Deokjae Lee, Seungyong Moon, Junhyeok Lee, Hyun Oh Song*\n\n**TL;DR:** A query-efficient black-box attack using Bayesian optimization, which dynamically computes important positions using an automatic relevance determination (ARD) categorical kernel is proposed, and a post-optimization algorithm is developed that finds adversarial examples with smaller perturbation size.\n\n**Abstract:** We focus on the problem of adversarial attacks against models on discrete sequential data in the black-box setting where the attacker aims to craft adversarial examples with limited query access to the victim model. Existing black-box attacks, mostly based on greedy algorithms, find adversarial examples using pre-computed key positions to perturb, which severely limits the search space and might result in suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose a query-efficient black-box attack using Bayesian optimization, which dynamically computes important positions using an automatic relevance determination (ARD) categorical kernel. We introduce block decomposition and history subsampling techniques to improve the scalability of Bayesian optimization when an input sequence becomes long. Moreover, we develop a post-optimization algorithm that finds adversarial examples with smaller perturbation size. Experiments on natural language and protein classification tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves higher attack success rate with significant reduction in query count and modification rate compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2.

The great success of DNNs motivates the pursuing of lightweight models for the deployment onto embedded devices. However, most of the previous studies optimize for inference while neglect training or even complicate it. Training is far more intractable, since (i) the neurons dominate the memory cost rather than the weights in inference; (ii) the dynamic activation makes previous sparse acceleration via one-off optimization on fixed weight invalid; (iii) batch normalization (BN) is critical for maintaining accuracy while its activation reorganization damages the sparsity. To address these issues, DSG activates only a small amount of neurons with high selectivity at each iteration via a dimension-reduction search (DRS) and obtains the BN compatibility via a double-mask selection (DMS). Experiments show significant memory saving (1.7-4.5x) and operation reduction (2.3-4.4x) with little accuracy loss on various benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 3. Efficient Methods for Non-stationary Online Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"Optimization Techniques for Efficient Dynamic Normalization\"*\n\n*Peng Zhao, Yan-Feng Xie, Lijun Zhang, Zhi-Hua Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** Efficient methods for optimizing dynamic regret and adaptive regret are presented, which reduce the number of projections per round from $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ to $1$.\n\n**Abstract:** Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years. In particular, dynamic regret and adaptive regret are proposed as two principled performance measures for online convex optimization in non-stationary environments. To optimize them, a two-layer online ensemble is usually deployed due to the inherent uncertainty of the non-stationarity, in which a group of base-learners are maintained and a meta-algorithm is employed to track the best one on the fly. However, the two-layer structure raises the concern about the computational complexity -- those methods typically maintain $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ base-learners simultaneously for a $T$-round online game and thus perform multiple projections onto the feasible domain per round, which becomes the computational bottleneck when the domain is complicated. In this paper, we present efficient methods for optimizing dynamic regret and adaptive regret, which reduce the number of projections per round from $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ to $1$. Moreover, our obtained algorithms require only one gradient query and one function evaluation at each round. Our technique hinges on the reduction mechanism developed in parameter-free online learning and requires non-trivial twists on non-stationary online methods.

Moreover, using these approaches, chip area for logics handling irregular sparse data access can be saved.

Kusch, Gianluca Ceruti, Francesco Tudisco*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks that are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks have achieved tremendous success in a large variety of applications. However, their memory footprint and computational demand can render them impractical in application settings with limited hardware or energy resources. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks. Remarkably, these subnetworks are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced. The main idea is to restrict the weight matrices to a low-rank manifold and to update the low-rank factors rather than the full matrix during training. To derive training updates that are restricted to the prescribed manifold, we employ techniques from dynamic model order reduction for matrix differential equations. This allows us to provide approximation, stability, and descent guarantees. Moreover, our method automatically and dynamically adapts the ranks during training to achieve the desired approximation accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through a variety of numerical experiments on fully-connected and convolutional networks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Recently, deep SNNs have shown breathtaking performance improvement through cutting-edge training strategy and \ufb02exi-ble structure, which also scales up the number of parameters and computational burdens in a single network. Inspired by the state transition of dendritic spines in the \ufb01lopodial model of spinogen-esis, we model different states of SNN weights, facilitating weight optimization for pruning. Furthermore, the pruning speed can be regulated by using different functions describing the growing threshold of state transition. We organize these techniques as a dynamic pruning algorithm based on nonlinear reparameterization mapping from spine size to SNN weights. Our approach yields sparse deep networks on the large-scale dataset (SEW ResNet18 on ImageNet) while maintaining state-of-the-art low performance loss ( \u223c 3% at 88.8% sparsity) compared to existing pruning methods on directly trained SNNs.

Widening the Representation Bottleneck in Neural Machine Translation\n  with Lexical Shortcuts\n\n*From Search Query: \"Integration of Dynamic Layer Normalization and Gating Mechanisms\"*\n\n*Denis Emelin, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer is a state-of-the-art neural translation model that uses\nattention to iteratively refine lexical representations with information drawn\nfrom the surrounding context. Lexical features are fed into the first layer and\npropagated through a deep network of hidden layers. We argue that the need to\nrepresent and propagate lexical features in each layer limits the model's\ncapacity for learning and representing other information relevant to the task.\nTo alleviate this bottleneck, we introduce gated shortcut connections between\nthe embedding layer and each subsequent layer within the encoder and decoder.\nThis enables the model to access relevant lexical content dynamically, without\nexpending limited resources on storing it within intermediate states. We show\nthat the proposed modification yields consistent improvements over a baseline\ntransformer on standard WMT translation tasks in 5 translation directions (0.9\nBLEU on average) and reduces the amount of lexical information passed along the\nhidden layers. We furthermore evaluate different ways to integrate lexical\nconnections into the transformer architecture and present ablation experiments\nexploring the effect of proposed shortcuts on model behavior.\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-28T16:14:06Z  (*Updated: 2019-06-28T16:14:06Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

AdaLomo: Low-memory Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate\n\n*From Search Query: \"Empirical Results of Dynamic Adaptive Normalization in Language Models\"*\n\n*Kai Lv, Hang Yan, Qipeng Guo, Haijun Lv, Xipeng Qiu*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have achieved remarkable success, but their extensive\nparameter size necessitates substantial memory for training, thereby setting a\nhigh threshold. While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO)\nreduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic\ngradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal\nconvergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for\nlarge language models, AdamW. Through empirical analysis of the Adam optimizer,\nwe found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more\ncritical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the\nlow-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an\nadaptive learning rate for each parameter. To maintain memory efficiency, we\nemploy non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation\nin the optimizer state.

Improving and generalizing flow-based generative models with minibatch optimal transport\n\n*From Search Query: \"Optimization Techniques for Efficient Dynamic Normalization\"*\n\n*Yanlei Zhang, Kilian Fatras, Yoshua Bengio, Guy Wolf, Jarrid Rector-Brooks, Guillaume Huguet, Nikolay Malkin, Alexander Tong*\n\n**Abstract:** Continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) are an attractive generative modeling technique, but they have been held back by limitations in their simulation-based maximum likelihood training. We introduce the generalized conditional flow matching (CFM) technique, a family of simulation-free training objectives for CNFs. CFM features a stable regression objective like that used to train the stochastic flow in diffusion models but enjoys the efficient inference of deterministic flow models. In contrast to both diffusion models and prior CNF training algorithms, CFM does not require the source distribution to be Gaussian or require evaluation of its density. A variant of our objective is optimal transport CFM (OT-CFM), which creates simpler flows that are more stable to train and lead to faster inference, as evaluated in our experiments. Furthermore, we show that when the true OT plan is available, our OT-CFM method approximates dynamic OT. Training CNFs with CFM improves results on a variety of conditional and unconditional generation tasks, such as inferring single cell dynamics, unsupervised image translation, and Schr\\\"odinger bridge inference.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. Koopman-Based Surrogate Modelling of Turbulent Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard Convection\n\n*From Search Query: \"Optimization Techniques for Efficient Dynamic Normalization\"*\n\n*Barbara Hammer, Michiel Straat, Thorben Markmann*\n\n**Abstract:** Several related works have introduced Koopman-based Machine Learning architectures as a surrogate model for dynamical systems. These architectures aim to learn non-linear measurements (also known as observables) of the system's state that evolve by a linear operator and are, therefore, amenable to model-based linear control techniques. So far, mainly simple systems have been targeted, and Koopman architectures as reduced-order models for more complex dynamics have not been fully explored. Hence, we use a Koopman-inspired architecture called the Linear Recurrent Autoencoder Network (LRAN) for learning reduced-order dynamics in convection flows of a Rayleigh B\\'enard Convection (RBC) system at different amounts of turbulence. The data is obtained from direct numerical simulations of the RBC system. A traditional fluid dynamics method, the Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition (KDMD), is used to compare the LRAN. For both methods, we performed hyperparameter sweeps to identify optimal settings. We used a Normalized Sum of Square Error measure for the quantitative evaluation of the models, and we also studied the model predictions qualitatively. We obtained more accurate predictions with the LRAN than with KDMD in the most turbulent setting. We conjecture that this is due to the LRAN's flexibility in learning complicated observables from data, thereby serving as a viable surrogate model for the main structure of fluid dynamics in turbulent convection settings. In contrast, KDMD was more effective in lower turbulence settings due to the repetitiveness of the convection flow. The feasibility of Koopman-based surrogate models for turbulent fluid flows opens possibilities for efficient model-based control techniques useful in a variety of industrial settings.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-10\n\n\n\n#### 3. Structured Pruning for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks: A survey\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hardware Acceleration for Dynamic Neural Networks\"*\n\n*Lingao Xiao, Yang He*\n\n**Abstract:** The remarkable performance of deep Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is generally attributed to their deeper and wider architectures, which can come with significant computational costs. Pruning neural networks has thus gained interest since it effectively lowers storage and computational costs. In contrast to weight pruning, which results in unstructured models, structured pruning provides the benefit of realistic acceleration by producing models that are friendly to hardware implementation. The special requirements of structured pruning have led to the discovery of numerous new challenges and the development of innovative solutions. This article surveys the recent progress towards structured pruning of deep CNNs. We summarize and compare the state-of-the-art structured pruning techniques with respect to filter ranking methods, regularization methods, dynamic execution, neural architecture search, the lottery ticket hypothesis, and the applications of pruning. While discussing structured pruning algorithms, we briefly introduce the unstructured pruning counterpart to emphasize their differences. Furthermore, we provide insights into potential research opportunities in the field of structured pruning.

NeuralSim: Augmenting Differentiable Simulators with Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hardware Acceleration for Dynamic Neural Networks\"*\n\n*Gaurav S. Sukhatme, Yizhou Sheng, Erwin Coumans, David Millard, Eric Heiden*\n\n**Abstract:** Differentiable simulators provide an avenue for closing the sim-to-real gap by enabling the use of efficient, gradient-based optimization algorithms to find the simulation parameters that best fit the observed sensor readings. Nonetheless, these analytical models can only predict the dynamical behavior of systems for which they have been designed. In this work, we study the augmentation of a novel differentiable rigid-body physics engine via neural networks that is able to learn nonlinear relationships between dynamic quantities and can thus learn effects not accounted for in traditional simulators.Such augmentations require less data to train and generalize better compared to entirely data-driven models. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the ability of our hybrid simulator to learn complex dynamics involving frictional contacts from real data, as well as match known models of viscous friction, and present an approach for automatically discovering useful augmentations. We show that, besides benefiting dynamics modeling, inserting neural networks can accelerate model-based control architectures. We observe a ten-fold speed-up when replacing the QP solver inside a model-predictive gait controller for quadruped robots with a neural network, allowing us to significantly improve control delays as we demonstrate in real-hardware experiments.

On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models (Avg.

The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/29 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 0.73)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

Originally designed for continuous signals, SSMs have shown superior performance on a plethora of tasks, in vision and audio; however, SSMs still lag Transformer performance in Language Modeling tasks. In this work, we propose a hybrid layer named Block-State Transformer (BST), that internally combines an SSM sublayer for long-range contextualization, and a Block Transformer sublayer for short-term representation of sequences. We study three different, and completely parallelizable, variants that integrate SSMs and block-wise attention. We show that our model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language modeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences. In addition, the Block-State Transformer demonstrates more than tenfold increase in speed at the layer level compared to the Block-Recurrent Transformer when model parallelization is employed.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/28 (Score: 0.60)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/1805.04623, 2018.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/27 (Score: 0.58)*\n\n```\nHinton. 2016.

Real-time Photorealistic Dynamic Scene Representation and Rendering with 4D Gaussian Splatting\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic RMSNorm\"*\n\n*Zeyu Yang, Hongye Yang, Zijie Pan, Xiatian Zhu, Li Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work considers the spacetime as an entirety and proposes to approximate the underlying spatio-temporal 4D volume of a dynamic scene by optimizing a collection of 4D primitives, with explicit geometry and appearance modeling, making it suitable for capturing complex dynamic scene motions.\n\n**Abstract:** Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from 2D images and generating diverse views over time is challenging due to scene complexity and temporal dynamics. Despite advancements in neural implicit models, limitations persist: (i) Inadequate Scene Structure: Existing methods struggle to reveal the spatial and temporal structure of dynamic scenes from directly learning the complex 6D plenoptic function. (ii) Scaling Deformation Modeling: Explicitly modeling scene element deformation becomes impractical for complex dynamics. To address these issues, we consider the spacetime as an entirety and propose to approximate the underlying spatio-temporal 4D volume of a dynamic scene by optimizing a collection of 4D primitives, with explicit geometry and appearance modeling. Learning to optimize the 4D primitives enables us to synthesize novel views at any desired time with our tailored rendering routine. Our model is conceptually simple, consisting of a 4D Gaussian parameterized by anisotropic ellipses that can rotate arbitrarily in space and time, as well as view-dependent and time-evolved appearance represented by the coefficient of 4D spherindrical harmonics. This approach offers simplicity, flexibility for variable-length video and end-to-end training, and efficient real-time rendering, making it suitable for capturing complex dynamic scene motions. Experiments across various benchmarks, including monocular and multi-view scenarios, demonstrate our 4DGS model's superior visual quality and efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 133  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 2.

Our approach uses a 4D dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which is optimized for scene appearance, density, and motion consistency by querying a Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion-based model. The dynamic video output generated from the provided text can be viewed from any camera location and angle, and can be composited into any 3D environment. MAV3D does not require any 3D or 4D data and the T2V model is trained only on Text-Image pairs and unlabeled videos. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments and show an improvement over previously established internal baselines.

Pre-RMSNorm and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformers: Equivalent and Efficient Pre-LN Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic RMSNorm\"*\n\n*Zixuan Jiang, Jiaqi Gu, Hanqing Zhu, D. Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference is formally established, implying that Pre- LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved great success in machine learning applications. Normalization techniques, such as Layer Normalization (LayerNorm, LN) and Root Mean Square Normalization (RMSNorm), play a critical role in accelerating and stabilizing the training of Transformers. While LayerNorm recenters and rescales input vectors, RMSNorm only rescales the vectors by their RMS value. Despite being more computationally efficient, RMSNorm may compromise the representation ability of Transformers. There is currently no consensus regarding the preferred normalization technique, as some models employ LayerNorm while others utilize RMSNorm, especially in recent large language models. It is challenging to convert Transformers with one normalization to the other type. While there is an ongoing disagreement between the two normalization types, we propose a solution to unify two mainstream Transformer architectures, Pre-LN and Pre-RMSNorm Transformers. By removing the inherent redundant mean information in the main branch of Pre-LN Transformers, we can reduce LayerNorm to RMSNorm, achieving higher efficiency. We further propose the Compressed RMSNorm (CRMSNorm) and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer based on a lossless compression of the zero-mean vectors. We formally establish the equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference. It implies that Pre-LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSNorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement. Experiments demonstrate that we can reduce the training and inference time of Pre-LN Transformers by 1% - 10%.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Different from the conventional KV cache that retains key and value vectors for all context tokens, we conduct targeted profiling to discern the intrinsic structure of attention modules. Based on the recognized structure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding non-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only employing the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all tokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the construction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without resource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across various asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss.

In this paper, we improve upon recent analysis of Transformers and formalize a notion of sensitivity to capture the difficulty of training. Sensitivity characterizes how the variance of activation and gradient norms change in expectation when parameters are randomly perturbed. We analyze the sensitivity of previous Transformer architectures and design a new architecture, the Catformer, which replaces residual connections or RNN-based gating mechanisms with concatenation. We prove that Catformers are less sensitive than other Transformer variants and demonstrate that this leads to more stable training.

Quantizable Transformers: Removing Outliers by Helping Attention Heads Do Nothing\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gating Mechanisms in Transformers\"*\n\n*Yelysei Bondarenko, Markus Nagel, Tijmen Blankevoort*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is empirically show that models pre-trained using the proposed methods learn significantly smaller outliers while maintaining and sometimes even improving the floating-point task performance, which enables us to quantize transformers to full INT8 quantization of the activations without any additional effort.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models have been widely adopted in various domains over the last years, and especially large language models have advanced the field of AI significantly. Due to their size, the capability of these networks has increased tremendously, but this has come at the cost of a significant increase in necessary compute. Quantization is one of the most effective ways to reduce the computational time and memory consumption of neural networks. Many studies have shown, however, that modern transformer models tend to learn strong outliers in their activations, making them difficult to quantize. To retain acceptable performance, the existence of these outliers requires activations to be in higher bitwidth or the use of different numeric formats, extra fine-tuning, or other workarounds. We show that strong outliers are related to very specific behavior of attention heads that try to learn a\"no-op\"or just a partial update of the residual. To achieve the exact zeros needed in the attention matrix for a no-update, the input to the softmax is pushed to be larger and larger during training, causing outliers in other parts of the network. Based on these observations, we propose two simple (independent) modifications to the attention mechanism - clipped softmax and gated attention. We empirically show that models pre-trained using our methods learn significantly smaller outliers while maintaining and sometimes even improving the floating-point task performance. This enables us to quantize transformers to full INT8 quantization of the activations without any additional effort. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on both language models (BERT, OPT) and vision transformers.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 61  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n### 5 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Root Mean Square Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic RMSNorm\"*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) has been successfully applied to various deep\nneural networks to help stabilize training and boost model convergence because\nof its capability in handling re-centering and re-scaling of both inputs and\nweight matrix. However, the computational overhead introduced by LayerNorm\nmakes these improvements expensive and significantly slows the underlying\nnetwork, e.g. RNN in particular. In this paper, we hypothesize that\nre-centering invariance in LayerNorm is dispensable and propose root mean\nsquare layer normalization, or RMSNorm. RMSNorm regularizes the summed inputs\nto a neuron in one layer according to root mean square (RMS), giving the model\nre-scaling invariance property and implicit learning rate adaptation ability.\nRMSNorm is computationally simpler and thus more efficient than LayerNorm. We\nalso present partial RMSNorm, or pRMSNorm where the RMS is estimated from p% of\nthe summed inputs without breaking the above properties. Extensive experiments\non several tasks using diverse network architectures show that RMSNorm achieves\ncomparable performance against LayerNorm but reduces the running time by 7%~64%\non different models.

I-LLM: Efficient Integer-Only Inference for Fully-Quantized Low-Bit\n  Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic RMSNorm\"*\n\n*Xing Hu, Yuan Cheng, Dawei Yang, Zhihang Yuan, Jiangyong Yu, Chen Xu, Sifan Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Post-training quantization (PTQ) serves as a potent technique to accelerate\nthe inference of large language models (LLMs). Nonetheless, existing works\nstill necessitate a considerable number of floating-point (FP) operations\nduring inference, including additional quantization and de-quantization, as\nwell as non-linear operators such as RMSNorm and Softmax. This limitation\nhinders the deployment of LLMs on the edge and cloud devices. In this paper, we\nidentify the primary obstacle to integer-only quantization for LLMs lies in the\nlarge fluctuation of activations across channels and tokens in both linear and\nnon-linear operations. To address this issue, we propose I-LLM, a novel\ninteger-only fully-quantized PTQ framework tailored for LLMs. Specifically, (1)\nwe develop Fully-Smooth Block-Reconstruction (FSBR) to aggressively smooth\ninter-channel variations of all activations and weights. (2) to alleviate\ndegradation caused by inter-token variations, we introduce a novel approach\ncalled Dynamic Integer-only MatMul (DI-MatMul). This method enables dynamic\nquantization in full-integer matrix multiplication by dynamically quantizing\nthe input and outputs with integer-only operations. (3) we design\nDI-ClippedSoftmax, DI-Exp, and DI-Normalization, which utilize bit shift to\nexecute non-linear operators efficiently while maintaining accuracy. The\nexperiment shows that our I-LLM achieves comparable accuracy to the FP baseline\nand outperforms non-integer quantization methods. For example, I-LLM can\noperate at W4A4 with negligible loss of accuracy. To our knowledge, we are the\nfirst to bridge the gap between integer-only quantization and LLMs. We've\npublished our code on anonymous.4open.science, aiming to contribute to the\nadvancement of this field.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-28T05:56:11Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-05T15:26:58Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Re-Introducing LayerNorm: Geometric Meaning, Irreversibility and a\n  Comparative Study with RMSNorm\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive RMSNorm\"*\n\n*Akshat Gupta, Atahan Ozdemir, Gopala Anumanchipalli*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization is a pivotal step in the transformer architecture. This\npaper delves into the less explored geometric implications of this process,\nexamining how LayerNorm influences the norm and orientation of hidden vectors\nin the representation space. We show that the definition of LayerNorm is\ninnately linked to the uniform vector, defined as $\\boldsymbol{1} = [1, 1, 1,\n1, \\cdots, 1]^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. We then show that the standardization step\nin LayerNorm can be understood in three simple steps: (i) remove the component\nof a vector along the uniform vector, (ii) normalize the remaining vector, and\n(iii) scale the resultant vector by $\\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimensionality\nof the representation space. We also introduce the property of\n\"irreversibility\" for LayerNorm, where we show that the information lost during\nthe normalization process cannot be recovered. In other words, unlike batch\nnormalization, LayerNorm cannot learn an identity transform. While we present\npossible arguments for removing the component along the uniform vector, the\nchoice of removing this component seems arbitrary and not well motivated by the\noriginal authors. To evaluate the usefulness of this step, we compare the\nhidden representations of LayerNorm-based LLMs with models trained using\nRMSNorm and show that all LLMs naturally align representations orthogonal to\nthe uniform vector, presenting the first mechanistic evidence that removing the\ncomponent along the uniform vector in LayerNorm is a redundant step. Our\nfindings support the use of RMSNorm over LayerNorm as it is not only more\ncomputationally efficient with comparable downstream performance, but also\nlearns a similar distribution of hidden representations that operate orthogonal\nto the uniform vector.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-19T17:58:07Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-19T17:58:07Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4.

Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gating Mechanisms in Transformers\"*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have surpassed RNNs in popularity due to their superior\nabilities in parallel training and long-term dependency modeling. Recently,\nthere has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence\nmodeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the\nlinear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates\nwithin the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model\ndubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes\nforget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound\nincreases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to\nmodel long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local,\nshort-term dependencies.

In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Sparse Mixer slightly outperforms (<1%) BERT on GLUE and SuperGLUE, but more importantly trains 65% faster and runs inference 61% faster. We also present a faster variant, prosaically named Fast Sparse Mixer, that marginally underperforms BERT on SuperGLUE, but trains and runs nearly twice as fast. We justify the design of these two models by carefully ablating through various mixing mechanisms, MoE configurations and hyperparameters. Sparse Mixer overcomes many of the latency and stability concerns of MoE models and offers the prospect of serving sparse student models, without resorting to distilling them to dense variants.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-24\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block, such as the **DynGatTTT** proposal, here are the key areas and specific information that need to be focused on:\n\n### Dynamic Adaptive RMSNorm\n\n#### Existing Research\n- **Search for Studies**: Look for papers and technical documents that introduce dynamic or adaptive versions of RMSNorm or similar normalization techniques in neural network architectures.

Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.41)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.41)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Their success hinges on the fact that the underlying physical phenomena are continuous. For inherently discrete and categorical data such as language, various diffusion-inspired alternatives have been proposed. However, the continuous nature of diffusion models conveys many benefits, and in this work we endeavour to preserve it. We propose CDCD, a framework for modelling categorical data with diffusion models that are continuous both in time and input space. We demonstrate its efficacy on several language modelling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 72/76 (Score: 0.39)*\n\n```\nWei, and Z. Sui.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/32 (Score: 0.39)*\n\n```\nInternational Conference on Learning Representations, 2019. $\\left[\\mathrm{LKV}^{+}\\right.$18] Drew Linsley, Junkyung Kim, Vijay Veerabadran, Charles Windolf, and Thomas Serre.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.36)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/24 (Score: 0.26)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1711.05101, 2017.

DOROTHIE: Spoken Dialogue for Handling Unexpected Situations in Interactive Autonomous Driving Agents\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic RMSNorm in Language Models\"*\n\n*Ziqiao Ma, B. VanDerPloeg, Cristian-Paul Bara, Yidong Huang, Eui-In Kim, Felix Gervits, M. Marge, J. Chai*\n\n**TL;DR:** Dialogue On the ROad To Handle Irregular Events (DOROTHIE) is introduced, a novel interactive simulation platform that enables the creation of unexpected situations on the fly to support empirical studies on situated communication with autonomous driving agents and a transformer-based baseline model is developed.\n\n**Abstract:** In the real world, autonomous driving agents navigate in highly dynamic environments full of unexpected situations where pre-trained models are unreliable. In these situations, what is immediately available to vehicles is often only human operators. Empowering autonomous driving agents with the ability to navigate in a continuous and dynamic environment and to communicate with humans through sensorimotor-grounded dialogue becomes critical. To this end, we introduce Dialogue On the ROad To Handle Irregular Events (DOROTHIE), a novel interactive simulation platform that enables the creation of unexpected situations on the fly to support empirical studies on situated communication with autonomous driving agents. Based on this platform, we created the Situated Dialogue Navigation (SDN), a navigation benchmark of 183 trials with a total of 8415 utterances, around 18.7 hours of control streams, and 2.9 hours of trimmed audio. SDN is developed to evaluate the agent's ability to predict dialogue moves from humans as well as generate its own dialogue moves and physical navigation actions. We further developed a transformer-based baseline model for these SDN tasks. Our empirical results indicate that language guided-navigation in a highly dynamic environment is an extremely difficult task for end-to-end models. These results will provide insight towards future work on robust autonomous driving agents. The DOROTHIE platform, SDN benchmark, and code for the baseline model are available at https://github.com/sled-group/DOROTHIE.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Long-Short Transformer: Efficient Transformers for Language and Vision\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Normalization in Transformers\"*\n\n*Chen Zhu, Wei Ping, Chaowei Xiao, Mohammad Shoeybi, T. Goldstein, Anima Anandkumar, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks, and proposes a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains. However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

NDH-Full: Learning and Evaluating Navigational Agents on Full-Length Dialogue\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Normalization in Transformers\"*\n\n*Hyounghun Kim, Jialu Li, Mohit Bansal*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper explores the Navigation from Dialogue History (NDH) task, presents a state-of-the-art model which is built upon Vision-Language transformers, and proposes a new task setup called NDH-Full which takes the full dialogue and the whole navigation path as one instance.\n\n**Abstract:** Communication between human and mobile agents is getting increasingly important as such agents are widely deployed in our daily lives. Vision-and-Dialogue Navigation is one of the tasks that evaluate the agent\u2019s ability to interact with humans for assistance and navigate based on natural language responses. In this paper, we explore the Navigation from Dialogue History (NDH) task, which is based on the Cooperative Vision-and-Dialogue Navigation (CVDN) dataset, and present a state-of-the-art model which is built upon Vision-Language transformers. However, despite achieving competitive performance, we find that the agent in the NDH task is not evaluated appropriately by the primary metric \u2013 Goal Progress. By analyzing the performance mismatch between Goal Progress and other metrics (e.g., normalized Dynamic Time Warping) from our state-of-the-art model, we show that NDH\u2019s sub-path based task setup (i.e., navigating partial trajectory based on its correspondent subset of the full dialogue) does not provide the agent with enough supervision signal towards the goal region. Therefore, we propose a new task setup called NDH-Full which takes the full dialogue and the whole navigation path as one instance. We present a strong baseline model and show initial results on this new task. We further describe several approaches that we try, in order to improve the model performance (based on curriculum learning, pre-training, and data-augmentation), suggesting potential useful training methods on this new NDH-Full task.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Root Mean Square Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic RMSNorm in Language Models\"*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) has been successfully applied to various deep\nneural networks to help stabilize training and boost model convergence because\nof its capability in handling re-centering and re-scaling of both inputs and\nweight matrix. However, the computational overhead introduced by LayerNorm\nmakes these improvements expensive and significantly slows the underlying\nnetwork, e.g. RNN in particular. In this paper, we hypothesize that\nre-centering invariance in LayerNorm is dispensable and propose root mean\nsquare layer normalization, or RMSNorm. RMSNorm regularizes the summed inputs\nto a neuron in one layer according to root mean square (RMS), giving the model\nre-scaling invariance property and implicit learning rate adaptation ability.\nRMSNorm is computationally simpler and thus more efficient than LayerNorm. We\nalso present partial RMSNorm, or pRMSNorm where the RMS is estimated from p% of\nthe summed inputs without breaking the above properties. Extensive experiments\non several tasks using diverse network architectures show that RMSNorm achieves\ncomparable performance against LayerNorm but reduces the running time by 7%~64%\non different models.

Re-Introducing LayerNorm: Geometric Meaning, Irreversibility and a\n  Comparative Study with RMSNorm\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic RMSNorm in Language Models\"*\n\n*Akshat Gupta, Atahan Ozdemir, Gopala Anumanchipalli*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization is a pivotal step in the transformer architecture. This\npaper delves into the less explored geometric implications of this process,\nexamining how LayerNorm influences the norm and orientation of hidden vectors\nin the representation space. We show that the definition of LayerNorm is\ninnately linked to the uniform vector, defined as $\\boldsymbol{1} = [1, 1, 1,\n1, \\cdots, 1]^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. We then show that the standardization step\nin LayerNorm can be understood in three simple steps: (i) remove the component\nof a vector along the uniform vector, (ii) normalize the remaining vector, and\n(iii) scale the resultant vector by $\\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimensionality\nof the representation space. We also introduce the property of\n\"irreversibility\" for LayerNorm, where we show that the information lost during\nthe normalization process cannot be recovered. In other words, unlike batch\nnormalization, LayerNorm cannot learn an identity transform. While we present\npossible arguments for removing the component along the uniform vector, the\nchoice of removing this component seems arbitrary and not well motivated by the\noriginal authors. To evaluate the usefulness of this step, we compare the\nhidden representations of LayerNorm-based LLMs with models trained using\nRMSNorm and show that all LLMs naturally align representations orthogonal to\nthe uniform vector, presenting the first mechanistic evidence that removing the\ncomponent along the uniform vector in LayerNorm is a redundant step. Our\nfindings support the use of RMSNorm over LayerNorm as it is not only more\ncomputationally efficient with comparable downstream performance, but also\nlearns a similar distribution of hidden representations that operate orthogonal\nto the uniform vector.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-19T17:58:07Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-19T17:58:07Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Advanced Gating Mechanisms in GAUs\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuohang Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, ChengXiang Zhai*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent hybrid models combining Linear State Space Models (SSMs) with\nself-attention mechanisms have demonstrated impressive results across a range\nof sequence modeling tasks. However, current approaches apply attention modules\nstatically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to\nsub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural\nnetworks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements\nin a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated\nsub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption of neural networks\nat both training and inference stages. To validate the effectiveness of SMA on\nsequence modeling, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which\nemploys SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the\nstate representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only\nconduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear\ninference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide\nsubstantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based\nmodels. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including long sequence\nmodeling, speech classification and language modeling, SeqBoat brings new\nstate-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity, and\nreveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse\nactivation patterns.

Clustering in pure-attention hardmax transformers and its role in\n  sentiment analysis\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Normalization in Transformers\"*\n\n*Albert Alcalde, Giovanni Fantuzzi, Enrique Zuazua*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are extremely successful machine learning models whose\nmathematical properties remain poorly understood. Here, we rigorously\ncharacterize the behavior of transformers with hardmax self-attention and\nnormalization sublayers as the number of layers tends to infinity. By viewing\nsuch transformers as discrete-time dynamical systems describing the evolution\nof points in a Euclidean space, and thanks to a geometric interpretation of the\nself-attention mechanism based on hyperplane separation, we show that the\ntransformer inputs asymptotically converge to a clustered equilibrium\ndetermined by special points called leaders. We then leverage this theoretical\nunderstanding to solve sentiment analysis problems from language processing\nusing a fully interpretable transformer model, which effectively captures\n`context' by clustering meaningless words around leader words carrying the most\nmeaning. Finally, we outline remaining challenges to bridge the gap between the\nmathematical analysis of transformers and their real-life implementation.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-26T16:13:35Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-26T16:13:35Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. PowerNorm: Rethinking Batch Normalization in Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Normalization in Transformers\"*\n\n*Sheng Shen, Zhewei Yao, Amir Gholami, Michael W. Mahoney, Kurt Keutzer*\n\n**Abstract:** The standard normalization method for neural network (NN) models used in\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is layer normalization (LN). This is\ndifferent than batch normalization (BN), which is widely-adopted in Computer\nVision. The preferred use of LN in NLP is principally due to the empirical\nobservation that a (naive/vanilla) use of BN leads to significant performance\ndegradation for NLP tasks; however, a thorough understanding of the underlying\nreasons for this is not always evident. In this paper, we perform a systematic\nstudy of NLP transformer models to understand why BN has a poor performance, as\ncompared to LN. We find that the statistics of NLP data across the batch\ndimension exhibit large fluctuations throughout training. This results in\ninstability, if BN is naively implemented. To address this, we propose Power\nNormalization (PN), a novel normalization scheme that resolves this issue by\n(i) relaxing zero-mean normalization in BN, (ii) incorporating a running\nquadratic mean instead of per batch statistics to stabilize fluctuations, and\n(iii) using an approximate backpropagation for incorporating the running\nstatistics in the forward pass. We show theoretically, under mild assumptions,\nthat PN leads to a smaller Lipschitz constant for the loss, compared with BN.\nFurthermore, we prove that the approximate backpropagation scheme leads to\nbounded gradients. We extensively test PN for transformers on a range of NLP\ntasks, and we show that it significantly outperforms both LN and BN. In\nparticular, PN outperforms LN by 0.4/0.6 BLEU on IWSLT14/WMT14 and 5.6/3.0 PPL\non PTB/WikiText-103.

Dynamic Token Normalization Improves Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Normalization in Transformers\"*\n\n*Ping Luo, Ying Shan, Xiaogang Wang, Xuyuan Xu, Zhaoyang Zhang, Yixiao Ge, Wenqi Shao*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants (e.g., Swin, PVT) have achieved great success in various computer vision tasks, owing to their capability to learn long-range contextual information. Layer Normalization (LN) is an essential ingredient in these models. However, we found that the ordinary LN makes tokens at different positions similar in magnitude because it normalizes embeddings within each token. It is difficult for Transformers to capture inductive bias such as the positional context in an image with LN. We tackle this problem by proposing a new normalizer, termed Dynamic Token Normalization (DTN), where normalization is performed both within each token (intra-token) and across different tokens (inter-token). DTN has several merits. Firstly, it is built on a unified formulation and thus can represent various existing normalization methods. Secondly, DTN learns to normalize tokens in both intra-token and inter-token manners, enabling Transformers to capture both the global contextual information and the local positional context. {Thirdly, by simply replacing LN layers, DTN can be readily plugged into various vision transformers, such as ViT, Swin, PVT, LeViT, T2T-ViT, BigBird and Reformer. Extensive experiments show that the transformer equipped with DTN consistently outperforms baseline model with minimal extra parameters and computational overhead. For example, DTN outperforms LN by $0.5\\%$ - $1.2\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, by $1.2$ - $1.4$ box AP in object detection on COCO benchmark, by $2.3\\%$ - $3.9\\%$ mCE in robustness experiments on ImageNet-C, and by $0.5\\%$ - $0.8\\%$ accuracy in Long ListOps on Long-Range Arena.} Codes will be made public at \\url{https://github.com/wqshao126/DTN}\n\n**Conference:** dynamic-token-normalization-improves-vision\n\n**Published:** 2021-12-05\n\n\n\n#### 2. TransGAN: Two Pure Transformers Can Make One Strong GAN, and That Can Scale Up\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Normalization in Transformers\"*\n\n*Zhangyang Wang, Shiyu Chang, Yifan Jiang*\n\n**Abstract:** The recent explosive interest on transformers has suggested their potential to become powerful \"universal\" models for computer vision tasks, such as classification, detection, and segmentation. While those attempts mainly study the discriminative models, we explore transformers on some more notoriously difficult vision tasks, e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our goal is to conduct the first pilot study in building a GAN completely free of convolutions, using only pure transformer-based architectures. Our vanilla GAN architecture, dubbed TransGAN, consists of a memory-friendly transformer-based generator that progressively increases feature resolution, and correspondingly a multi-scale discriminator to capture simultaneously semantic contexts and low-level textures. On top of them, we introduce the new module of grid self-attention for alleviating the memory bottleneck further, in order to scale up TransGAN to high-resolution generation. We also develop a unique training recipe including a series of techniques that can mitigate the training instability issues of TransGAN, such as data augmentation, modified normalization, and relative position encoding. Our best architecture achieves highly competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art GANs using convolutional backbones. Specifically, TransGAN sets new state-of-the-art inception score of 10.43 and FID of 18.28 on STL-10, outperforming StyleGAN-V2. When it comes to higher-resolution (e.g. 256 x 256) generation tasks, such as on CelebA-HQ and LSUN-Church, TransGAN continues to produce diverse visual examples with high fidelity and impressive texture details. In addition, we dive deep into the transformer-based generation models to understand how their behaviors differ from convolutional ones, by visualizing training dynamics.

This supports the use of dynamic adaptive RMSNorm in DynGatTTT.\n   - Studies like Luo et al. (2023) and Xu et al. (2023) show that dynamic normalization techniques can improve performance in vision and language models, respectively, by adapting to input context.\n\n2. **Implementation Strategies**:\n   - To mitigate computational overhead, consider strategies such as batch processing, caching, and approximation methods. For example, using batch normalization statistics to approximate dynamic normalization could help reduce computational costs.\n   - Look into optimized computation graphs and parallelization techniques to ensure scalability (e.g., using GPU acceleration or distributed training).\n\n3. **Training Stability**:\n   - Ensure training stability by carefully initializing the dynamic scaling factors and using regularization techniques. References like Xu et al. (2023) might provide insights into stabilizing dynamic normalization during training.\n\n### Advanced Gating Mechanisms\n\n1. **Feature Focus and Adaptability**:\n   - Advanced gating mechanisms, as seen in Bondarenko et al.

For instance, using gating to control the dynamic adaptation of normalization parameters could create a more integrated mechanism.\n\n2. **Quantization and Efficiency**:\n   - The work by Bondarenko et al. (2023) on quantizable transformers suggests that gating mechanisms can aid in reducing outliers and enabling quantization, which could further improve efficiency.\n   - Investigate how these mechanisms can be optimized for both training and inference efficiency.\n\n### Integration with GatedTTTLinear\n\n1. **Novelty and Feasibility**:\n   - Since there is no direct evidence of previous integrations of dynamic adaptive RMSNorm with GatedTTTLinear or GAUs, this proposal is novel and potentially groundbreaking.\n   - The feasibility of this integration is supported by related studies on dynamic normalization and advanced gating mechanisms.\n\n2. **Impact on Model Metrics**:\n   - Expected improvements in accuracy and robustness are due to enhanced adaptability to input context and improved feature representation.\n   - Ensure that the dynamic components do not significantly increase computational overhead, and optimize for efficiency and scalability.\n\n### Additional Search Queries and References\n\n- **Search for Recent Studies**:\n  - Use keywords like \"dynamic normalization in language models,\" \"advanced gating mechanisms in GAUs,\" \"efficient transformer architectures,\" and \"scalable language models\" to find recent studies.\n  - Look for papers that discuss the integration of dynamic normalization with gating mechanisms in transformer-based models.\n\n- **Optimization Techniques**:\n  - Search for papers on optimization techniques for dynamic components in neural networks, such as \"efficient dynamic normalization,\" \"optimized computation graphs for transformers,\" and \"parallelization strategies for deep learning models.\"\n\n- **Training Stability and Regularization**:\n  - Investigate papers on training stability in models with dynamic components, using keywords like \"training stability in dynamic normalization,\" \"regularization techniques for adaptive models,\" and \"initialization strategies for dynamic parameters.\"\n\n### Example Search Queries\n\n```keywords\n\"Dynamic Normalization in Language Models\", \"Advanced Gating Mechanisms in GAUs\", \"Efficient Transformer Architectures\", \"Scalable Language Models\", \"Optimized Computation Graphs for Transformers\", \"Parallelization Strategies for Deep Learning Models\", \"Training Stability in Dynamic Normalization\", \"Regularization Techniques for Adaptive Models\"\n```\n\n```description\nSeeking recent research papers on the implementation of dynamic or adaptive normalization techniques in language models, particularly focusing on Generalized Autoregressive Units (GAUs) such as GatedTTTLinear.

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

Score: 0.94)\n\n*Hanseul Cho, Jaeyoung Cha, Pranjal Awasthi, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Anupam Gupta, Chulhee Yun*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it.\n\n**Abstract:** Even for simple arithmetic tasks like integer addition, it is challenging for Transformers to generalize to longer sequences than those encountered during training. To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers (Ring Attention), which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/23 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 2023.

However, their original formulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched transformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to address these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating architectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data and compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is limited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a cost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose Scalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to uptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong pre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring 5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent in-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest linear models.

Score: 0.89)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Chain-of-Knowledge: Grounding Large Language Models via Dynamic Knowledge Adapting over Heterogeneous Sources\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Adaptive Normalization in Language Models\"*\n\n*Xingxuan Li, Ruochen Zhao, Yew Ken Chia, Bosheng Ding, Shafiq R. Joty, Soujanya Poria, Lidong Bing*\n\n**TL;DR:** Chain-of-knowledge (CoK), a novel framework that augments large language models (LLMs) by dynamically incorporating grounding information from heterogeneous sources, results in more factual rationales and reduced hallucination in generation.\n\n**Abstract:** We present chain-of-knowledge (CoK), a novel framework that augments large language models (LLMs) by dynamically incorporating grounding information from heterogeneous sources. It results in more factual rationales and reduced hallucination in generation. Specifically, CoK consists of three stages: reasoning preparation, dynamic knowledge adapting, and answer consolidation. Given a knowledge-intensive question, CoK first prepares several preliminary rationales and answers while identifying the relevant knowledge domains. If there is no majority consensus among the answers from samples, CoK corrects the rationales step by step by adapting knowledge from the identified domains. These corrected rationales can plausibly serve as a better foundation for the final answer consolidation. Unlike prior studies that primarily use unstructured data, CoK also leverages structured knowledge sources such as Wikidata and tables that provide more reliable factual information. To access both unstructured and structured knowledge sources in the dynamic knowledge adapting stage, we propose an adaptive query generator that allows the generation of queries for various types of query languages, including SPARQL, SQL, and natural sentences. Moreover, to minimize error propagation between rationales, CoK corrects the rationales progressively using preceding corrected rationales to generate and correct subsequent rationales. Extensive experiments show that CoK consistently improves the performance of LLMs on knowledge-intensive tasks across different domains.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 63  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 2. Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Adaptive Normalization in Language Models\"*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Wei Zhang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper compress generative PLMs by quantization with comparable performance with the full-precision models, and proposes a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing size of generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have greatly increased the demand for model compression. Despite various methods to compress BERT or its variants, there are few attempts to compress generative PLMs, and the underlying difficulty remains unclear. In this paper, we compress generative PLMs by quantization. We find that previous quantization methods fail on generative tasks due to the homogeneous word embeddings caused by reduced capacity and the varied distribution of weights. Correspondingly, we propose a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules. Empirical results on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compression methods on generative PLMs by a clear margin. With comparable performance with the full-precision models, we achieve 14.4x and 13.4x compression rate on GPT-2 and BART, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 89  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 3. FreshLLMs: Refreshing Large Language Models with Search Engine Augmentation\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Adaptive Normalization in Language Models\"*\n\n*Tu Vu, Mohit Iyyer, Xuezhi Wang, Noah Constant, Jerry Wei, Jason Wei, Chris Tar, Yun-Hsuan Sung, Denny Zhou, Quoc Le, Thang Luong*\n\n**TL;DR:** A detailed study of the factuality of LLM-generated text in the context of answering questions that test current world knowledge and introduces FreshQA, a novel dynamic QA benchmark encompassing a diverse range of question and answer types, including questions that require fast-changing world knowledge as well as questions with false premises that need to be debunked.\n\n**Abstract:** Most large language models (LLMs) are trained once and never updated; thus, they lack the ability to dynamically adapt to our ever-changing world. In this work, we perform a detailed study of the factuality of LLM-generated text in the context of answering questions that test current world knowledge. Specifically, we introduce FreshQA, a novel dynamic QA benchmark encompassing a diverse range of question and answer types, including questions that require fast-changing world knowledge as well as questions with false premises that need to be debunked. We benchmark a diverse array of both closed and open-source LLMs under a two-mode evaluation procedure that allows us to measure both correctness and hallucination. Through human evaluations involving more than 50K judgments, we shed light on limitations of these models and demonstrate significant room for improvement: for instance, all models (regardless of model size) struggle on questions that involve fast-changing knowledge and false premises. Motivated by these results, we present FreshPrompt, a simple few-shot prompting method that substantially boosts the performance of an LLM on FreshQA by incorporating relevant and up-to-date information retrieved from a search engine into the prompt. Our experiments show that FreshPrompt outperforms both competing search engine-augmented prompting methods such as Self-Ask (Press et al., 2022) as well as commercial systems such as Perplexity.AI. Further analysis of FreshPrompt reveals that both the number of retrieved evidences and their order play a key role in influencing the correctness of LLM-generated answers. Additionally, instructing the LLM to generate concise and direct answers helps reduce hallucination compared to encouraging more verbose answers. To facilitate future work, we release FreshQA at github.com/freshllms/freshqa and commit to updating it at regular intervals.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 118  (*Influential: 19*)\n\n#### 4. HorNet: Efficient High-Order Spatial Interactions with Recursive Gated Convolutions\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Gating Mechanisms in Transformers\"*\n\n*Yongming Rao, Wenliang Zhao, Yansong Tang, Jie Zhou, S. Lim, Jiwen Lu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Recursive Gated Convolution, a new operation that performs high-order spatial interactions with gated convolutions and recursive designs, is presented that can serve as a plug-and-play module to improve various vision Transformers and convolution-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent progress in vision Transformers exhibits great success in various tasks driven by the new spatial modeling mechanism based on dot-product self-attention. In this paper, we show that the key ingredients behind the vision Transformers, namely input-adaptive, long-range and high-order spatial interactions, can also be efficiently implemented with a convolution-based framework. We present the Recursive Gated Convolution ($\\textit{g}^\\textit{n}$Conv) that performs high-order spatial interactions with gated convolutions and recursive designs. The new operation is highly flexible and customizable, which is compatible with various variants of convolution and extends the two-order interactions in self-attention to arbitrary orders without introducing significant extra computation. $\\textit{g}^\\textit{n}$Conv can serve as a plug-and-play module to improve various vision Transformers and convolution-based models. Based on the operation, we construct a new family of generic vision backbones named HorNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet classification, COCO object detection and ADE20K semantic segmentation show HorNet outperform Swin Transformers and ConvNeXt by a significant margin with similar overall architecture and training configurations. HorNet also shows favorable scalability to more training data and larger model sizes. Apart from the effectiveness in visual encoders, we also show $\\textit{g}^\\textit{n}$Conv can be applied to task-specific decoders and consistently improve dense prediction performance with less computation. Our results demonstrate that $\\textit{g}^\\textit{n}$Conv can be a new basic module for visual modeling that effectively combines the merits of both vision Transformers and CNNs.

Outlier-Efficient Hopfield Layers for Large Transformer-Based Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Gating Mechanisms in Transformers\"*\n\n*Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Pei-Hsuan Chang, Haozheng Luo, Hong-Yu Chen, Weijian Li, Wei-Po Wang, Han Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An Outlier-Efficient Modern Hopfield Model is introduced and used to address the outlier inefficiency problem of {training} gigantic transformer-based models and a novel associative memory model facilitating outlier-efficient associative memory retrievals is introduced.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce an Outlier-Efficient Modern Hopfield Model (termed $\\mathrm{OutEffHop}$) and use it to address the outlier inefficiency problem of {training} gigantic transformer-based models. Our main contribution is a novel associative memory model facilitating \\textit{outlier-efficient} associative memory retrievals. Interestingly, this memory model manifests a model-based interpretation of an outlier-efficient attention mechanism (${\\rm Softmax}_1$): it is an approximation of the memory retrieval process of $\\mathrm{OutEffHop}$. Methodologically, this allows us to introduce novel outlier-efficient Hopfield layers as powerful alternatives to traditional attention mechanisms, with superior post-quantization performance. Theoretically, the Outlier-Efficient Modern Hopfield Model retains and improves the desirable properties of standard modern Hopfield models, including fixed point convergence and exponential storage capacity. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model across large-scale transformer-based and Hopfield-based models (including BERT, OPT, ViT, and STanHop-Net), benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods like $\\mathtt{Clipped\\_Softmax}$ and $\\mathtt{Gated\\_Attention}$.

Noise-Adaptive Confidence Sets for Linear Bandits and Application to Bayesian Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: \"Optimization Techniques for Adaptive Normalization\"*\n\n*Kwang-Sung Jun, Jungtaek Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel confidence set is proposed that is `semi-adaptive' to the unknown sub-Gaussian parameter $\\sigma_*^2$ and this leads to an improved regret bound in linear bandits and a novel variance-adaptive confidence set that has much improved numerical performance upon prior art is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Adapting to a priori unknown noise level is a very important but challenging problem in sequential decision-making as efficient exploration typically requires knowledge of the noise level, which is often loosely specified. We report significant progress in addressing this issue for linear bandits in two respects. First, we propose a novel confidence set that is `semi-adaptive' to the unknown sub-Gaussian parameter $\\sigma_*^2$ in the sense that the (normalized) confidence width scales with $\\sqrt{d\\sigma_*^2 + \\sigma_0^2}$ where $d$ is the dimension and $\\sigma_0^2$ is the specified sub-Gaussian parameter (known) that can be much larger than $\\sigma_*^2$. This is a significant improvement over $\\sqrt{d\\sigma_0^2}$ of the standard confidence set of Abbasi-Yadkori et al. (2011), especially when $d$ is large or $\\sigma_*^2=0$. We show that this leads to an improved regret bound in linear bandits. Second, for bounded rewards, we propose a novel variance-adaptive confidence set that has much improved numerical performance upon prior art. We then apply this confidence set to develop, as we claim, the first practical variance-adaptive linear bandit algorithm via an optimistic approach, which is enabled by our novel regret analysis technique. Both of our confidence sets rely critically on `regret equality' from online learning. Our empirical evaluation in diverse Bayesian optimization tasks shows that our proposed algorithms demonstrate better or comparable performance compared to existing methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Revisit Fuzzy Neural Network: Demystifying Batch Normalization and ReLU with Generalized Hamming Network\n\n*From Search Query: \"Optimization Techniques for Adaptive Normalization\"*\n\n*Lixin Fan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed generalized hamming network (GHN) as such not only lends itself to rigorous analysis and interpretation within the fuzzy logic theory but also demonstrates fast learning speed, well-controlled behaviour and state-of-the-art performances on a variety of learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** We revisit fuzzy neural network with a cornerstone notion of generalized hamming distance, which provides a novel and theoretically justified framework to re-interpret many useful neural network techniques in terms of fuzzy logic. In particular, we conjecture and empirically illustrate that, the celebrated batch normalization (BN) technique actually adapts the normalized bias such that it approximates the rightful bias induced by the generalized hamming distance. Once the due bias is enforced analytically, neither the optimization of bias terms nor the sophisticated batch normalization is needed. Also in the light of generalized hamming distance, the popular rectified linear units (ReLU) can be treated as setting a minimal hamming distance threshold between network inputs and weights. This thresholding scheme, on the one hand, can be improved by introducing double thresholding on both extremes of neuron outputs. On the other hand, ReLUs turn out to be non-essential and can be removed from networks trained for simple tasks like MNIST classification. The proposed generalized hamming network (GHN) as such not only lends itself to rigorous analysis and interpretation within the fuzzy logic theory but also demonstrates fast learning speed, well-controlled behaviour and state-of-the-art performances on a variety of learning tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8.

However, their evaluation using BLEU has been shown to weakly correlate with human annotations. Limited research compares non-autoregressive translation and autoregressive translation comprehensively, leaving uncertainty about the true proximity of NAT to AT. To address this gap, we systematically evaluate four representative NAT methods across various dimensions, including human evaluation. Our empirical results demonstrate that despite narrowing the performance gap, state-of-the-art NAT still underperforms AT under more reliable evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we discover that explicitly modeling dependencies is crucial for generating natural language and generalizing to out-of-distribution sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9.

However, this fast-growing area lacks standardized evaluation suites for non-English languages, hindering progress outside the Anglo-centric paradigm. To address this line of research, we propose TAPE (Text Attack and Perturbation Evaluation), a novel benchmark that includes six more complex NLU tasks for Russian, covering multi-hop reasoning, ethical concepts, logic and commonsense knowledge. The TAPE's design focuses on systematic zero-shot and few-shot NLU evaluation: (i) linguistic-oriented adversarial attacks and perturbations for analyzing robustness, and (ii) subpopulations for nuanced interpretation. The detailed analysis of testing the autoregressive baselines indicates that simple spelling-based perturbations affect the performance the most, while paraphrasing the input has a more negligible effect. At the same time, the results demonstrate a significant gap between the neural and human baselines for most tasks. We publicly release TAPE (tape-benchmark.com) to foster research on robust LMs that can generalize to new tasks when little to no supervision is available.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 9 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Dynamic Layer Normalization for Adaptive Neural Acoustic Modeling in\n  Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Adaptive Normalization in Language Models\"*\n\n*Taesup Kim, Inchul Song, Yoshua Bengio*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization is a recently introduced technique for normalizing the\nactivities of neurons in deep neural networks to improve the training speed and\nstability. In this paper, we introduce a new layer normalization technique\ncalled Dynamic Layer Normalization (DLN) for adaptive neural acoustic modeling\nin speech recognition. By dynamically generating the scaling and shifting\nparameters in layer normalization, DLN adapts neural acoustic models to the\nacoustic variability arising from various factors such as speakers, channel\nnoises, and environments. Unlike other adaptive acoustic models, our proposed\napproach does not require additional adaptation data or speaker information\nsuch as i-vectors. Moreover, the model size is fixed as it dynamically\ngenerates adaptation parameters. We apply our proposed DLN to deep\nbidirectional LSTM acoustic models and evaluate them on two benchmark datasets\nfor large vocabulary ASR experiments: WSJ and TED-LIUM release 2. The\nexperimental results show that our DLN improves neural acoustic models in terms\nof transcription accuracy by dynamically adapting to various speakers and\nenvironments.\n\n**Published:** 2017-07-19T13:04:09Z  (*Updated: 2017-07-19T13:04:09Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

This dynamic adaptation facilitates more\nefficient problem-solving, particularly in smaller models, by reducing\nhallucinations and repetitive cycles.

Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Gating Mechanisms in Transformers\"*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have surpassed RNNs in popularity due to their superior\nabilities in parallel training and long-term dependency modeling. Recently,\nthere has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence\nmodeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the\nlinear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates\nwithin the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model\ndubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes\nforget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound\nincreases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to\nmodel long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local,\nshort-term dependencies.

Methods of improving LLM training stability\n\n*From Search Query: \"Stabilizing Training with Dynamic Normalization\"*\n\n*Oleg Rybakov, Mike Chrzanowski, Peter Dykas, Jinze Xue, Ben Lanir*\n\n**Abstract:** Training stability of large language models(LLMs) is an important research\ntopic. Reproducing training instabilities can be costly, so we use a small\nlanguage model with 830M parameters and experiment with higher learning rates\nto force models to diverge. One of the sources of training instability is the\ngrowth of logits in attention layers. We extend the focus of the previous work\nand look not only at the magnitude of the logits but at all outputs of linear\nlayers in the Transformer block. We observe that with a high learning rate the\nL2 norm of all linear layer outputs can grow with each training step and the\nmodel diverges. Specifically we observe that QKV, Proj and FC2 layers have the\nlargest growth of the output magnitude. This prompts us to explore several\noptions: 1) apply layer normalization not only after QK layers but also after\nProj and FC2 layers too; 2) apply layer normalization after the QKV layer (and\nremove pre normalization). 3) apply QK layer normalization together with\nsoftmax capping. We show that with the last two methods we can increase\nlearning rate by 1.5x (without model divergence) in comparison to an approach\nbased on QK layer normalization only. Also we observe significant perplexity\nimprovements for all three methods in comparison to the baseline model.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-22T04:27:03Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-22T04:27:03Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. AdaLomo: Low-memory Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate\n\n*From Search Query: \"Optimization Techniques for Adaptive Normalization\"*\n\n*Kai Lv, Hang Yan, Qipeng Guo, Haijun Lv, Xipeng Qiu*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have achieved remarkable success, but their extensive\nparameter size necessitates substantial memory for training, thereby setting a\nhigh threshold. While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO)\nreduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic\ngradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal\nconvergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for\nlarge language models, AdamW. Through empirical analysis of the Adam optimizer,\nwe found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more\ncritical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the\nlow-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an\nadaptive learning rate for each parameter. To maintain memory efficiency, we\nemploy non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation\nin the optimizer state. Additionally, we suggest the use of a grouped update\nnormalization to stabilize convergence. Our experiments with instruction-tuning\nand further pre-training demonstrate that AdaLomo achieves results on par with\nAdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the\nhardware barrier to training large language models.

Direct Multi-Turn Preference Optimization for Language Agents\n\n*From Search Query: \"Optimization Techniques for Adaptive Normalization\"*\n\n*Wentao Shi, Mengqi Yuan, Junkang Wu, Qifan Wang, Fuli Feng*\n\n**Abstract:** Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for agent tasks is critical in\ndeveloping language agents. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a promising\ntechnique for this adaptation with the alleviation of compounding errors,\noffering a means to directly optimize Reinforcement Learning (RL) objectives.\nHowever, applying DPO to multi-turn tasks presents challenges due to the\ninability to cancel the partition function. Overcoming this obstacle involves\nmaking the partition function independent of the current state and addressing\nlength disparities between preferred and dis-preferred trajectories. In this\nlight, we replace the policy constraint with the state-action occupancy measure\nconstraint in the RL objective and add length normalization to the\nBradley-Terry model, yielding a novel loss function named DMPO for multi-turn\nagent tasks with theoretical explanations. Extensive experiments on three\nmulti-turn agent task datasets confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the\nDMPO loss.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-21T05:13:20Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-17T09:33:12Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 8. A Survey on Non-Autoregressive Generation for Neural Machine Translation\n  and Beyond\n\n*From Search Query: \"Recent Advances in Generalized Autoregressive Units\"*\n\n*Yisheng Xiao, Lijun Wu, Junliang Guo, Juntao Li, Min Zhang, Tao Qin, Tie-yan Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Non-autoregressive (NAR) generation, which is first proposed in neural\nmachine translation (NMT) to speed up inference, has attracted much attention\nin both machine learning and natural language processing communities. While NAR\ngeneration can significantly accelerate inference speed for machine\ntranslation, the speedup comes at the cost of sacrificed translation accuracy\ncompared to its counterpart, autoregressive (AR) generation. In recent years,\nmany new models and algorithms have been designed/proposed to bridge the\naccuracy gap between NAR generation and AR generation. In this paper, we\nconduct a systematic survey with comparisons and discussions of various\nnon-autoregressive translation (NAT) models from different aspects.\nSpecifically, we categorize the efforts of NAT into several groups, including\ndata manipulation, modeling methods, training criterion, decoding algorithms,\nand the benefit from pre-trained models.

Beyond Autoregression: Fast LLMs via Self-Distillation Through Time\n\n*From Search Query: \"Recent Advances in Generalized Autoregressive Units\"*\n\n*Justin Deschenaux, Caglar Gulcehre*\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive (AR) Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated\nsignificant success across numerous tasks. However, the AR modeling paradigm\npresents certain limitations; for instance, contemporary autoregressive LLMs\nare trained to generate one token at a time, which can result in noticeable\nlatency. Recent advances have indicated that search and repeated sampling can\nenhance performance in various applications, such as theorem proving, code\ngeneration, and alignment, by utilizing greater computational resources during\ninference. In this study, we demonstrate that diffusion language models are\ncapable of generating at least 32 tokens simultaneously, while exceeding the\nperformance of AR models in text quality and on the LAMBADA natural language\nunderstanding benchmark. This outcome is achieved through a novel distillation\nmethod for discrete diffusion models, which reduces the number of inference\nsteps by a factor of 32-64. Practically, our models, even without caching, can\ngenerate tokens at a rate that is up to 8 times faster than AR models employing\nKV caching, and we anticipate further improvements with the inclusion of\ncaching. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for diffusion\nlanguage models with up to 860M parameters.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-28T13:56:30Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-28T13:56:30Z*)\n\n\n\n### 7 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Twin-Merging: Dynamic Integration of Modular Expertise in Model Merging\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Adaptive Normalization in Language Models\"*\n\n*Yu Cheng, Dangyang Chen, Xiaoye Qu, Wei Wei, Chenghao Fan, Zhenyi Lu*\n\n**Abstract:** In the era of large language models, model merging is a promising way to combine multiple task-specific models into a single multitask model without extra training. However, two challenges remain: (a) interference between different models and (b) heterogeneous data during testing. Traditional model merging methods often show significant performance gaps compared to fine-tuned models due to these issues. Additionally, a one-size-fits-all model lacks flexibility for diverse test data, leading to performance degradation. We show that both shared and exclusive task-specific knowledge are crucial for merging performance, but directly merging exclusive knowledge hinders overall performance. In view of this, we propose Twin-Merging, a method that encompasses two principal stages: (1) modularizing knowledge into shared and exclusive components, with compression to reduce redundancy and enhance efficiency; (2) dynamically merging shared and task-specific knowledge based on the input. This approach narrows the performance gap between merged and fine-tuned models and improves adaptability to heterogeneous data. Extensive experiments on $20$ datasets for both language and vision tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing an average improvement of $28.34\\%$ in absolute normalized score for discriminative tasks and even surpassing the fine-tuned upper bound on the generative tasks. Our implementation is available in \\url{https://github.com/LZY-the-boys/Twin-Merging}\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-17\n\n\n\n#### 2. p-Laplacian Adaptation for Generative Pre-trained Vision-Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Adaptive Normalization in Language Models\"*\n\n*Bei Yu, Xufeng Yao, Peiyu Liao, Peng Xu, Xinyun Zhang, Haoyuan Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision-Language models (VLMs) pre-trained on large corpora have demonstrated notable success across a range of downstream tasks. In light of the rapidly increasing size of pre-trained VLMs, parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) has garnered attention as a viable alternative to full fine-tuning. One such approach is the adapter, which introduces a few trainable parameters into the pre-trained models while preserving the original parameters during adaptation. In this paper, we present a novel modeling framework that recasts adapter tuning after attention as a graph message passing process on attention graphs, where the projected query and value features and attention matrix constitute the node features and the graph adjacency matrix, respectively. Within this framework, tuning adapters in VLMs necessitates handling heterophilic graphs, owing to the disparity between the projected query and value space. To address this challenge, we propose a new adapter architecture, $p$-adapter, which employs $p$-Laplacian message passing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Specifically, the attention weights are re-normalized based on the features, and the features are then aggregated using the calibrated attention matrix, enabling the dynamic exploitation of information with varying frequencies in the heterophilic attention graphs. We conduct extensive experiments on different pre-trained VLMs and multi-modal tasks, including visual question answering, visual entailment, and image captioning. The experimental results validate our method's significant superiority over other PETL methods.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-17\n\n\n\n#### 3. Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Gating Mechanisms in Transformers\"*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Jonathan May, Graham Neubig, Liangke Gui, Junxian He, Xiang Kong, Chunting Zhou, Xuezhe Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** The design choices in the Transformer attention mechanism, including weak inductive bias and quadratic computational complexity, have limited its application for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 4. LLaMA-Adapter: Efficient Fine-tuning of Language Models with Zero-init Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Gating Mechanisms in Transformers\"*\n\n*Peng Gao, Chris Liu, Yu Qiao, Hongsheng Li, Pan Lu, Shilin Yan, Xiangfei Hu, Aojun Zhou, Jiaming Han, Renrui Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** We present LLaMA-Adapter, a lightweight adaption method to efficiently fine-tune LLaMA into an instruction-following model. Using 52K self-instruct demonstrations, LLaMA-Adapter only introduces 1.2M learnable parameters upon the frozen LLaMA 7B model, and costs less than one hour for fine-tuning on 8 A100 GPUs. Specifically, we adopt a set of learnable adaption prompts, and prepend them to the word tokens at higher transformer layers. Then, a zero-initialized attention mechanism with zero gating is proposed, which adaptively injects the new instructional cues into LLaMA, while effectively preserves its pre-trained knowledge. With our efficient training, LLaMA-Adapter can generate high-quality responses, comparable to Alpaca with fully fine-tuned 7B parameters. Besides language commands, our approach can be simply extended to multi-modal instructions for learning image-conditioned LLaMA model, which achieves superior reasoning performance on ScienceQA and COCO Caption benchmarks. Furthermore, we also evaluate the zero-initialized attention mechanism for fine-tuning other pre-trained models (ViT, RoBERTa) on traditional vision and language tasks, demonstrating the superior generalization capacity of our approach.

Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: \"Stabilizing Training with Dynamic Normalization\"*\n\n*Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, Geoffrey E. Hinton*\n\n**Abstract:** Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive.\nOne way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the\nneurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the\ndistribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training\ncases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the\nsummed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces\nthe training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch\nnormalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to\napply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch\nnormalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used\nfor normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a\nsingle training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its\nown adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before\nthe non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs\nexactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also\nstraightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the\nnormalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is\nvery effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks.\nEmpirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the\ntraining time compared with previously published techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2016-07-21\n\n\n\n#### 6. Neural Lander: Stable Drone Landing Control using Learned Dynamics\n\n*From Search Query: \"Stabilizing Training with Dynamic Normalization\"*\n\n*Soon-Jo Chung, Yisong Yue, Animashree Anandkumar, Michael O'Connell, Xichen Shi, Rose Yu, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, Guanya Shi*\n\n**Abstract:** Precise near-ground trajectory control is difficult for multi-rotor drones,\ndue to the complex aerodynamic effects caused by interactions between\nmulti-rotor airflow and the environment. Conventional control methods often\nfail to properly account for these complex effects and fall short in\naccomplishing smooth landing. In this paper, we present a novel\ndeep-learning-based robust nonlinear controller (Neural Lander) that improves\ncontrol performance of a quadrotor during landing. Our approach combines a\nnominal dynamics model with a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that learns high-order\ninteractions. We apply spectral normalization (SN) to constrain the Lipschitz\nconstant of the DNN. Leveraging this Lipschitz property, we design a nonlinear\nfeedback linearization controller using the learned model and prove system\nstability with disturbance rejection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst DNN-based nonlinear feedback controller with stability guarantees that\ncan utilize arbitrarily large neural nets. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed controller significantly outperforms a Baseline Nonlinear\nTracking Controller in both landing and cross-table trajectory tracking cases.\nWe also empirically show that the DNN generalizes well to unseen data outside\nthe training domain.\n\n**Published:** 2018-11-19\n\n\n\n#### 7. Universally Slimmable Networks and Improved Training Techniques\n\n*From Search Query: \"Optimization Techniques for Adaptive Normalization\"*\n\n*Thomas Huang, Jiahui Yu*\n\n**Abstract:** Slimmable networks are a family of neural networks that can instantly adjust the runtime width. The width can be chosen from a predefined widths set to adaptively optimize accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime. In this work, we propose a systematic approach to train universally slimmable networks (US-Nets), extending slimmable networks to execute at arbitrary width, and generalizing to networks both with and without batch normalization layers. We further propose two improved training techniques for US-Nets, named the sandwich rule and inplace distillation, to enhance training process and boost testing accuracy. We show improved performance of universally slimmable MobileNet v1 and MobileNet v2 on ImageNet classification task, compared with individually trained ones and 4-switch slimmable network baselines. We also evaluate the proposed US-Nets and improved training techniques on tasks of image super-resolution and deep reinforcement learning. Extensive ablation experiments on these representative tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

While GAUs have demonstrated significant efficiency and scalability, their performance is often constrained by static normalization techniques and limited adaptability to diverse input distributions and long-range dependencies. Traditional normalization methods like Root Mean Square Layer Normalization (RMSNorm) offer computational efficiency but lack the flexibility required to dynamically adjust scaling factors based on contextual information. This limitation hinders the model's ability to maintain high perplexity performance, robustly handle varied inputs, and efficiently scale with larger datasets and model sizes.

Despite their efficiency and scalability, GAUs often rely on static normalization techniques like Root Mean Square Layer Normalization (RMSNorm), which apply fixed scaling factors across all inputs. This static nature limits the model's adaptability to diverse input distributions and long-range dependencies, hindering performance metrics such as perplexity, downstream task accuracy, and robustness. Furthermore, as models scale to larger sizes and longer sequences, the inability to dynamically adjust normalization parameters poses significant challenges in maintaining computational efficiency and memory utilization.

By enabling context-aware scaling and selective information flow, DynGatTTT addresses the limitations of static normalization techniques, thereby improving perplexity, downstream task accuracy, robustness, and scalability. The synergistic integration of dynamic normalization with graph convolutions further enriches the model's ability to capture complex relational dependencies, ensuring efficient processing of both local and global contextual information. These enhancements are expected to result in a more adaptable, efficient, and high-performing LM block design that outperforms current state-of-the-art models across various benchmarks and real-world applications.\n\n## References\n\n1. **Zhang, B., Titov, I., & Sennrich, R.** (2021). *Sparse Attention with Linear Units*.

This hybrid approach addresses the inherent limitations of static normalization techniques, enabling the model to adaptively scale features based on contextual information and selectively control the flow of information through sophisticated gating mechanisms. By incorporating dynamic RMSNorm, DynGatTTT enhances the model's ability to handle diverse input distributions and long-range dependencies, thereby improving perplexity, downstream task accuracy, and robustness. The synergistic integration with graph convolutions allows for the effective capturing of complex relational dependencies, further enriching the model's contextual understanding. These enhancements are expected to result in a more adaptable, efficient, and high-performing LM block design that outperforms current state-of-the-art models across various benchmarks and real-world applications.\n\n## References\n\n1. **Zhang, B., Titov, I., & Sennrich, R.** (2021). *Sparse Attention with Linear Units*.

This proposal leverages insights from recent advancements in dynamic normalization and gating strategies, ensuring that the model remains both adaptable and computationally efficient. The synergistic combination of dynamic normalization with graph convolutions provides a robust framework for capturing complex relational dependencies, positioning DynGatTTT as a competitive architecture in the landscape of modern autoregressive language models.",
