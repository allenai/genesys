    "review": "## Comprehensive Review of the SSMFastTTTLinear Proposal\n\n### 1. Summary of the Review\n\nThe **SSMFastTTTLinear** proposal presents an innovative enhancement to the **FastTTTLinear** Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) by integrating **State Space Models (SSMs)** with **Gated Linear Attention (GLA)**. This integration aims to leverage the strengths of SSMs in modeling long-range dependencies, thereby improving both the efficiency and expressiveness of the GAU in handling extended contexts without significant computational or memory overhead. The proposal exhibits a strong theoretical foundation and aligns well with current research trends, particularly those demonstrated by models like **Mamba** and **Transformers are SSMs**.\n\n### 2. Strengths\n\n#### **a. Theoretical Foundation and Innovation**\n- **State Space Duality (SSD):** The proposal leverages the SSD framework, establishing a robust theoretical connection between SSMs and attention mechanisms. This duality ensures that the integration is grounded in established research, enhancing the proposal's credibility.\n- **Hybrid Architecture:** Combining SSMs with GLA within the GAU framework introduces a novel approach that encapsulates both global and local dependency modeling. This dual mechanism is expected to outperform existing models by capturing a broader range of dependencies efficiently.\n- **Gating Mechanisms:** The use of gating functions to balance the contributions of SSMs and GLA enhances the model's expressiveness and adaptability, allowing it to focus on relevant information dynamically.\n\n#### **b. Performance Potential**\n- **Efficiency Gains:** Integrating SSMs, known for their linear computational complexity, with GLA is poised to maintain or even improve the computational efficiency of the GAU, especially for long sequences.\n- **Expressiveness and Accuracy:** By capturing both local (via GLA) and global (via SSMs) dependencies, the enhanced GAU is likely to achieve lower perplexity and higher accuracy on downstream tasks that require understanding of extended contexts.\n- **Scalability:** The linear scaling properties of both SSMs and GLA suggest that the **SSMFastTTTLinear** GAU will scale effectively with increasing model sizes and data volumes, addressing one of the primary limitations of traditional attention mechanisms.\n\n#### **c. Alignment with Current Research**\n- **Benchmark Performance:** Existing models like **Mamba** have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as the Long Range Arena (LRA), indicating the viability and effectiveness of integrating SSMs with attention mechanisms.\n- **Modularity and Flexibility:** The proposed design maintains the modularity of GAUs, allowing for easy integration and potential extensions, which is a desirable trait in modern language model architectures.\n\n### 3. Concerns\n\n#### **a. Integration Complexity**\n- **Architectural Complexity:** Combining SSMs with GLA within the GAU framework introduces additional layers of complexity. Ensuring seamless integration without introducing redundancies or conflicts is critical and may pose implementation challenges.\n- **Parameter Management:** The integration may require careful tuning of parameters to balance the contributions of SSMs and GLA, preventing issues like overfitting or underutilization of either mechanism.\n\n#### **b. Numerical Stability and Normalization**\n- **Stability Concerns:** Introducing SSMs, which involve recursive state updates, alongside GLA necessitates robust normalization techniques (e.g., RMSNorm, LayerNorm) to maintain numerical stability during training and inference.\n- **Normalization Impact:** The interplay between gating mechanisms and normalization layers must be meticulously managed to preserve the model's expressiveness and prevent gradient vanishing or explosion.\n\n#### **c. Memory and Computational Overhead**\n- **State Management:** SSMs are inherently stateful, requiring efficient memory management to handle the hidden states, especially for very long sequences. Ensuring that the memory footprint remains manageable is essential.\n- **Computational Redundancies:** While both SSMs and GLA operate with linear complexity, their integration may inadvertently introduce duplicated computations or inefficiencies that could negate the intended performance gains.\n\n#### **d. Empirical Validation**\n- **Lack of Preliminary Results:** The proposal would benefit from preliminary empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of the integration, particularly in terms of perplexity reduction, accuracy improvement, and efficiency gains compared to FastTTTLinear and other baseline models.\n- **Benchmarking Strategy:** Clear benchmarking against state-of-the-art models on standardized datasets is necessary to substantiate the claimed improvements and to identify potential trade-offs.\n\n### 4. Suggestions for Improvement\n\n#### **a. Detailed Implementation Guidelines**\n- **Architectural Blueprint:** Provide a comprehensive architectural diagram and step-by-step integration guidelines to facilitate seamless implementation. This should include specifics on how SSMs and GLA interact within the GAU framework.\n- **Parameter Initialization:** Offer strategies for initializing parameters, especially for the SSM components, to ensure stable and efficient training. Leveraging insights from **Structured State Space Duality** can aid in this aspect.\n\n#### **b. Empirical Validation and Benchmarking**\n- **Preliminary Experiments:** Conduct initial experiments to showcase the integration's impact on key performance metrics such as perplexity, accuracy on downstream tasks, and computational efficiency. This empirical evidence is crucial for validating the theoretical benefits.\n- **Comprehensive Benchmarking:** Evaluate the enhanced GAU on a diverse set of benchmarks, including but not limited to the Long Range Arena (LRA), language modeling datasets, and real-world tasks requiring long-context understanding.\n\n#### **c. Optimization Techniques**\n- **Memory Optimization:** Explore advanced memory management techniques, possibly inspired by **DenseMamba** and **SeqBoat**, to handle the stateful nature of SSMs efficiently. Techniques like memory tiling or hierarchical state management can be investigated.\n- **Computational Efficiency:** Implement hardware-aware optimizations to ensure that the integration of SSMs and GLA does not introduce significant computational overheads. Leveraging optimized libraries or parallelization strategies can be beneficial.\n\n#### **d. Robust Normalization Strategies**\n- **Advanced Normalization:** Implement and test different normalization strategies to ensure numerical stability. Comparing the effects of RMSNorm versus LayerNorm in the integrated GAU can provide insights into the best practices for maintaining stability without sacrificing performance.\n- **Gating and Normalization Interaction:** Study the interaction between gating mechanisms and normalization layers to optimize the flow of information and gradients through the network.\n\n#### **e. Theoretical Extensions**\n- **State Space Duality Exploration:** Further explore the theoretical connections established by the SSD framework to uncover additional optimizations or architectural refinements that can enhance the integration\u2019s effectiveness.\n- **Expressivity Analysis:** Conduct a formal analysis of the model's expressiveness post-integration to ensure that combining SSMs with GLA indeed expands the GAU's capacity without introducing limitations.\n\n### 5. Final Rating\n\n```rating 4.2```\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nThe **SSMFastTTTLinear** proposal presents a promising and innovative enhancement to the **FastTTTLinear** GAU by integrating **State Space Models (SSMs)** with **Gated Linear Attention (GLA)**. This integration is well-founded theoretically and aligns with current research trends that demonstrate significant performance and efficiency gains through similar hybrid architectures. While the proposal exhibits strong potential in improving long-sequence modeling efficiency and expressiveness, it also introduces complexities that necessitate careful implementation and empirical validation.

Luna: Linear unified nested attention (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Xuezhe Ma, Xiang Kong, Sinong Wang, Chunting Zhou, Jonathan May, Hao Ma, Luke Zettlemoyer*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 94  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Luna is proposed, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear time and space complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic computational and memory complexities of the Transformer's attention mechanism have limited its scalability for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 3. Efficient Long Sequence Modeling via State Space Augmented Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Simiao Zuo, Xiaodong Liu, Jian Jiao, Denis Xavier Charles, Eren Manavoglu, Tuo Zhao, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2022)\t**Cited by** 29  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed SPADE augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods and demonstrates the scalability of the proposed method.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models have achieved superior performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/35 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nAlbert Gu, Karan Goel, and Christopher R\u00e9. 2021.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

ChordMixer: A Scalable Neural Attention Model for Sequences with Different Lengths (Avg.

As an important modeling tool, neural attention should capture long-range interaction in such sequences. However, most existing neural attention models admit only short sequences, or they have to employ chunking or padding to enforce a constant input length. Here we propose a simple neural network building block called ChordMixer which can model the attention for long sequences with variable lengths. Each ChordMixer block consists of a position-wise rotation layer without learnable parameters and an element-wise MLP layer. Repeatedly applying such blocks forms an effective network backbone that mixes the input signals towards the learning targets. We have tested ChordMixer on the synthetic adding problem, long document classification, and DNA sequence-based taxonomy classification. The experiment results show that our method substantially outperforms other neural attention models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), volume 30, 2017.

Polyhedron Attention Module: Learning Adaptive-order Interactions\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive Linear Attention\"*\n\n*Tan Zhu, Fei Dou, Xinyu Wang, Jin Lu, Jinbo Bi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A Polyhedron Attention Module (PAM) is proposed to create piecewise polynomial models where the input space is split into poly-hedrons which define the different pieces and on each piece the hyperplanes that define the polyhedron boundary multiply to form the interactive terms, resulting in interactions of adaptive order to each piece.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning feature interactions can be the key for multivariate predictive modeling. ReLU-activated neural networks create piecewise linear prediction models. Other nonlinear activation functions lead to models with only high-order feature interactions, thus lacking of interpretability. Recent methods incorporate candidate polynomial terms of fixed orders into deep learning, which is subject to the issue of combinatorial explosion, or learn the orders that are difficult to adapt to different regions of the feature space. We propose a Polyhedron Attention Module (PAM) to create piecewise polynomial models where the input space is split into poly-hedrons which define the different pieces and on each piece the hyperplanes that define the polyhedron boundary multiply to form the interactive terms, resulting in interactions of adaptive order to each piece. PAM is interpretable to identify important interactions in predicting a target. Theoretic analysis shows that PAM has stronger expression capability than ReLU-activated networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior classification performance of PAM on massive datasets of the click-through rate prediction and PAM can learn meaningful interaction effects in a medical problem.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Transformers meet Stochastic Block Models: Attention with Data-Adaptive Sparsity and Cost\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive Linear Attention\"*\n\n*Sungjun Cho, Seonwoo Min, Jinwoo Kim, Moontae Lee, Honglak Lee, Seunghoon Hong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation, and theoretically shows that it outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.\n\n**Abstract:** To overcome the quadratic cost of self-attention, recent works have proposed various sparse attention modules, most of which fall under one of two groups: 1) sparse attention under a hand-crafted patterns and 2) full attention followed by a sparse variant of softmax such as $\\alpha$-entmax. Unfortunately, the first group lacks adaptability to data while the second still requires quadratic cost in training. In this work, we propose SBM-Transformer, a model that resolves both problems by endowing each attention head with a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM). Then, each attention head data-adaptively samples a bipartite graph, the adjacency of which is used as an attention mask for each input. During backpropagation, a straight-through estimator is used to flow gradients beyond the discrete sampling step and adjust the probabilities of sampled edges based on the predictive loss. The forward and backward cost are thus linear to the number of edges, which each attention head can also choose flexibly based on the input. By assessing the distribution of graphs, we theoretically show that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation. Empirical evaluations under the LRA and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.

To address this limitation, Linformer and Informer reduce the quadratic complexity to linear (modulo logarithmic factors) via low-dimensional projection and row selection, respectively. These two models are intrinsically connected, and to understand their connection we introduce a theoretical framework of matrix sketching. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose Skeinformer to accelerate self-attention and further improve the accuracy of matrix approximation to self-attention with column sampling, adaptive row normalization and pilot sampling reutilization.

Context Compression for Auto-regressive Transformers with Sentinel Tokens\n\n*From Search Query: \"Memory Compression in Transformers\"*\n\n*Siyu Ren, Qi Jia, Kenny Q. Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a plug-and-play approach that is able to incrementally compress the intermediate activation of a specified span of tokens into compact ones, thereby reducing both memory and computational cost when processing subsequent context.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic complexity of the attention module makes it gradually become the bulk of compute in Transformer-based LLMs during generation. Moreover, the excessive key-value cache that arises when dealing with long inputs also brings severe issues on memory footprint and inference latency. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play approach that is able to incrementally compress the intermediate activation of a specified span of tokens into compact ones, thereby reducing both memory and computational cost when processing subsequent context. Experiments on both in-domain language modeling and zero-shot open-ended document generation demonstrate the advantage of our approach over sparse attention baselines in terms of fluency, n-gram matching, and semantic similarity. At last, we comprehensively profile the benefit of context compression on improving the system throughout.

Dynamic Memory Compression: Retrofitting LLMs for Accelerated Inference\n\n*From Search Query: \"Memory Compression in Transformers\"*\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Adrian La'ncucki, Marcin Chochowski, David Tarjan, E. Ponti*\n\n**TL;DR:** Dynamic Memory Compression can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as the backbone of large language models (LLMs). However, generation remains inefficient due to the need to store in memory a cache of key-value representations for past tokens, whose size scales linearly with the input sequence length and batch size. As a solution, we propose Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC), a method for online key-value cache compression at inference time. Most importantly, the model learns to apply different compression ratios in different heads and layers. We retrofit pre-trained LLMs such as Llama 2 (7B, 13B and 70B) into DMC Transformers, achieving up to 7x throughput increase during auto-regressive inference on an NVIDIA H100 GPU. DMC is applied via continued pre-training on a negligible percentage of the original data without adding any extra parameters. DMC preserves the original downstream performance with up to 4x cache compression, outperforming up-trained grouped-query attention (GQA) and key-value eviction policies (H$_2$O, TOVA). GQA and DMC can be even combined to obtain compounded gains. Hence, DMC can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. HomoDistil: Homotopic Task-Agnostic Distillation of Pre-trained Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"Memory Compression in Transformers\"*\n\n*Chen Liang, Haoming Jiang, Zheng Li, Xianfeng Tang, Bin Yin, Tuo Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed Homotopic Distillation (HomoDistil), a novel task-agnostic distillation approach equipped with iterative pruning that maintains a small discrepancy between the teacher's and student's predictions throughout the distillation process, which ensures the effectiveness of knowledge transfer.\n\n**Abstract:** Knowledge distillation has been shown to be a powerful model compression approach to facilitate the deployment of pre-trained language models in practice. This paper focuses on task-agnostic distillation. It produces a compact pre-trained model that can be easily fine-tuned on various tasks with small computational costs and memory footprints. Despite the practical benefits, task-agnostic distillation is challenging. Since the teacher model has a significantly larger capacity and stronger representation power than the student model, it is very difficult for the student to produce predictions that match the teacher's over a massive amount of open-domain training data. Such a large prediction discrepancy often diminishes the benefits of knowledge distillation. To address this challenge, we propose Homotopic Distillation (HomoDistil), a novel task-agnostic distillation approach equipped with iterative pruning. Specifically, we initialize the student model from the teacher model, and iteratively prune the student's neurons until the target width is reached. Such an approach maintains a small discrepancy between the teacher's and student's predictions throughout the distillation process, which ensures the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HomoDistil achieves significant improvements on existing baselines.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Efficient Long-Range Transformers: You Need to Attend More, but Not Necessarily at Every Layer\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Long-Range Attention\"*\n\n*Qingru Zhang, Dhananjay Ram, Cole Hawkins, Sheng Zha, Tuo Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** MASFormer, an easy-to-implement transformer variant with Mixed Attention Spans, is proposed, which is equipped with full attention to capture long-range dependencies, but only at a small number of layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained transformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks. These models leverage the attention mechanism to capture long- and short-range dependencies in the sequence. However, the (full) attention mechanism incurs high computational cost - quadratic in the sequence length, which is not affordable in tasks with long sequences, e.g., inputs with 8k tokens. Although sparse attention can be used to improve computational efficiency, as suggested in existing work, it has limited modeling capacity and often fails to capture complicated dependencies in long sequences. To tackle this challenge, we propose MASFormer, an easy-to-implement transformer variant with Mixed Attention Spans. Specifically, MASFormer is equipped with full attention to capture long-range dependencies, but only at a small number of layers. For the remaining layers, MASformer only employs sparse attention to capture short-range dependencies. Our experiments on natural language modeling and generation tasks show that a decoder-only MASFormer model of 1.3B parameters can achieve competitive performance to vanilla transformers with full attention while significantly reducing computational cost (up to 75%). Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of continual training with long sequence data and how sequence length impacts downstream generation performance, which may be of independent interest.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8.

Rao, Liu Yang, Sebastian Ruder, Donald Metzler*\n\n**TL;DR:** A systematic and unified benchmark, LRA, specifically focused on evaluating model quality under long-context scenarios is proposed, paving the way towards better understanding this class of efficient Transformer models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers do not scale very well to long sequence lengths largely because of quadratic self-attention complexity. In the recent months, a wide spectrum of efficient, fast Transformers have been proposed to tackle this problem, more often than not claiming superior or comparable model quality to vanilla Transformer models. To this date, there is no well-established consensus on how to evaluate this class of models. Moreover, inconsistent benchmarking on a wide spectrum of tasks and datasets makes it difficult to assess relative model quality amongst many models. This paper proposes a systematic and unified benchmark, LRA, specifically focused on evaluating model quality under long-context scenarios. Our benchmark is a suite of tasks consisting of sequences ranging from $1K$ to $16K$ tokens, encompassing a wide range of data types and modalities such as text, natural, synthetic images, and mathematical expressions requiring similarity, structural, and visual-spatial reasoning. We systematically evaluate ten well-established long-range Transformer models (Reformers, Linformers, Linear Transformers, Sinkhorn Transformers, Performers, Synthesizers, Sparse Transformers, and Longformers) on our newly proposed benchmark suite. LRA paves the way towards better understanding this class of efficient Transformer models, facilitates more research in this direction, and presents new challenging tasks to tackle.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Long-Range Attention\"*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1350  (*Influential: 136*)\n\n### 5 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax\n  Mimicry\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive Linear Attention\"*\n\n*Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency,\nreducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs.

WavSpA: Wavelet Space Attention for Boosting Transformers' Long Sequence\n  Learning Ability\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive Linear Attention\"*\n\n*Yufan Zhuang, Zihan Wang, Fangbo Tao, Jingbo Shang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer and its variants are fundamental neural architectures in deep\nlearning. Recent works show that learning attention in the Fourier space can\nimprove the long sequence learning capability of Transformers. We argue that\nwavelet transform shall be a better choice because it captures both position\nand frequency information with linear time complexity. Therefore, in this\npaper, we systematically study the synergy between wavelet transform and\nTransformers. We propose Wavelet Space Attention (WavSpA) that facilitates\nattention learning in a learnable wavelet coefficient space which replaces the\nattention in Transformers by (1) applying forward wavelet transform to project\nthe input sequences to multi-resolution bases, (2) conducting attention\nlearning in the wavelet coefficient space, and (3) reconstructing the\nrepresentation in input space via backward wavelet transform. Extensive\nexperiments on the Long Range Arena demonstrate that learning attention in the\nwavelet space using either fixed or adaptive wavelets can consistently improve\nTransformer's performance and also significantly outperform learning in Fourier\nspace. We further show our method can enhance Transformer's reasoning\nextrapolation capability over distance on the LEGO chain-of-reasoning task.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-05T02:37:59Z  (*Updated: 2023-05-22T22:42:47Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. LoMA: Lossless Compressed Memory Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"Memory Compression in Transformers\"*\n\n*Yumeng Wang, Zhenyang Xiao*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations due to the high demand on GPU\nmemory and computational resources when handling long contexts. While sparsify\nthe Key-Value (KV) cache of transformer model is a typical strategy to\nalleviate resource usage, it unavoidably results in the loss of information. We\nintroduce Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), a novel approach that\nenables lossless compression of the KV cache, thereby reducing the memory and\ncomputational demands during autoregressive generation. LoMA incorporates a\nspecialized training or fine-tuning precedure alongside an autoregressive\ngeneration algorithm optimized for the compressed context. Our method\ncompresses the KV cache after every $tc$ generated tokens with a compression\nratio of $c$ and a target compressed length $t$, and this process occurs within\na single inference pass without dependency on auxiliary models. We engineered\nan efficient training scheme involving specific inputs, attention masks, and\nposition identifiers to instill this compression capability. Experimental\nvalidation has demonstrated that LoMA significantly reducing computational\nconsumption and memory usage through achieving lossless KV cache compression.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-16T09:18:46Z  (*Updated: 2024-02-04T03:14:08Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Compressed Context Memory For Online Language Model Interaction\n\n*From Search Query: \"Memory Compression in Transformers\"*\n\n*Jang-Hyun Kim, Junyoung Yeom, Sangdoo Yun, Hyun Oh Song*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a context key/value compression method for Transformer\nlanguage models in online scenarios, where the context continually expands. As\nthe context lengthens, the attention process demands increasing memory and\ncomputations, which in turn reduces the throughput of the language model. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a compressed context memory system that\ncontinually compresses the accumulating attention key/value pairs into a\ncompact memory space, facilitating language model inference in a limited memory\nspace of computing environments. Our compression process involves integrating a\nlightweight conditional LoRA into the language model's forward pass during\ninference, without the need for fine-tuning the model's entire set of weights.\nWe achieve efficient training by modeling the recursive compression process as\na single parallelized forward computation. Through evaluations on conversation,\npersonalization, and multi-task learning, we demonstrate that our approach\nachieves the performance level of a full context model with $5\\times$ smaller\ncontext memory size.

Treeformer: Dense Gradient Trees for Efficient Attention Computation\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Long-Range Attention\"*\n\n*Lovish Madaan, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Himanshu Jain, Prateek Jain*\n\n**Abstract:** Standard inference and training with transformer based architectures scale\nquadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a\nvariety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering\netc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup\nattention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as\nsparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we\nview attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use\ndecision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per\nquery token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such\nhierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two\nefficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention\ncomputes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse\nattention layer which also ensures that the gradients are \"dense\". To optimize\nsuch challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training\nmethod. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for\nlong-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost\nas accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the\nattention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12%\nhigher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-18T18:31:40Z  (*Updated: 2023-03-17T14:25:43Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Visual Attention Network\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive Linear Attention\"*\n\n*Shi-Min Hu, Ming-Ming Cheng, Zheng-Ning Liu, Cheng-Ze Lu, Meng-Hao Guo*\n\n**Abstract:** While originally designed for natural language processing tasks, the self-attention mechanism has recently taken various computer vision areas by storm. However, the 2D nature of images brings three challenges for applying self-attention in computer vision. (1) Treating images as 1D sequences neglects their 2D structures. (2) The quadratic complexity is too expensive for high-resolution images. (3) It only captures spatial adaptability but ignores channel adaptability. In this paper, we propose a novel linear attention named large kernel attention (LKA) to enable self-adaptive and long-range correlations in self-attention while avoiding its shortcomings. Furthermore, we present a neural network based on LKA, namely Visual Attention Network (VAN). While extremely simple, VAN surpasses similar size vision transformers(ViTs) and convolutional neural networks(CNNs) in various tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation, pose estimation, etc. For example, VAN-B6 achieves 87.8% accuracy on ImageNet benchmark and set new state-of-the-art performance (58.2 PQ) for panoptic segmentation. Besides, VAN-B2 surpasses Swin-T 4% mIoU (50.1 vs. 46.1) for semantic segmentation on ADE20K benchmark, 2.6% AP (48.8 vs. 46.2) for object detection on COCO dataset.

Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive Linear Attention\"*\n\n*Baining Guo, Stephen Lin, Zheng Zhang, Yixuan Wei, Han Hu, Yue Cao, Yutong Lin, Ze Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \\textbf{S}hifted \\textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

Memory AMP\n\n*From Search Query: \"Memory Compression in Transformers\"*\n\n*Brian M. Kurkoski, Shunqi Huang, Lei Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Approximate message passing (AMP) is a low-cost iterative parameter-estimation technique for certain high-dimensional linear systems with non-Gaussian distributions. AMP only applies to independent identically distributed (IID) transform matrices, but may become unreliable (e.g., perform poorly or even diverge) for other matrix ensembles, especially for ill-conditioned ones. To solve this issue, orthogonal/vector AMP (OAMP/VAMP) was proposed for general right-unitarily-invariant matrices. However, the Bayes-optimal OAMP/VAMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) requires a high-complexity linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator. This prevents OAMP/VAMP from being used in large-scale systems. To address the drawbacks of AMP and BO-OAMP/VAMP, this paper offers a memory AMP (MAMP) framework based on the orthogonality principle, which ensures that estimation errors in MAMP are asymptotically IID Gaussian. To realize the required orthogonality for MAMP, we provide an orthogonalization procedure for the local memory estimators. In addition, we propose a Bayes-optimal MAMP (BO-MAMP), in which a long-memory matched filter is used for interference suppression. The complexity of BO-MAMP is comparable to AMP. To asymptotically characterize the performance of BO-MAMP, a state evolution is derived. The relaxation parameters and damping vector in BO-MAMP are optimized based on state evolution. Most crucially, the state evolution of the optimized BO-MAMP converges to the same fixed point as that of the high-complexity BO-OAMP/VAMP for all right-unitarily-invariant matrices, and achieves the Bayes optimal MSE predicted by the replica method if its state evolution has a unique fixed point. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the theoretical results' validity and accuracy.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-20\n\n\n\n#### 5. Efficient Long-Range Attention Network for Image Super-resolution\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Long-Range Attention\"*\n\n*Lei Zhang, Shi Guo, Hui Zeng, Xindong Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, transformer-based methods have demonstrated impressive results in various vision tasks, including image super-resolution (SR), by exploiting the self-attention (SA) for feature extraction. However, the computation of SA in most existing transformer based models is very expensive, while some employed operations may be redundant for the SR task. This limits the range of SA computation and consequently the SR performance. In this work, we propose an efficient long-range attention network (ELAN) for image SR. Specifically, we first employ shift convolution (shift-conv) to effectively extract the image local structural information while maintaining the same level of complexity as 1x1 convolution, then propose a group-wise multi-scale self-attention (GMSA) module, which calculates SA on non-overlapped groups of features using different window sizes to exploit the long-range image dependency. A highly efficient long-range attention block (ELAB) is then built by simply cascading two shift-conv with a GMSA module, which is further accelerated by using a shared attention mechanism. Without bells and whistles, our ELAN follows a fairly simple design by sequentially cascading the ELABs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ELAN obtains even better results against the transformer-based SR models but with significantly less complexity.

Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher enhance the **FastTTTLinear** model with advanced attention mechanisms that combine efficiency, adaptive capabilities, and memory compression, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n### Adaptive Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The concept of adaptive attention span, as mentioned in the analysis note, is crucial. While the exact references provided in the analysis note are not available, the idea is to dynamically adjust the attention span based on the input sequence. This can be achieved through mechanisms like those described in the context of Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs).\n\n### Memory Compression Techniques\n\n- **Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs):** This approach involves learning a network for memory management that focuses on the most relevant information for individual layers and attention heads. NAMMs condition exclusively on the values in the produced attention matrices, allowing for significant reductions in the model\u2019s input contexts without sacrificing performance. This method is universally applicable to any model using self-attention and has been shown to improve performance and efficiency across multiple long-context tasks.\n\n### Efficient Long-Range Attention\n\n- **Context-Aware Adaptive Sparse Attention with Key-Value cache compression (CASAK-V):** This method dynamically generates sparse attention patterns and compresses the Key-Value cache, which is particularly useful for memory-efficient long-context modeling. CASAK-V can be integrated into existing models to enhance their scalability and effectiveness on long-range dependencies without significant performance degradation.\n\n### Integration with FastTTTLinear\n\n- **Combining Adaptive and Compressed Attention:**\n  - Integrating adaptive attention mechanisms, such as those in NAMMs or CASAK-V, into **FastTTTLinear** could allow the model to dynamically adjust its attention span and compress memory usage. This would maintain the computational benefits of linear attention while efficiently handling long sequences.\n  - For example, using NAMMs to manage the latent memory KV cache could enable **FastTTTLinear** to focus on the most relevant information for each layer and attention head, reducing the overall memory footprint and computational cost.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Memory-Augmented Transformers (Memformers):** While primarily focused on implementing linear first-order optimization methods, Memformers demonstrate the capability of Transformers to handle complex optimization tasks efficiently.

These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/35 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAlbert Gu, Karan Goel, and Christopher R\u00e9. 2021.

Never Train from Scratch: Fair Comparison of Long-Sequence Models Requires Data-Driven Priors (Avg.

However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using $\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/31 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/1804.03209, 2018.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 21 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\", \"State Space Models in Transformers\", \"Efficient Long-Sequence Modeling\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Our model has two distinctive characteristics: (i) it has a hierarchical structure that mirrors the hierarchical structure of documents; (ii) it has two levels of attention mechanisms applied at the wordand sentence-level, enabling it to attend differentially to more and less important content when constructing the document representation. Experiments conducted on six large scale text classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperform previous methods by a substantial margin.

Collective Event Detection via a Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\"*\n\n*Yubo Chen, Hang Yang, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao, Yantao Jia*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively and a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information to solve the two problems simultaneously.\n\n**Abstract:** Traditional approaches to the task of ACE event detection primarily regard multiple events in one sentence as independent ones and recognize them separately by using sentence-level information. However, events in one sentence are usually interdependent and sentence-level information is often insufficient to resolve ambiguities for some types of events. This paper proposes a novel framework dubbed as Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms (HBTNGMA) to solve the two problems simultaneously. Firstly, we propose a hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively. Then, we devise a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information. The experimental results on the widely used ACE 2005 dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 101  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 3. Reading Turn by Turn: Hierarchical Attention Architecture for Spoken Dialogue Comprehension\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\"*\n\n*Zhengyuan Liu, Nancy F. Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a hierarchical attention neural network architecture, combining turn-level and word-level attention mechanisms, to improve spoken dialogue comprehension performance, and empirically shows that the proposed approach outperforms standard attention baselines, achieves more efficient learning outcomes, and is more robust to lengthy and out-of-distribution test samples.\n\n**Abstract:** Comprehending multi-turn spoken conversations is an emerging research area, presenting challenges different from reading comprehension of passages due to the interactive nature of information exchange from at least two speakers. Unlike passages, where sentences are often the default semantic modeling unit, in multi-turn conversations, a turn is a topically coherent unit embodied with immediately relevant context, making it a linguistically intuitive segment for computationally modeling verbal interactions. Therefore, in this work, we propose a hierarchical attention neural network architecture, combining turn-level and word-level attention mechanisms, to improve spoken dialogue comprehension performance. Experiments are conducted on a multi-turn conversation dataset, where nurses inquire and discuss symptom information with patients. We empirically show that the proposed approach outperforms standard attention baselines, achieves more efficient learning outcomes, and is more robust to lengthy and out-of-distribution test samples.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Repeat After Me: Transformers are Better than State Space Models at Copying\n\n*From Search Query: \"State Space Models in Transformers\"*\n\n*Samy Jelassi, David Brandfonbrener, S. Kakade, Eran Malach*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state, and a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest is suggested.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, but there is growing interest in models that use a fixed-size latent state that does not depend on the sequence length, which we refer to as\"generalized state space models\"(GSSMs). In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 5. Structured State Space Models for In-Context Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"State Space Models in Transformers\"*\n\n*Chris Xiaoxuan Lu, Yannick Schroecker, Albert Gu, Emilio Parisotto, J. Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"State Space Models in Transformers\"*\n\n*Albert Gu, Ankit Gupta, Karan Goel, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically describes various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and performs a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 212  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 7. Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Long-Sequence Modeling\"*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 8. SMR: State Memory Replay for Long Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Long-Sequence Modeling\"*\n\n*Biqing Qi, Junqi Gao, Kaiyan Zhang, Dong Li, Jianxing Liu, Ligang Wu, Bowen Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel non-recursive non-uniform sample processing strategy, State Memory Replay (SMR), which utilizes learnable memories to adjust the current state with multi-step information for generalization at sampling points different from those in the training data, enables SSMs to stably model varying sampling points.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the promising performance of state space models (SSMs) in long sequence modeling, limitations still exist. Advanced SSMs like S5 and S6 (Mamba) in addressing non-uniform sampling, their recursive structures impede efficient SSM computation via convolution. To overcome compatibility limitations in parallel convolutional computation, this paper proposes a novel non-recursive non-uniform sample processing strategy. Theoretical analysis of SSMs through the lens of Event-Triggered Control (ETC) theory reveals the Non-Stable State (NSS) problem, where deviations from sampling point requirements lead to error transmission and accumulation, causing the divergence of the SSM's hidden state. Our analysis further reveals that adjustments of input sequences with early memories can mitigate the NSS problem, achieving Sampling Step Adaptation (SSA). Building on this insight, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play mechanism, State Memory Replay (SMR), which utilizes learnable memories to adjust the current state with multi-step information for generalization at sampling points different from those in the training data. This enables SSMs to stably model varying sampling points. Experiments on long-range modeling tasks in autoregressive language modeling and Long Range Arena demonstrate the general effectiveness of the SMR mechanism for a series of SSM models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. CAB: Comprehensive Attention Benchmarking on Long Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Long-Sequence Modeling\"*\n\n*Jinchao Zhang, Shuyang Jiang, Jiangtao Feng, Lin Zheng, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Comprehensive Attention Benchmark (CAB) under a fine-grained attention taxonomy with four distinguishable attention patterns, namely, noncausal self, causal self,Noncausal cross, and causal cross attentions, and sheds light on the fundamental problems of efficient attentions.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer has achieved remarkable success in language, image, and speech processing. Recently, various efficient attention architectures have been proposed to improve transformer's efficiency while largely preserving its efficacy, especially in modeling long sequences. A widely-used benchmark to test these efficient methods' capability on long-range modeling is Long Range Arena (LRA). However, LRA only focuses on the standard bidirectional (or noncausal) self attention, and completely ignores cross attentions and unidirectional (or causal) attentions, which are equally important to downstream applications. In this paper, we propose Comprehensive Attention Benchmark (CAB) under a fine-grained attention taxonomy with four distinguishable attention patterns, namely, noncausal self, causal self, noncausal cross, and causal cross attentions. CAB collects seven real-world tasks from different research areas to evaluate efficient attentions under the four attention patterns. Among these tasks, CAB validates efficient attentions in eight backbone networks to show their generalization across neural architectures. We conduct exhaustive experiments to benchmark the performances of nine widely-used efficient attention architectures designed with different philosophies on CAB. Extensive experimental results also shed light on the fundamental problems of efficient attentions, such as efficiency length against vanilla attention, performance consistency across attention patterns, the benefit of attention mechanisms, and interpolation/extrapolation on long-context language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Block-State Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"State Space Models in Transformers\"*\n\n*Mahan Fathi, Jonathan Pilault, Orhan Firat, Christopher Pal, Pierre-Luc Bacon, Ross Goroshin*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have shown impressive results on tasks that require\nmodeling long-range dependencies and efficiently scale to long sequences owing\nto their subquadratic runtime complexity. Originally designed for continuous\nsignals, SSMs have shown superior performance on a plethora of tasks, in vision\nand audio; however, SSMs still lag Transformer performance in Language Modeling\ntasks.

Building an Efficiency Pipeline: Commutativity and Cumulativeness of\n  Efficiency Operators for Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Long-Sequence Modeling\"*\n\n*Ji Xin, Raphael Tang, Zhiying Jiang, Yaoliang Yu, Jimmy Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** There exists a wide variety of efficiency methods for natural language\nprocessing (NLP) tasks, such as pruning, distillation, dynamic inference,\nquantization, etc. We can consider an efficiency method as an operator applied\non a model. Naturally, we may construct a pipeline of multiple efficiency\nmethods, i.e., to apply multiple operators on the model sequentially. In this\npaper, we study the plausibility of this idea, and more importantly, the\ncommutativity and cumulativeness of efficiency operators. We make two\ninteresting observations: (1) Efficiency operators are commutative -- the order\nof efficiency methods within the pipeline has little impact on the final\nresults; (2) Efficiency operators are also cumulative -- the final results of\ncombining several efficiency methods can be estimated by combining the results\nof individual methods.

Learnable Multi-level Frequency Decomposition and Hierarchical Attention Mechanism for Generalized Face Presentation Attack Detection\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\"*\n\n*Arjan Kuijper, Florian Kirchbuchner, Naser Damer, Meiling Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** With the increased deployment of face recognition systems in our daily lives, face presentation attack detection (PAD) is attracting much attention and playing a key role in securing face recognition systems. Despite the great performance achieved by the hand-crafted and deep-learning-based methods in intra-dataset evaluations, the performance drops when dealing with unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose a dual-stream convolution neural networks (CNNs) framework. One stream adapts four learnable frequency filters to learn features in the frequency domain, which are less influenced by variations in sensors/illuminations. The other stream leverages the RGB images to complement the features of the frequency domain. Moreover, we propose a hierarchical attention module integration to join the information from the two streams at different stages by considering the nature of deep features in different layers of the CNN. The proposed method is evaluated in the intra-dataset and cross-dataset setups, and the results demonstrate that our proposed approach enhances the generalizability in most experimental setups in comparison to state-of-the-art, including the methods designed explicitly for domain adaption/shift problems. We successfully prove the design of our proposed PAD solution in a step-wise ablation study that involves our proposed learnable frequency decomposition, our hierarchical attention module design, and the used loss function.

Bidirectional Attention Flow for Machine Comprehension\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\"*\n\n*Ali Farhadi, Minjoon Seo, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Aniruddha Kembhavi*\n\n**Abstract:** Machine comprehension (MC), answering a query about a given context\nparagraph, requires modeling complex interactions between the context and the\nquery.

However, the enormous computational demands of this architecture have deterred many researchers. To further reduce the complexity of attention models, numerous efforts have been made to design more efficient methods. Among them, the State Space Model (SSM), as a possible replacement for the self-attention based Transformer model, has drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this paper, we give the first comprehensive review of these works and also provide experimental comparisons and analysis to better demonstrate the features and advantages of SSM. Specifically, we first give a detailed description of principles to help the readers quickly capture the key ideas of SSM. After that, we dive into the reviews of existing SSMs and their various applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, graph, multi-modal and multi-media, point cloud/event stream, time series data, and other domains. In addition, we give statistical comparisons and analysis of these models and hope it helps the readers to understand the effectiveness of different structures on various tasks.

Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Long-Sequence Modeling\"*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Karan Goel, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of $10000$ or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) \\( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \\), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix \\( A \\), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning \\( A \\) with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91\\% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation $60\\times$ faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors.\n\n**Conference:** efficiently-modeling-long-sequences-with\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-31\n\n\n\n#### 6. Dual-path RNN: efficient long sequence modeling for time-domain single-channel speech separation\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Long-Sequence Modeling\"*\n\n*Zhuo Chen, Yi Luo, Takuya Yoshioka*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent studies in deep learning-based speech separation have proven the superiority of time-domain approaches to conventional time-frequency-based methods. Unlike the time-frequency domain approaches, the time-domain separation systems often receive input sequences consisting of a huge number of time steps, which introduces challenges for modeling extremely long sequences. Conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are not effective for modeling such long sequences due to optimization difficulties, while one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1-D CNNs) cannot perform utterance-level sequence modeling when its receptive field is smaller than the sequence length. In this paper, we propose dual-path recurrent neural network (DPRNN), a simple yet effective method for organizing RNN layers in a deep structure to model extremely long sequences. DPRNN splits the long sequential input into smaller chunks and applies intra- and inter-chunk operations iteratively, where the input length can be made proportional to the square root of the original sequence length in each operation. Experiments show that by replacing 1-D CNN with DPRNN and apply sample-level modeling in the time-domain audio separation network (TasNet), a new state-of-the-art performance on WSJ0-2mix is achieved with a 20 times smaller model than the previous best system.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-14\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates state-space models with attention mechanisms, particularly for efficient long-sequence modeling, here are the key insights and relevant information from the provided sources:\n\n### Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN):**\n  - HANs are designed to capture the hierarchical structure of data, such as documents or sentences, using two levels of attention: word-level and sentence-level. This approach allows the model to weigh the importance of words within sentences and sentences within documents, which can be adapted for processing sequences at multiple scales.\n\n- **Nova's Hierarchical Attention:**\n  - The Nova model uses a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that captures semantics at three granularity levels: intra-instruction, preceding-instruction, and inter-instruction attention. This hierarchical approach can be a blueprint for designing attention mechanisms that handle long sequences efficiently by breaking down the sequence into manageable parts.\n\n### State Space Models (SSMs)\n\n- **Structured State Space for Sequence Modeling (S4):**\n  - S4 combines state-space models with deep learning to model long sequences with linear computational complexity. This approach can be integrated into Transformers to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. The state-space representation can compactly encode the entire history of the sequence, which is beneficial for handling long sequences.\n\n### Integration with FastTTTLinear\n\n- **Hierarchical Structure:**\n  - Implementing a hierarchical structure where **FastTTTLinear** operates at the local level within chunks and introduces an additional layer or mechanism to handle global attention across chunks. This can be done by using compressed representations or summary tokens to reduce computational complexity.\n\n- **State-Space Integration:**\n  - Incorporate SSM components to maintain a global state that summarizes past information. Modify **FastTTTLinear** to interact with these state representations, using them to inform the attention mechanism. This integration can leverage the linear complexity of SSMs to handle long sequences efficiently.\n\n### Efficient Long-Sequence Modeling\n\n- **Global and Local Attention:**\n  - A hybrid approach combining global and local attention mechanisms can be effective. Global attention captures long-range dependencies, while local attention focuses on detailed features. This balance can be crucial for tasks requiring both comprehensive context understanding and detailed local information.\n\n- **Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention:**\n  - This mechanism replaces softmax attention with a gated mechanism incorporating a moving average, allowing the model to capture long-range dependencies with linear time and space complexity. This can be adapted to enhance **FastTTTLinear**'s ability to handle long sequences efficiently.\n\n### Practical Implementation\n\n- **Computational Efficiency:**\n  - When integrating hierarchical or state-space components, it is crucial to evaluate the computational and memory overhead. Ensuring that the modifications do not introduce significant bottlenecks is essential for maintaining the model's efficiency.\n\n### Key References\n\n- **Nova's Hierarchical Attention:** The paper on Nova provides a detailed implementation of hierarchical self-attention that can be adapted for general sequence modeling tasks.\n- **Hierarchical Attention Networks:** The Restackio article on HANs offers insights into how hierarchical attention can be structured to capture both local and global dependencies.\n- **Structured State Space for Sequence Modeling:** While not explicitly mentioned in the sources, the concept of SSMs like S4 can be integrated based on the principles outlined in the literature on state-space models and their application in deep learning.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo enhance **FastTTTLinear**'s ability to handle long sequences efficiently, integrating hierarchical attention mechanisms and state-space models is a promising approach. By leveraging hierarchical attention to process sequences at multiple scales and using state-space representations to capture long-range dependencies, the model can achieve better performance and scalability. The Mega attention mechanism and the principles of SSMs provide additional avenues to improve efficiency and capture temporal dynamics over long sequences.\n",

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios.

Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/86 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nY. Fu, et al. 2023; De et al. 2024; Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024) suggests that a hybrid architecture with both SSM layers and attention layers could improve the model quality over that of a Transformer, or a pure SSM (e.g., Mamba) model, especially for in-context learning. We explore the different ways that SSD layers can be combined with attention and MLP to understand the benefits of each. Empirically we find that having around $10 \\%$ of the total number of layers being attention performs best. Combining SSD layers, attention layers, and MLP also works better than either pure Transformer++ or Mamba-2. SSD and Attention We find that SSD and attention layers are complementary: by themselves (e.g. in the Mamba-2 architecture vs. Transformer++) their performance (measured by perplexity) is nearly the same, but a mixture of SSD and attention layers outperforms the pure Mamba-2 or Transformer++ architecture. We show some results (Table 2) for the 350 M model ( 48 layers) trained to 7B tokens on the Pile with the GPT- 2 tokenizer (same number of parameters, same hyperparameters, same training and validation set). Adding in just a few attention layers already yields notable improvement and strikes the best balance between quality and efficiency. We hypothesize that the SSM layers function well as a general sequence-to-sequence mapping, and attention layers act as a retrieval mechanism to quickly refer to previous tokens in the sequence instead of forcing the model to compress all the context to its memory (SSM states). Table 2: (Combining SSD and Attention Blocks.) Perplexity of a 350 M model with 48 layers, with different number of attention layers. Having around a $10 \\%$ ratio of attention layers performs best. | Num. AtTn Blocks | 0 (Mamba-2) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 9 | 11 | 15 | 24 | Transformer++ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Perplexity $\\downarrow$ | 8.60 | 8.38 | 8.32 | 8.29 | 8.29 | 8.28 | $\\mathbf{8 . 2 6}$ | 8.27 | 8.28 | 8.30 | 8.34 | 8.50 | 8.68 |\n\nHybrid Models with SSD, MLP, and Attention We compare different ways that SSD can be combined with the (gated) MLP and attention layers, and evaluate at the 2.7B scale (64 layers), trained to 300B tokens on the Pile (same number of parameters, same hyperparameters, same training and validation set, same data order):\n\n1. Transformer++: 32 attention layers and 32 gated MLP, interleaving. 2. Mamba-2: 64 SSD layers. 3. Mamba-2-MLP: 32 SSD and 32 gated MLP layers, interleaving. 4. Mamba-2-Attention: 58 SSD layers and 6 attention layers (at indices $9,18,27,36,45,56)^{6}$. 5. Mamba-2-MLP-Attention: 28 SSD layers and 4 attention layers, interleaving with 32 gated MLP layers. We report the validation perplexity on the Pile, as well as zero-shot evaluation, in Table 3. In general, the quality of Transformer++ and Mamba-2 models are around the same. We see that adding just 6 attention layers noticeably improves over the pure Mamba-2 model (and over Transformer++). Adding MLP layers reduces model quality, but can (i) speed up training and inference due to the simplicity and hardware-efficiency of the MLP layer (ii) be easier to up-cycle to MoE models by replacing MLP layers with mixture-of-experts.

SSD, thanks to its reformulation to use matrix multiplication as a subroutine, can exploit specialized matrix multiplication (matmul) units on GPUs, also known as tensor cores. As a result, it is 2-8\u00d7 faster than Mamba's fused associative scan, which does not leverage matmul units. Due to its linear scaling in sequence length, SSD is faster than FlashAttention-2 starting at sequence length $2 K$. However, we note that the Mamba-2 model as a whole might not be as efficient to train as Transformer at short sequence length (e.g. at $2 K$ ), since a Transformer with $L$ layers would have $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ attention layers, while a Mamba- 2 model would have $L$ SSD layers for the same number of parameters. Generally the MLP layers are very hardware efficient since they consist of simple matrix multiplication and pointwise linearity. As shown in Section 9.2.3, one can also combine $\\frac{L}{2}$ SSD layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers to speed up training at short sequence length. [^4]Table 4: (Ablations: Mamba-2 block.) We ablate the major differences between the Mamba-2 and Mamba-1 neural network blocks (Figure 6, Section 7.1). Note that these components are independent of the inner sequence mixing layer; in these ablations, we use SSD for the inner SSM layer (differing from the S6 layer of Mamba-1). | Block | ABCX Projections | Extra Normalization | Parameters | Perplexity |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Mamba-1 | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 129.3 M | 11.76 |\n|  | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 129.3 M | 11.54 |\n|  | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 126.5 M | 11.66 |\n| Mamba-2 | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 126.5 M | 11.49 |\n\n### 9.4 Architecture Ablations\n\n### 9.4.1 Block Design\n\nSection 7.1 introduces the Mamba-2 block, which has small modifications to the Mamba-1 block which are partly motivated by the connection to attention and also to improve the scalability of Mamba-2. Table 4 ablates these architecture changes to the block, which occur outside of the core SSM layer. The ablations validate that parallel projections to create $(A, B, C, X)$ saves parameters and performs slightly better than Mamba's sequential projections. More importantly, this modification is amenable to tensor parallelism at larger model sizes (Section 8). Additionally, the extra normalization layer also slightly improves performance. More importantly, preliminary experiments at larger scales observed that it also helps with training stability. ### 9.4.2 Head Structure\n\nSection 7.2 describes how the dimensions of the $B, C, X$ projections can be viewed as a hyperparameter analogous to notions of multi-head attention and multi-query attention. We also showed how the original Mamba architecture is analogous to multi-value attention (Proposition 7.2), which was a choice that naturally developed from the state-space model point of view and was not previously ablated. Table 5 ablates choices of the multi-head structure for the Mamba-2 architecture. Strikingly, we find a large difference between multi-value and multi-query or multi-key head patterns, despite seeming very similar. Note that this is not explained by the total state size, which is the same for all of them (equal to HPN or the product of the number of heads, head dimension, and state dimension). We also compare to multi-head patterns where the number of $C, B, X$ (analogous to $Q, K, V$ ) heads is equal. We compare against the standard multi-head pattern, as well as one with aggressive sharing where they all have only 1 head. Note that in the latter case, the model still has H different sequence mixers $M$, because each head still has a different $A$. When parameter matched, these multi-head patterns perform similarly to each other, in between the MVA and MQA/MKA patterns. ### 9.4.3 Attention Kernel Approximations\n\nSection 7.3 noted how SSD can be combined with ideas from the linear attention literature, such as various forms of kernel approximations. We ablate several variants of these suggested by previous works in Table 6. These include the cosFormer (Qin, Weixuan Sun, et al. 2022), Random Feature Attention H. Peng et al. 2021, and Positive Random Features (Performer) (Choromanski et al. 2021). We also ablate adding a normalization term, akin to the denominator of the softmax function in standard attention. We found that this introduced instabilities to most variants, but slightly improved performance for the ReLU activation function $\\psi$. Table 7 also tests more recent proposals to improve linear attention that involve expanding the feature dimension (Based (Arora, Eyuboglu, Zhang, et al. 2024) and ReBased (Aksenov et al. 2024)). These linear attention extensions aim to appropriate the $\\exp$ kernel with a quadratic approximation. ReBased also proposes to replace the QK activation function with a layer normalization; from an SSM-centric view we apply a normalization on top of $(B, C)$ before applying the SSM function. Table 5: (Ablations: Multi-head structure.) All models have state expansion factor $N=64$ and head size $P=64$ and are trained to Chinchilla scaling law token counts. The number of $A$ heads is always equal to the total heads H , i.e. each head has a separate input-dependent $A$ decay factor.

Overall, Table 6 and Table 7 found that the kernel approximation methods we tried did not seem to improve over simple pointwise non-linear activation functions for $\\psi$. Thus our default settings for Mamba-2 used $\\psi(x)=$ Swish $(x)$ to follow Mamba-1, but we suggest that removing this activation entirely may be a simpler choice that we did not extensively test. We emphasize however that SSD and vanilla linear attention differ in the inclusion of the 1-semiseparable mask $L$, while the various linear attention methods in the literature were derived to approximate softmax attention without this term; thus, our negative results may be not unexpected. ## 10 Related Work and Discussion\n\nThe state space duality framework bridges connections between SSMs, structured matrices, and attention. We discuss in more depth the relations between SSD and these concepts more broadly. Using ideas from each of the viewpoints, we also suggest some directions that the SSD framework can be extended in future work. ### 10.1 State Space Models\n\nStructured state space models can be characterized along the axes\n(i) whether it is time-invariant or time-varying.\n```\n\n#### 4.

These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to design a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates **State Space Models (SSMs)** and **hierarchical attention mechanisms** to enhance the efficiency and performance of the existing FastTTTLinear model, particularly in handling long sequences. Here are the key points and the most useful information to help achieve this goal:\n\n### Integration of State Space Models\n\n- **SPADE Approach**:\n  - The SPADE model integrates an SSM into the bottom layer of a Transformer to capture global information efficiently. This approach complements local attention mechanisms in higher layers, which is a promising strategy for FastTTTLinear.\n  - **Key Insight**: SSMs handle long-range dependencies with linear complexity, which can significantly improve the model's performance on long sequences.\n\n- **Mamba and DenseMamba**:\n  - Mamba and DenseMamba focus on enhancing the selectivity and flow of hidden information in SSMs. These models balance efficiency and effectiveness by selectively integrating shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers.\n  - **Key Insight**: Applying similar techniques to FastTTTLinear can improve its ability to retain and utilize critical information across layers.\n\n### Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN)**:\n  - HANs use a hierarchical structure with attention mechanisms at multiple levels (e.g., word and sentence levels). This allows the model to focus on different levels of granularity, capturing both local and global information.\n  - **Key Insight**: Implementing a hierarchical attention mechanism within FastTTTLinear can process sequences at multiple scales, improving efficiency and performance.\n\n- **Block-State Transformers (BST)**:\n  - BST combines an SSM sublayer for long-range contextualization with a block Transformer sublayer for short-term representation. This hybrid approach efficiently models both global and local dependencies.\n  - **Key Insight**: Adapting the BST concept to FastTTTLinear can help in blending state-space models and attention mechanisms effectively.\n\n### Efficient Long-Sequence Modeling\n\n- **Structured State Spaces (S4)**:\n  - S4 models sequences using SSMs with tailored state matrices, achieving linear computational complexity. This model demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring modeling long-range dependencies.\n  - **Key Insight**: Utilizing the principles of S4 can enhance FastTTTLinear's capability in modeling long sequences efficiently.\n\n### Practical Considerations\n\n- **Implementation Complexity**:\n  - Integrating SSMs with attention mechanisms requires careful design to ensure stability and efficiency. Modifications should remain localized to comply with project constraints.\n  - **Key Insight**: Detailed analysis of SPADE and Mamba implementations can provide insights into efficient integration strategies.\n\n- **Balancing Local and Global Dependencies**:\n  - Combining SSMs for global context and attention mechanisms for local details necessitates an effective integration strategy. Ensuring the model does not become overly complex or computationally intensive is crucial.\n  - **Key Insight**: The BiMamba module, which processes sequences in both directions and combines outputs, can serve as a model for balancing local and global dependencies.\n\n### Relevant Techniques and Architectures\n\n- **State Space Duality (SSD)**:\n  - SSD simplifies the matrix A into a scalar, which can be applied in both linear and quadratic forms. This simplification can enhance the adaptability and performance of SSMs.\n  - **Key Insight**: Applying SSD can simplify the integration of SSMs into FastTTTLinear.\n\n- **Linear Attention Mechanisms and Sparse Attention**:\n  - These mechanisms reduce the complexity of attention calculations, allowing for faster processing of longer sequences. They can be integrated alongside SSMs to further optimize performance.\n  - **Key Insight**: Incorporating linear attention mechanisms or sparse attention can mitigate the quadratic scaling issue of traditional transformers.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- **Deep Dive into Implementations**:\n  - Examine the detailed architectures and training methodologies of SPADE, Mamba, and BST to understand how they efficiently integrate SSMs with attention mechanisms.\n  - Plan how to modify FastTTTLinear while keeping changes localized and ensuring compatibility with the existing structure.\n\n- **Explore Hierarchical Attention Integration**:\n  - Investigate practical approaches to implement hierarchical attention within the constraints of FastTTTLinear. Consider how chunking or segmenting sequences can be efficiently managed.\n\nBy focusing on these key points, the researcher can develop a concrete proposal for integrating SSMs and hierarchical attention mechanisms into FastTTTLinear, ensuring that the modifications are efficient, scalable, and aligned with the project's guidelines.\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

By placing the SSM at a strategic point within the GAU, we can capture global context without significantly increasing computational complexity.\n\n#### **Balancing SSM Layers and Attention Layers**\n\n- Research suggests that having a mix of SSM layers and attention layers yields better performance than using only one of them.\n\n- For instance, **Dao and Gu (2024)** found that incorporating around 10% of attention layers in an otherwise SSM-based model (Mamba-2) improved performance.\n\n- **Key Insight:** Modifying **FastTTTLinear** to include a small attention mechanism or layer alongside the SSM component could enhance its performance without violating the constraint of local modifications.\n\n#### **State Space Duality (SSD) Framework**\n\n- The SSD framework highlights the close relationship between transformers and SSMs, providing a theoretical basis for integrating them.\n\n- **Key Insight:** Utilizing the SSD framework can guide the integration of SSMs into **FastTTTLinear**, ensuring that the modifications are mathematically sound and efficient.\n\n#### **Hierarchical Approaches and Short-Long Convolutions**\n\n- Models like **CHELA** use hierarchical structures and combine short-long convolutions to capture both local and global dependencies.\n\n- **Key Insight:** Implementing a hierarchical attention mechanism within **FastTTTLinear** can enable it to process sequences at multiple scales, improving efficiency in modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n#### **Implementation Considerations**\n\n- **Localizing Changes:** Modifications should be confined within **FastTTTLinear** to adhere to the project's constraints.\n\n- **Computational Efficiency:** Any added components, such as an SSM layer or additional attention mechanism, should maintain or improve computational efficiency.\n\n- **Training Stability:** Care must be taken to ensure that integrating SSMs does not introduce instability during training.\n\n### 4.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 25  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nY. Fu, et al. 2023; De et al. 2024; Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024) suggests that a hybrid architecture with both SSM layers and attention layers could improve the model quality over that of a Transformer, or a pure SSM (e.g., Mamba) model, especially for in-context learning. We explore the different ways that SSD layers can be combined with attention and MLP to understand the benefits of each. Empirically we find that having around $10 \\%$ of the total number of layers being attention performs best. Combining SSD layers, attention layers, and MLP also works better than either pure Transformer++ or Mamba-2. SSD and Attention We find that SSD and attention layers are complementary: by themselves (e.g. in the Mamba-2 architecture vs. Transformer++) their performance (measured by perplexity) is nearly the same, but a mixture of SSD and attention layers outperforms the pure Mamba-2 or Transformer++ architecture. We show some results (Table 2) for the 350 M model ( 48 layers) trained to 7B tokens on the Pile with the GPT- 2 tokenizer (same number of parameters, same hyperparameters, same training and validation set). Adding in just a few attention layers already yields notable improvement and strikes the best balance between quality and efficiency. We hypothesize that the SSM layers function well as a general sequence-to-sequence mapping, and attention layers act as a retrieval mechanism to quickly refer to previous tokens in the sequence instead of forcing the model to compress all the context to its memory (SSM states). Table 2: (Combining SSD and Attention Blocks.) Perplexity of a 350 M model with 48 layers, with different number of attention layers. Having around a $10 \\%$ ratio of attention layers performs best. | Num.

Transformer++: 32 attention layers and 32 gated MLP, interleaving. 2. Mamba-2: 64 SSD layers. 3. Mamba-2-MLP: 32 SSD and 32 gated MLP layers, interleaving. 4. Mamba-2-Attention: 58 SSD layers and 6 attention layers (at indices $9,18,27,36,45,56)^{6}$. 5. Mamba-2-MLP-Attention: 28 SSD layers and 4 attention layers, interleaving with 32 gated MLP layers. We report the validation perplexity on the Pile, as well as zero-shot evaluation, in Table 3. In general, the quality of Transformer++ and Mamba-2 models are around the same. We see that adding just 6 attention layers noticeably improves over the pure Mamba-2 model (and over Transformer++). Adding MLP layers reduces model quality, but can (i) speed up training and inference due to the simplicity and hardware-efficiency of the MLP layer (ii) be easier to up-cycle to MoE models by replacing MLP layers with mixture-of-experts.

SSD, thanks to its reformulation to use matrix multiplication as a subroutine, can exploit specialized matrix multiplication (matmul) units on GPUs, also known as tensor cores. As a result, it is 2-8\u00d7 faster than Mamba's fused associative scan, which does not leverage matmul units. Due to its linear scaling in sequence length, SSD is faster than FlashAttention-2 starting at sequence length $2 K$. However, we note that the Mamba-2 model as a whole might not be as efficient to train as Transformer at short sequence length (e.g. at $2 K$ ), since a Transformer with $L$ layers would have $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ attention layers, while a Mamba- 2 model would have $L$ SSD layers for the same number of parameters. Generally the MLP layers are very hardware efficient since they consist of simple matrix multiplication and pointwise linearity. As shown in Section 9.2.3, one can also combine $\\frac{L}{2}$ SSD layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers to speed up training at short sequence length. [^4]Table 4: (Ablations: Mamba-2 block.) We ablate the major differences between the Mamba-2 and Mamba-1 neural network blocks (Figure 6, Section 7.1). Note that these components are independent of the inner sequence mixing layer; in these ablations, we use SSD for the inner SSM layer (differing from the S6 layer of Mamba-1). | Block | ABCX Projections | Extra Normalization | Parameters | Perplexity |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Mamba-1 | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 129.3 M | 11.76 |\n|  | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 129.3 M | 11.54 |\n|  | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 126.5 M | 11.66 |\n| Mamba-2 | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 126.5 M | 11.49 |\n\n### 9.4 Architecture Ablations\n\n### 9.4.1 Block Design\n\nSection 7.1 introduces the Mamba-2 block, which has small modifications to the Mamba-1 block which are partly motivated by the connection to attention and also to improve the scalability of Mamba-2. Table 4 ablates these architecture changes to the block, which occur outside of the core SSM layer. The ablations validate that parallel projections to create $(A, B, C, X)$ saves parameters and performs slightly better than Mamba's sequential projections. More importantly, this modification is amenable to tensor parallelism at larger model sizes (Section 8). Additionally, the extra normalization layer also slightly improves performance. More importantly, preliminary experiments at larger scales observed that it also helps with training stability. ### 9.4.2 Head Structure\n\nSection 7.2 describes how the dimensions of the $B, C, X$ projections can be viewed as a hyperparameter analogous to notions of multi-head attention and multi-query attention. We also showed how the original Mamba architecture is analogous to multi-value attention (Proposition 7.2), which was a choice that naturally developed from the state-space model point of view and was not previously ablated. Table 5 ablates choices of the multi-head structure for the Mamba-2 architecture. Strikingly, we find a large difference between multi-value and multi-query or multi-key head patterns, despite seeming very similar. Note that this is not explained by the total state size, which is the same for all of them (equal to HPN or the product of the number of heads, head dimension, and state dimension). We also compare to multi-head patterns where the number of $C, B, X$ (analogous to $Q, K, V$ ) heads is equal. We compare against the standard multi-head pattern, as well as one with aggressive sharing where they all have only 1 head. Note that in the latter case, the model still has H different sequence mixers $M$, because each head still has a different $A$. When parameter matched, these multi-head patterns perform similarly to each other, in between the MVA and MQA/MKA patterns. ### 9.4.3 Attention Kernel Approximations\n\nSection 7.3 noted how SSD can be combined with ideas from the linear attention literature, such as various forms of kernel approximations. We ablate several variants of these suggested by previous works in Table 6. These include the cosFormer (Qin, Weixuan Sun, et al. 2022), Random Feature Attention H. Peng et al. 2021, and Positive Random Features (Performer) (Choromanski et al. 2021). We also ablate adding a normalization term, akin to the denominator of the softmax function in standard attention. We found that this introduced instabilities to most variants, but slightly improved performance for the ReLU activation function $\\psi$. Table 7 also tests more recent proposals to improve linear attention that involve expanding the feature dimension (Based (Arora, Eyuboglu, Zhang, et al. 2024) and ReBased (Aksenov et al. 2024)). These linear attention extensions aim to appropriate the $\\exp$ kernel with a quadratic approximation. ReBased also proposes to replace the QK activation function with a layer normalization; from an SSM-centric view we apply a normalization on top of $(B, C)$ before applying the SSM function. Table 5: (Ablations: Multi-head structure.) All models have state expansion factor $N=64$ and head size $P=64$ and are trained to Chinchilla scaling law token counts. The number of $A$ heads is always equal to the total heads H , i.e. each head has a separate input-dependent $A$ decay factor.

Thus our default settings for Mamba-2 used $\\psi(x)=$ Swish $(x)$ to follow Mamba-1, but we suggest that removing this activation entirely may be a simpler choice that we did not extensively test. We emphasize however that SSD and vanilla linear attention differ in the inclusion of the 1-semiseparable mask $L$, while the various linear attention methods in the literature were derived to approximate softmax attention without this term; thus, our negative results may be not unexpected. ## 10 Related Work and Discussion\n\nThe state space duality framework bridges connections between SSMs, structured matrices, and attention. We discuss in more depth the relations between SSD and these concepts more broadly. Using ideas from each of the viewpoints, we also suggest some directions that the SSD framework can be extended in future work. ### 10.1 State Space Models\n\nStructured state space models can be characterized along the axes\n(i) whether it is time-invariant or time-varying.\n```\n\n#### 3.

ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 5.

The key objectives include:\n\n- **Efficient Long Sequence Modeling**: Improve the model's ability to handle long sequences without significant increases in computational complexity.\n- **Global and Local Dependencies**: Capture both global and local dependencies within the sequences.\n- **Localized Modifications**: Ensure that any modifications are confined within the **FastTTTLinear** GAU to adhere to project constraints.\n- **Computational Efficiency and Training Stability**: Maintain or improve computational efficiency and ensure training stability.\n\n### Most Useful Information\n\n#### Integration of SSMs and Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **SPADE Model**: This model augments a state space model into the bottom layer of a transformer, capturing global information efficiently and complementing local attention mechanisms. This approach is relevant as it shows how SSMs can be integrated to enhance long-range dependency modeling without increasing complexity significantly.\n\n#### State Space Duality (SSD) Framework\n\n- The SSD framework, proposed by Dao and Gu, highlights the close relationship between transformers and SSMs. This framework can guide the integration of SSMs into **FastTTTLinear**, ensuring mathematically sound and efficient modifications. It suggests that combining SSM layers with attention layers can yield better performance than using either alone.\n\n#### Hierarchical Approaches and Short-Long Convolutions\n\n- Models like **CHELA** use hierarchical structures and combine short-long convolutions to capture both local and global dependencies. This approach can be adapted to enable **FastTTTLinear** to process sequences at multiple scales, improving efficiency in modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n#### Efficient State Space Models (eSSM)\n\n- The eSSM architecture, which utilizes convolutional representation of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) SSMs, can be highly efficient for long sequence modeling. It employs techniques like diagonalization and fast tensor convolution via FFT, reducing parameter size and improving computational efficiency. This could be a valuable reference for optimizing the integration of SSMs into **FastTTTLinear**.\n\n#### Balancing SSM Layers and Attention Layers\n\n- Research indicates that having a mix of SSM layers and attention layers performs better than using only one type of layer. For instance, incorporating around 10% of attention layers in an otherwise SSM-based model improved performance. This balance can be crucial in modifying **FastTTTLinear** to include both SSM and attention components.\n\n### Key Insights for Implementation\n\n- **Localized Integration**: Integrate an SSM layer or a hierarchical approach that combines SSMs and attention within the **FastTTTLinear** GAU, ensuring localized changes.\n- **SSD Framework**: Use the SSD framework to guide the integration, ensuring mathematical soundness and efficiency.\n- **Balanced Layers**: Implement a mix of SSM layers and attention layers to capture both global and local dependencies effectively.\n- **Efficient Techniques**: Employ efficient techniques such as diagonalization, fast tensor convolution, and short-long convolutions to maintain or improve computational efficiency.\n- **Training Stability**: Ensure that the integration does not introduce instability during training by carefully designing and testing the modifications.\n\nBy focusing on these insights and approaches, the researcher can develop a novel autoregressive LM block that efficiently models long sequences, captures both global and local dependencies, and maintains computational efficiency and training stability.\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

Introduction\n\nSince the release of ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023), large language models have entered a new epoch, showcasing outstanding abilities in language comprehension, dialogue, and logical reasoning. Over the past year, the industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous large language models, such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) and ChatGLM (Zeng et al., 2023). These large language models have given rise to a plethora of practical applications, including conversational bots, code assistants, and AI agents. The foundation of large language models lies in the Transformer network\n\n[^0]structure (Vaswani et al., 2017), primarily utilizing a multihead self-attention module for modeling relationships between tokens and a Feed-forward network for non-linear feature transformations. The scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020) based on the Transformer structure has propelled the continuous development and expansion of large language models. In the Transformer network, multi-head self-attention (MHSA) plays a crucial role, but it comes with significant computational demands and memory requirements during inference. In terms of computational complexity, for an input sentence of length $N$, the calculation of selfattention has a complexity of $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ during training and inference. Regarding memory usage, previously encountered keys and values are stored, leading to a memory occupation of $O(N D)$. As a result, recent efforts on network architectures have focused on simplifying Transformer by reducing its computation and space complexity. This includes various approaches, notably convolutional language models (Poli et al., 2023), recurrent unit (Lei, 2021), long context models (Ding et al., 2023), and state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; Gu \\& Dao, 2023). These new models have provided strong alternatives to Transformer for building efficient LLMs. SSMs propose modeling sequences by introducing an appropriate design of hidden states for handling long-range dependencies with both training parallelizability and inference efficiency. Starting from the continuous mapping system, SSMs are discretized to process discrete inputs in deep learning such as language sequence. The discretized SSMs can be computed in both linear recurrence and global convolution modes. Commonly, convolution mode is used during training to achieve parallel acceleration, while recurrence mode is used during autoregressive inference because it has lower computational complexity. The core distinction of SSMs from other neural networks, such as fully-connected neural networks, lies in the design of hidden states. Hidden states enable information to be propagated along the temporal dimension, while avoiding the computation complexity of accessing historical tokens at each step. Through state transition parameters $A$, hidden states transfer the hidden information from the previous time\nsteps to the current time step, allowing for autoregressive prediction of the next token. Hidden states play a crucial role in SSMs, but have not received sufficient investigation in the past. Weights and hidden features in different layers contain information at various levels from fine-grained to coarsegrained (Gu et al., 2021). However, in previous versions of SSMs, hidden states only flowed within the current layer and could not transmit more information to deeper layers, thus failing to capture more hierarchical information. In this paper, we propose DenseSSM to facilitate a more comprehensive flow of hidden information between layers in state space models. We first analyze the hidden state degradation in conventional SSMs which will prevent hidden information flow from low levels to high levels. By selectively integrating shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information that is useful for the final output. The proposed method is applicable to different types of SSMs, such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) and Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023). Our approach maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency of SSMs, while achieving a significant improvement with only a slight increase in the number of parameters. For instance, our DenseRetNet model outperforms traditional RetNet with up to 5\\% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 2 raw search queries input to the search frame: State Space Models Gated Linear Attention Integration Autoregressive Language Modeling, State Space Duality Transformers Integration Hybrid Sequence Modeling Efficiency\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 143  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n#### 3.

At their core is an attention function which models pairwise interactions between the inputs at every timestep. While attention is powerful, it does not scale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic time and space complexity in the sequence length. We propose RFA, a linear time and space attention that uses random feature methods to approximate the softmax function, and explore its application in transformers. RFA can be used as a drop-in replacement for conventional softmax attention and offers a straightforward way of learning with recency bias through an optional gating mechanism. Experiments on language modeling and machine translation demonstrate that RFA achieves similar or better performance compared to strong transformer baselines. In the machine translation experiment, RFA decodes twice as fast as a vanilla transformer. Compared to existing efficient transformer variants, RFA is competitive in terms of both accuracy and efficiency on three long text classification datasets. Our analysis shows that RFA's efficiency gains are especially notable on long sequences, suggesting that RFA will be particularly useful in tasks that require working with large inputs, fast decoding speed, or low memory footprints.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 313  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n#### 4.

Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 270  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 5.

Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n#### 2.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 4. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 5.

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformers, in particular decoder-only models (e.g. GPT (Brown et al. 2020), Llama (Touvron, Lavril, et al. 2023)) which process input sequences in a causal fashion, are one of the main drivers of modern deep learning's success. Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

At their core is an attention function which models pairwise interactions between the inputs at every timestep. While attention is powerful, it does not scale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic time and space complexity in the sequence length. We propose RFA, a linear time and space attention that uses random feature methods to approximate the softmax function, and explore its application in transformers. RFA can be used as a drop-in replacement for conventional softmax attention and offers a straightforward way of learning with recency bias through an optional gating mechanism. Experiments on language modeling and machine translation demonstrate that RFA achieves similar or better performance compared to strong transformer baselines. In the machine translation experiment, RFA decodes twice as fast as a vanilla transformer. Compared to existing efficient transformer variants, RFA is competitive in terms of both accuracy and efficiency on three long text classification datasets. Our analysis shows that RFA's efficiency gains are especially notable on long sequences, suggesting that RFA will be particularly useful in tasks that require working with large inputs, fast decoding speed, or low memory footprints.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 313  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n#### 3.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n#### 2.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg.

Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformers, in particular decoder-only models (e.g. GPT (Brown et al. 2020), Llama (Touvron, Lavril, et al. 2023)) which process input sequences in a causal fashion, are one of the main drivers of modern deep learning's success. Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: Structured State Space Models Gated Linear Attention Autoregressive Language Modeling\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length.

What Makes Convolutional Models Great on Long Sequence Modeling?\n\n*From Search Query: Structured State Space Models Gated Linear Attention Autoregressive Language Modeling*\n\n*Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, De-huai Chen, Debadeepta Dey*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple yet effective convolutional model called Structured Global Convolution (SGConv), which exhibits strong empirical performance over several tasks and shows the potential to improve both efficiency and performance when plugging SGConv into standard language and vision models.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional models have been widely used in multiple domains. However, most existing models only use local convolution, making the model unable to handle long-range dependency efficiently. Attention overcomes this problem by aggregating global information but also makes the computational complexity quadratic to the sequence length. Recently, Gu et al. [2021] proposed a model called S4 inspired by the state space model. S4 can be efficiently implemented as a global convolutional model whose kernel size equals the input sequence length. S4 can model much longer sequences than Transformers and achieve significant gains over SoTA on several long-range tasks. Despite its empirical success, S4 is involved. It requires sophisticated parameterization and initialization schemes. As a result, S4 is less intuitive and hard to use. Here we aim to demystify S4 and extract basic principles that contribute to the success of S4 as a global convolutional model. We focus on the structure of the convolution kernel and identify two critical but intuitive principles enjoyed by S4 that are sufficient to make up an effective global convolutional model: 1) The parameterization of the convolutional kernel needs to be efficient in the sense that the number of parameters should scale sub-linearly with sequence length. 2) The kernel needs to satisfy a decaying structure that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. Based on the two principles, we propose a simple yet effective convolutional model called Structured Global Convolution (SGConv). SGConv exhibits strong empirical performance over several tasks: 1) With faster speed, SGConv surpasses S4 on Long Range Arena and Speech Command datasets. 2) When plugging SGConv into standard language and vision models, it shows the potential to improve both efficiency and performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 82  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 4. Random Feature Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Structured State Space Models Gated Linear Attention Autoregressive Language Modeling*\n\n*Hao Peng, Nikolaos Pappas, Dani Yogatama, Roy Schwartz, Noah A. Smith, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** RFA, a linear time and space attention that uses random feature methods to approximate the softmax function, is proposed and explored, suggesting that RFA will be particularly useful in tasks that require working with large inputs, fast decoding speed, or low memory footprints.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are state-of-the-art models for a variety of sequence modeling tasks. At their core is an attention function which models pairwise interactions between the inputs at every timestep. While attention is powerful, it does not scale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic time and space complexity in the sequence length. We propose RFA, a linear time and space attention that uses random feature methods to approximate the softmax function, and explore its application in transformers. RFA can be used as a drop-in replacement for conventional softmax attention and offers a straightforward way of learning with recency bias through an optional gating mechanism. Experiments on language modeling and machine translation demonstrate that RFA achieves similar or better performance compared to strong transformer baselines. In the machine translation experiment, RFA decodes twice as fast as a vanilla transformer. Compared to existing efficient transformer variants, RFA is competitive in terms of both accuracy and efficiency on three long text classification datasets. Our analysis shows that RFA's efficiency gains are especially notable on long sequences, suggesting that RFA will be particularly useful in tasks that require working with large inputs, fast decoding speed, or low memory footprints.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 313  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n#### 5. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Structured State Space Models Gated Linear Attention Autoregressive Language Modeling*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block, such as the **SSMFastTTTLinear**, that integrates **State Space Models (SSMs)** with **Gated Linear Attention (GLA)** within **Generalized Autoregressive Units (GAUs)**, here are some key areas and specific information that would be most useful:\n\n### Integration Mechanism\n\n1. **Hybrid Architectures**:\n   - Study the architectures of models like **Mamba** and **DenseMamba**, which have successfully integrated SSMs with attention mechanisms.

Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

Introduction\n\nSince the release of ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023), large language models have entered a new epoch, showcasing outstanding abilities in language comprehension, dialogue, and logical reasoning. Over the past year, the industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous large language models, such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) and ChatGLM (Zeng et al., 2023). These large language models have given rise to a plethora of practical applications, including conversational bots, code assistants, and AI agents. The foundation of large language models lies in the Transformer network\n\n[^0]structure (Vaswani et al., 2017), primarily utilizing a multihead self-attention module for modeling relationships between tokens and a Feed-forward network for non-linear feature transformations. The scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020) based on the Transformer structure has propelled the continuous development and expansion of large language models. In the Transformer network, multi-head self-attention (MHSA) plays a crucial role, but it comes with significant computational demands and memory requirements during inference. In terms of computational complexity, for an input sentence of length $N$, the calculation of selfattention has a complexity of $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ during training and inference. Regarding memory usage, previously encountered keys and values are stored, leading to a memory occupation of $O(N D)$. As a result, recent efforts on network architectures have focused on simplifying Transformer by reducing its computation and space complexity. This includes various approaches, notably convolutional language models (Poli et al., 2023), recurrent unit (Lei, 2021), long context models (Ding et al., 2023), and state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; Gu \\& Dao, 2023). These new models have provided strong alternatives to Transformer for building efficient LLMs. SSMs propose modeling sequences by introducing an appropriate design of hidden states for handling long-range dependencies with both training parallelizability and inference efficiency. Starting from the continuous mapping system, SSMs are discretized to process discrete inputs in deep learning such as language sequence. The discretized SSMs can be computed in both linear recurrence and global convolution modes. Commonly, convolution mode is used during training to achieve parallel acceleration, while recurrence mode is used during autoregressive inference because it has lower computational complexity. The core distinction of SSMs from other neural networks, such as fully-connected neural networks, lies in the design of hidden states. Hidden states enable information to be propagated along the temporal dimension, while avoiding the computation complexity of accessing historical tokens at each step. Through state transition parameters $A$, hidden states transfer the hidden information from the previous time\nsteps to the current time step, allowing for autoregressive prediction of the next token. Hidden states play a crucial role in SSMs, but have not received sufficient investigation in the past. Weights and hidden features in different layers contain information at various levels from fine-grained to coarsegrained (Gu et al., 2021). However, in previous versions of SSMs, hidden states only flowed within the current layer and could not transmit more information to deeper layers, thus failing to capture more hierarchical information. In this paper, we propose DenseSSM to facilitate a more comprehensive flow of hidden information between layers in state space models. We first analyze the hidden state degradation in conventional SSMs which will prevent hidden information flow from low levels to high levels. By selectively integrating shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information that is useful for the final output. The proposed method is applicable to different types of SSMs, such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) and Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023). Our approach maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency of SSMs, while achieving a significant improvement with only a slight increase in the number of parameters. For instance, our DenseRetNet model outperforms traditional RetNet with up to 5\\% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 7 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 2 raw search queries input to the search frame: State Space Models Gated Linear Attention Integration Autoregressive Language Modeling, State Space Duality Transformers Integration\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 6 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

At their core is an attention function which models pairwise interactions between the inputs at every timestep. While attention is powerful, it does not scale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic time and space complexity in the sequence length. We propose RFA, a linear time and space attention that uses random feature methods to approximate the softmax function, and explore its application in transformers. RFA can be used as a drop-in replacement for conventional softmax attention and offers a straightforward way of learning with recency bias through an optional gating mechanism. Experiments on language modeling and machine translation demonstrate that RFA achieves similar or better performance compared to strong transformer baselines. In the machine translation experiment, RFA decodes twice as fast as a vanilla transformer. Compared to existing efficient transformer variants, RFA is competitive in terms of both accuracy and efficiency on three long text classification datasets. Our analysis shows that RFA's efficiency gains are especially notable on long sequences, suggesting that RFA will be particularly useful in tasks that require working with large inputs, fast decoding speed, or low memory footprints.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 313  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n#### 4.

VSSD: Vision Mamba with Non-Causal State Space Duality\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Duality Transformers Integration*\n\n*Chang Xu, Mingjia Li, Minjing Dong, Yuheng Shi*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers have significantly advanced the field of computer vision, offering robust modeling capabilities and global receptive field. However, their high computational demands limit their applicability in processing long sequences. To tackle this issue, State Space Models (SSMs) have gained prominence in vision tasks as they offer linear computational complexity. Recently, State Space Duality (SSD), an improved variant of SSMs, was introduced in Mamba2 to enhance model performance and efficiency. However, the inherent causal nature of SSD/SSMs restricts their applications in non-causal vision tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Visual State Space Duality (VSSD) model, which has a non-causal format of SSD. Specifically, we propose to discard the magnitude of interactions between the hidden state and tokens while preserving their relative weights, which relieves the dependencies of token contribution on previous tokens. Together with the involvement of multi-scan strategies, we show that the scanning results can be integrated to achieve non-causality, which not only improves the performance of SSD in vision tasks but also enhances its efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on various benchmarks including image classification, detection, and segmentation, where VSSD surpasses existing state-of-the-art SSM-based models.

This integration also enhances the model's ability to capture both local and global dependencies, potentially reducing perplexity and improving accuracy on downstream tasks.\n- **Benchmarking**: It is crucial to benchmark the proposed model against existing state-of-the-art models on standardized datasets like the Long Range Arena (LRA) to gauge its performance metrics accurately.\n\n#### Novelty and Differentiation\n- **Unique Integration**: The specific integration of SSMs with GLA within the GAU framework is novel and offers a unique approach.

The researcher should also consider the stateful nature of SSMs and how to manage memory efficiently, possibly by leveraging structured connections and selective activation as in **Mamba**.\n- **Computational Overhead**: Optimizing computational steps through hardware-aware algorithms, similar to those used in **Lightning Attention**, can help maintain overall efficiency.\n\n### Useful References and Further Reading\n\n1. **Long Range Language Modeling via Gated State Spaces**:\n   - This paper introduces Gated State Spaces, which can be a key component in designing the hybrid architecture for **SSMFastTTTLinear**.\n\n2. **Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces**:\n   - This work provides insights into how selective SSMs can be integrated into a sequence modeling architecture, achieving fast inference and linear scaling in sequence length.\n\n3. **Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality**:\n   - This paper offers a theoretical framework that can be used to design and optimize the integration of SSMs with GLA within the GAU framework.\n\n4. **DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models**:\n   - This study shows how dense connections can enhance the efficiency and performance of SSMs, which could be beneficial for the proposed model.\n\n5. **Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling**:\n   - This work introduces the concept of Sparse Modular Activation, which can be used to sparsely activate GAUs based on state representations learned from SSMs, achieving linear inference complexity.\n\n### Search Queries and Next Steps\n\n#### External Source Searches\n\n```keywords\nState Space Models Gated Linear Attention Integration Autoregressive Language Modeling\nState Space Duality Transformers Integration\nEfficient Sequence Modeling Long Range Dependencies\n```\n\n#### Internal Library Search\n\n```description\nResearch papers and technical documents that explore the integration of State Space Models (SSMs) with Gated Linear Attention (GLA) within Generalized Autoregressive Units (GAUs) or similar architectures in language modeling.

The FastTTTLinear GAU improves upon TTTLinear by integrating Gated Linear Attention (GLA), but it still faces limitations in capturing global dependencies over extended contexts. State Space Models (SSMs) offer an alternative approach to sequence modeling with linear computational complexity and the ability to model long-range dependencies effectively. By integrating SSMs into the FastTTTLinear GAU, we aim to enhance its capacity to model long sequences efficiently, capturing both local and global dependencies without significant increases in computational overhead.\n\n## Related Work\n\n**State Space Models (SSMs):** SSMs, such as those proposed in the Structured State Space for Sequence Modeling (S4) [Gu et al., 2021], efficiently model long sequences by encoding the entire sequence history into a hidden state updated recursively. SSMs have demonstrated strong performance on tasks requiring long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity.\n\n**SPADE:** SPADE [Zuo et al., 2022] integrates an SSM into the bottom layer of a Transformer, capturing global information efficiently and complementing local attention mechanisms. This hybrid approach shows that combining SSMs with attention mechanisms can effectively handle long sequences.\n\n**Mamba and Mamba-2:** Mamba [Gu & Dao, 2023] and Mamba-2 [Dao & Gu, 2024] highlight the close relationship between SSMs and Transformers, proposing a hybrid architecture combining SSM layers and attention layers, leading to improved performance.\n\n**Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms:** Hierarchical models process sequences at multiple scales, efficiently capturing both local and global dependencies [Yang et al., 2016].\n\nThese works indicate that integrating SSMs with attention mechanisms can enhance long-sequence modeling, providing both efficiency and expressiveness.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n**Challenges with FastTTTLinear:**\n\n- **Limited Long-Range Dependency Modeling:** While FastTTTLinear improves efficiency with Gated Linear Attention, it may struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively due to limitations inherent in attention mechanisms over extended contexts.\n\n- **Computational Overhead:** As sequence length increases, even linear attention mechanisms can face computational and memory challenges.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n\nIntegrate a State Space Model into the FastTTTLinear GAU to enhance its ability to model long-range dependencies efficiently. The SSM component will capture global information, while the existing attention mechanism will focus on local dependencies. This hybrid approach aims to improve overall performance on long sequences without significantly increasing computational complexity.\n\n**Theoretical Justification:**\n\n- **Linear Computational Complexity:** SSMs operate with linear time and space complexity concerning sequence length, making them suitable for long sequences.\n\n- **Effective Global Context Modeling:** SSMs can efficiently capture global dependencies, complementing the local focus of attention mechanisms.\n\n- **Hybrid Synergy:** Combining SSMs with attention mechanisms leverages the strengths of both approaches, as demonstrated in prior works like SPADE and Mamba-2.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection FastTTTLinear```\n\n### Modification Overview\n\nModify the **FastTTTLinear** GAU by integrating a State Space Model (SSM) component into its structure.

Compute the attention output \\( Y_{\\text{Attn}} \\) as in FastTTTLinear.\n\n3. **Output Fusion:**\n\n   - Combine outputs with gating:\n\n     \\[\n     Y = \\sigma(G(X)) \\odot Y_{\\text{Attn}} + (1 - \\sigma(G(X))) \\odot Y_{\\text{SSM}}\n     \\]\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Pseudo-code for Modified FastTTTLinear GAU\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom model_discovery.model.utils.modules import GAUBase\n\nclass SSMFastTTTLinear(GAUBase):\n    \"\"\"\n    SSMFastTTTLinear: Enhanced FastTTTLinear GAU with integrated State Space Model (SSM) for efficient long-sequence modeling.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim: int, block_loc: tuple, kwarg_all: dict,\n                 device=None, dtype=None, num_attention_heads=4, ssm_hidden_dim=None, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all)\n        self.factory_kwargs = {'device': device, 'dtype': dtype}\n\n        self.num_heads = num_attention_heads\n        self.head_dim = embed_dim // self.num_heads\n\n        # FastTTTLinear components\n        self.W_Q = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, bias=False, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        self.W_K = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, bias=False, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        self.W_V = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, bias=False, **self.factory_kwargs)\n\n        self.gate_Q = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, bias=True, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        self.gate_K = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, bias=True, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        self.output_proj = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, bias=False, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        self.norm = RMSNorm(embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all, **self.factory_kwargs)\n\n        # State Space Model components\n        self.ssm_hidden_dim = ssm_hidden_dim if ssm_hidden_dim is not None else embed_dim\n        self.A = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(self.ssm_hidden_dim, self.ssm_hidden_dim, **self.factory_kwargs))\n        self.B = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(self.ssm_hidden_dim, embed_dim, **self.factory_kwargs))\n        self.C = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(embed_dim, self.ssm_hidden_dim, **self.factory_kwargs))\n\n        # Gating mechanism for fusion\n        self.gate_fusion = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, bias=True, **self.factory_kwargs)\n\n    def _forward(self, X, **Z):\n        B, L, D = X.size()\n\n        # FastTTTLinear attention computation\n        Q = self.W_Q(X)\n        K = self.W_K(X)\n        V = self.W_V(X)\n\n        G_Q = torch.sigmoid(self.gate_Q(X))\n        G_K = torch.sigmoid(self.gate_K(X))\n\n        Q = Q * G_Q\n        K = K * G_K\n\n        # Reshape for multi-head attention\n        Q = Q.view(B, L, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1,2)\n        K = K.view(B, L, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1,2)\n        V = V.view(B, L, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1,2)\n\n        # Linear attention\n        Q_prime = F.elu(Q) + 1\n        K_prime = F.elu(K) + 1\n        QV = Q_prime * V\n\n        K_cumsum = K_prime.cumsum(dim=2)\n        QV_cumsum = (K_prime * V).cumsum(dim=2)\n\n        epsilon = 1e-6\n        denominator = torch.einsum('bhlf,bhlf->bhl', Q_prime, K_cumsum).unsqueeze(-1) + epsilon\n        attention_output = torch.einsum('bhlf,bhlf->bhlf', Q_prime, QV_cumsum) / denominator\n\n        attention_output = attention_output.transpose(1,2).contiguous().view(B, L, D)\n        attention_output = self.output_proj(attention_output)\n\n        # State Space Model computation\n        # Initialize hidden state h_0\n        h = torch.zeros(B, self.ssm_hidden_dim, device=X.device, dtype=X.dtype)\n        H = []\n        for t in range(L):\n            x_t = X[:, t, :]\n            h = torch.matmul(h, self.A.T) + torch.matmul(x_t, self.B.T)\n            H.append(h.unsqueeze(1))\n        H = torch.cat(H, dim=1)  # Shape: (B, L, ssm_hidden_dim)\n        ssm_output = torch.matmul(H, self.C.T)  # Shape: (B, L, D)\n\n        # Fusion of attention and SSM outputs\n        G_fusion = torch.sigmoid(self.gate_fusion(X))\n        output = G_fusion * attention_output + (1 -

Define parameters \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) for the SSM within the GAU.\n   - Initialize the hidden state \\( h_0 \\) as zeros.\n\n2. **Implement SSM Computation:**\n\n   - Iterate over the sequence length \\( L \\) to compute the hidden states \\( h_t \\).\n   - Compute the SSM output \\( Y_{\\text{SSM}} \\) from the hidden states.\n\n3. **Modify Gating Mechanisms:**\n\n   - Introduce a gating function \\( G_{\\text{fusion}} \\) to balance the attention and SSM outputs.\n   - Use a learnable linear layer followed by a sigmoid activation for \\( G_{\\text{fusion}} \\).\n\n4. **Fuse Outputs:**\n\n   - Combine the attention output \\( Y_{\\text{Attn}} \\) and the SSM output \\( Y_{\\text{SSM}} \\) using the gating function.\n\n5. **Ensure Computational Efficiency:**\n\n   - Optimize the SSM computation by vectorizing operations if possible.\n   - Consider using efficient implementations of SSMs, such as those in S4, which avoid explicit recursion.\n\n6. **Integrate into Existing Model:**\n\n   - Replace the original FastTTTLinear GAU with the modified SSMFastTTTLinear in the model.\n   - Ensure input and output dimensions remain consistent.\n\n7. **Training Considerations:**\n\n   - Adjust training hyperparameters if necessary to accommodate the new components.\n   - Monitor training for stability; consider adding normalization within the SSM if needed.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed **SSMFastTTTLinear** enhances the FastTTTLinear GAU by integrating a State Space Model component to capture global dependencies efficiently. This integration allows the model to handle long sequences more effectively by combining the strengths of SSMs for modeling long-range dependencies and the attention mechanism for capturing local interactions. By maintaining computational efficiency and making localized modifications to the GAU, this design aligns with the project's goals and guidelines. We expect improvements in perplexity on corpora, accuracy on downstream tasks, robustness to varied inputs, and scalability with longer sequences and larger models.\n\n## References\n\n1. **Gu, A., Goel, K., & R\u00e9, C.
