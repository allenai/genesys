To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 32/48 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\nSmola, and Eduard H.

Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/94 (Score: 0.76)*\n\n```\nIEEE, 2015. [3] J. Abreu, L. Fred, D. Mac\u00eado, and C. Zanchettin.

The expressive power of pooling in Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: geometric hierarchical neural networks attention*\n\n*F. Bianchi, Veronica Lachi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work derives sufficient conditions for a pooling operator to fully preserve the expressive power of the MP layers before it, which serve as a universal and theoretically grounded criterion for choosing among existing pooling operators or designing new ones.\n\n**Abstract:** In Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), hierarchical pooling operators generate local summaries of the data by coarsening the graph structure and the vertex features. While considerable attention has been devoted to analyzing the expressive power of message-passing (MP) layers in GNNs, a study on how graph pooling affects the expressiveness of a GNN is still lacking. Additionally, despite the recent advances in the design of pooling operators, there is not a principled criterion to compare them. In this work, we derive sufficient conditions for a pooling operator to fully preserve the expressive power of the MP layers before it. These conditions serve as a universal and theoretically grounded criterion for choosing among existing pooling operators or designing new ones. Based on our theoretical findings, we analyze several existing pooling operators and identify those that fail to satisfy the expressiveness conditions. Finally, we introduce an experimental setup to verify empirically the expressive power of a GNN equipped with pooling layers, in terms of its capability to perform a graph isomorphism test.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 3.

FasterViT combines the benefits of fast local representation learning in CNNs and global modeling properties in ViT. Our newly introduced Hierarchical Attention (HAT) approach decomposes global self-attention with quadratic complexity into a multi-level attention with reduced computational costs. We benefit from efficient window-based self-attention. Each window has access to dedicated carrier tokens that participate in local and global representation learning. At a high level, global self-attentions enable the efficient cross-window communication at lower costs. FasterViT achieves a SOTA Pareto-front in terms of accuracy and image throughput. We have extensively validated its effectiveness on various CV tasks including classification, object detection and segmentation. We also show that HAT can be used as a plug-and-play module for existing networks and enhance them.

Riemannian Residual Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: geometric hierarchical neural networks attention*\n\n*Isay Katsman, Eric Chen, Sidhanth Holalkere, Anna Asch, Aaron Lou, Ser-Nam Lim, Christopher De Sa*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that the Riemannian ResNets mirror these desirable properties: when compared to existing manifold neural networks designed to learn over hyperbolic space and the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices, they outperform both kinds of networks in terms of relevant testing metrics and training dynamics.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent methods in geometric deep learning have introduced various neural networks to operate over data that lie on Riemannian manifolds. Such networks are often necessary to learn well over graphs with a hierarchical structure or to learn over manifold-valued data encountered in the natural sciences. These networks are often inspired by and directly generalize standard Euclidean neural networks. However, extending Euclidean networks is difficult and has only been done for a select few manifolds. In this work, we examine the residual neural network (ResNet) and show how to extend this construction to general Riemannian manifolds in a geometrically principled manner. Originally introduced to help solve the vanishing gradient problem, ResNets have become ubiquitous in machine learning due to their beneficial learning properties, excellent empirical results, and easy-to-incorporate nature when building varied neural networks. We find that our Riemannian ResNets mirror these desirable properties: when compared to existing manifold neural networks designed to learn over hyperbolic space and the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices, we outperform both kinds of networks in terms of relevant testing metrics and training dynamics.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Trajectory Prediction with Graph-based Dual-scale Context Fusion\n\n*From Search Query: geometric hierarchical neural networks attention*\n\n*Shaojie Shen, Jing Chen, Peiliang Li, Lu Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Motion prediction for traffic participants is essential for a safe and robust automated driving system, especially in cluttered urban environments. However, it is highly challenging due to the complex road topology as well as the uncertain intentions of the other agents. In this paper, we present a graph-based trajectory prediction network named the Dual Scale Predictor (DSP), which encodes both the static and dynamical driving context in a hierarchical manner. Different from methods based on a rasterized map or sparse lane graph, we consider the driving context as a graph with two layers, focusing on both geometrical and topological features. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are applied to extract features with different levels of granularity, and features are subsequently aggregated with attention-based inter-layer networks, realizing better local-global feature fusion. Following the recent goal-driven trajectory prediction pipeline, goal candidates with high likelihood for the target agent are extracted, and predicted trajectories are generated conditioned on these goals. Thanks to the proposed dual-scale context fusion network, our DSP is able to generate accurate and human-like multi-modal trajectories. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale Argoverse motion forecasting benchmark, and it achieves promising results, outperforming the recent state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Published:** 2021-11-02\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model by integrating geometric and hierarchical processing with attention mechanisms, here are some key findings and references that align with your research focus:\n\n## Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (h-GNNs)\nThe paper on \"Hierarchical Graph Neural Network: A Lightweight Image Matching\" provides insights into hierarchical processing and attention mechanisms, although it is applied in the context of image matching. This work describes a hierarchical GNN (h-GNN) that successively stacks multiple compressed-size graphs, increasing the network\u2019s depth. It uses attention mechanisms to initiate node representations at each hierarchical level and employs message-passing mechanisms to update and aggregate information within and across levels. This hierarchical and attention-based approach could be adapted to language models to handle multi-scale feature representations and efficient information routing.\n\n## Geometric and Hierarchical Processing\nThe study on \"Pushing the Limits of All-Atom Geometric Graph Neural Networks\" discusses the use of geometric graph neural networks, which could be relevant when considering geometric priors in hierarchical models. While this work is focused on protein representations, the principles of incorporating geometric information into neural networks can be generalized. The use of attention mechanisms in these networks to extract multi-level feature representations is particularly noteworthy.\n\n## Attention Mechanisms and Contrastive Learning\nThe paper on \"Graph attention automatic encoder based on contrastive learning\" highlights the use of graph attention networks (GATs) and contrastive learning mechanisms to learn hierarchical structures. This work employs multiple contrastive learning mechanisms to enhance the representation of nodes at different hierarchy levels, which could be a valuable approach for improving feature representation in language models. The integration of global, context, and local location-based contrastive learning can help in capturing complex relationships and hierarchical structures, similar to what might be needed in autoregressive language models.\n\n## Unified Adaptive Mechanisms and Memory Efficiency\nTo combine the strengths of both parent models (hiergpt and geogate_gpt), you can look into integrating adaptive mechanisms such as those described in the h-GNN paper. The use of attention mechanisms with adaptive parameter initialization and dynamic head routing from the geogate_gpt model can be unified with the hierarchical normalization techniques from the hiergpt model. This integration can help in reducing redundancy and improving memory efficiency, which is crucial for large-scale language models.\n\n## Key Insights for Autoregressive Language Models\n- **Geometric-Hierarchical Integration**: Incorporating geometric priors into hierarchical normalization layers can enhance feature representation and capture complex relationships.\n- **Unified Adaptive Mechanisms**: Combining adaptive normalization, attention routing, and dynamic head mechanisms can improve efficiency and reduce redundancy.\n- **Memory-Efficient Implementations**: Techniques such as hierarchical grouping and selective computation can be combined to ensure memory efficiency in multi-scale processing.\n- **Information Routing**: Using attention mechanisms and contrastive learning to route information effectively across different hierarchical levels can improve the overall performance of the model.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, you can design an autoregressive language model that leverages both geometric and hierarchical processing, along with advanced attention mechanisms, to achieve better feature representation, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens. On benchmarks including code and mathematics, we find that the model is capable of making use of newly defined functions and theorems during test time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/26 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/12 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/2106.01540, 2021.

Score: 0.99)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Reformer: The Efficient Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Nikita Kitaev, Lukasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2020)\t**Cited by** 1881  (*Influential: 222*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work replaces dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing and uses reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of several times, making the model much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly, especially on long sequences. We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n#### 5. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/44 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2206.11894, 2022 .

The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark.

Parallel and Efficient Hierarchical k-Median Clustering\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient hierarchical attention causal*\n\n*Vincent Cohen-Addad, Silvio Lattanzi, A. Norouzi-Fard, C. Sohler, O. Svensson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a new parallel algorithm for the Euclidean hierarchical k -median problem that outputs a hierarchical clustering such that for every value of k the cost of the solution is at most an O (min { d, log n } log \u2206) factor larger in expectation than that of an optimal solution.\n\n**Abstract:** As a fundamental unsupervised learning task, hierarchical clustering has been extensively studied in the past decade. In particular, standard metric formulations as hierarchical k -center, k -means, and k -median received a lot of attention and the problems have been studied extensively in different models of computation. Despite all this interest, not many ef\ufb01cient parallel algorithms are known for these problems. In this paper we introduce a new parallel algorithm for the Euclidean hierarchical k -median problem that, when using machines with memory s (for s \u2208 \u2126(log 2 ( n + \u2206 + d )) ), outputs a hierarchical clustering such that for every \ufb01xed value of k the cost of the solution is at most an O (min { d, log n } log \u2206) factor larger in expectation than that of an optimal solution. Furthermore, we also get that in for all k simultanuously the cost of the solution is at most an expected O (min { d, log n } log \u2206 log(\u2206 dn )) factor bigger that the corresponding optimal solution. The algorithm requires in O (log s ( nd log( n + \u2206))) rounds. Here d is the dimension of the data set and \u2206 is the ratio between the maximum and minimum distance of two points in the input dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst parallel algorithm for the hierarchical k -median problem with theoretical guarantees. We further complement our theoretical results with an empirical study of our algorithm that shows its effectiveness in practice.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Smith*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and it outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architectures have achieved state- of-the-art results on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their attention mechanism comes with a quadratic complexity in sequence lengths, making the computational overhead prohibitive, especially for long sequences. Attention context can be seen as a random-access memory with each token taking a slot. Under this perspective, the memory size grows linearly with the sequence length, and so does the overhead of reading from it. One way to improve the efficiency is to bound the memory size. We show that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and they vary in their organization of the memory. ABC reveals new, unexplored possibilities. First, it connects several efficient attention variants that would otherwise seem apart. Second, this abstraction gives new insights\u2014an established approach (Wang et al., 2020b) previously thought to not be applicable in causal attention, actually is. Last, we present a new instance of ABC, which draws inspiration from existing ABC approaches, but replaces their heuristic memory-organizing functions with a learned, contextualized one. Our experiments on language modeling, machine translation, and masked language model finetuning show that our approach outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5. Towards mental time travel: a hierarchical memory for reinforcement learning agents\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient hierarchical attention causal*\n\n*Andrew Kyle Lampinen, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Andrea Banino, Felix Hill*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures), and is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning agents often forget details of the past, especially after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore\"mentally time-travel\"-- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 42  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design with a focus on memory-efficient implementations of hierarchical attention mechanisms, maintaining causality, and efficient computation, here are some relevant findings and references:\n\n## Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The concept of hierarchical attention is well-explored in the context of reducing computational costs. For instance, the \"Nova\" model introduces a hierarchical self-attention mechanism designed for assembly code but can be adapted for other sequential data. This mechanism breaks down the semantics into three levels: intra-instruction, preceding-instruction, and inter-instruction attention. This hierarchical approach can capture long dependencies efficiently while maintaining causality.\n\n## Causal Attention and Efficiency\n\n- The work on causal image modeling using the Adventurer series models provides insights into how causal attention can be implemented efficiently. By using a global pooling token and inter-layer sequence flipping, these models achieve linear complexity relative to the sequence length, which is more efficient than standard transformers. This approach can be adapted to autoregressive language models to maintain causality while reducing computational costs.\n\n## Memory Efficiency\n\n- The \"H-Transformer-1D\" model is another example that exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) to achieve linear run time and memory complexity. This model's attention mechanism is designed to be memory-efficient and could be integrated into autoregressive language models to improve their efficiency [Analysis Note - Round 1].\n\n## Combining Hierarchical and Causal Attention\n\n- Combining the hierarchical attention mechanisms with causal modeling principles can lead to efficient and scalable autoregressive language models. For example, the hierarchical attention can be structured in a way that each level of the hierarchy only attends to previous tokens, maintaining causality. This can be achieved by using modified attention masks, similar to those used in the Nova model, to ensure that tokens only attend to previous instructions or tokens.\n\n## Practical Implementation\n\n- The \"FasterViT\" model's Hierarchical Attention (HAT) approach decomposes global self-attention into multi-level attention with reduced computational costs. This approach can be adapted to autoregressive language models by using window-based self-attention and dedicated carrier tokens for local and global representation learning, ensuring both efficiency and causality[Analysis Note - Round 1].\n\nBy integrating these concepts, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only memory-efficient but also maintain causality and efficient computation, making them scalable and performant for various tasks.\n",

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/46 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32, 2019 .

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

As more and more data becomes available for training, these networks are increasingly larger [19]. For instance, recent models both in vision [29] and in natural language processing [20, 36, 28] have more than a billion parameters. The higher-capacity enables better modeling of data like natural text or images, and it also improves generalization [41, 33]. Unfortunately, increasing capacity has led to a dramatic increase of computational complexity, both at training and inference time [20]. There is a growing interest in developing architectures with reasonable computational complexity. Recently, there has been some efforts to develop high capacity architectures that operate on a limited computational budget [40, 18]. This is well illustrated by the \"On-device Visual Intelligence Challenge\" [5], which specifically focuses on the complexity/accuracy trade-off for image classification.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/21 (Score: 0.68)*\n\n```\nThe output is the sparse weighted sum over the memories associated with the selected keys. For a large number of keys $|\\mathcal{K}|$, the key selection procedure becomes too expensive in practice. Our product key method is exact and makes this search process very fast. Figure 11, we define keys as the concatenation of two sub-keys, in the spirit of product quantization [21]. As shown in more details in Figure 2, this structure implicitly defines a very large set of keys, each being associated with a value memory slot. The set of value vectors introduces the bulk of the parameters, as it scales quadratically with the number of sub-keys. Despite the large number of memory slots, finding the exact closest keys to the input is very efficient, typically requiring $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{K}|})$ vector comparisons, where $|\\mathcal{K}|$ is the total number of memory slots. All the memory parameters are trainable, yet only a handful of memory slots are updated for each input at training time. Sparsity of key selection and parameter updates make both training and inference very efficient. Our layer allows us to tackle problems where current architectures underfit given the vast amount of available data, or when they are too slow to work in practice. We thus focus on the language modeling task, integrating our memory within the popular transformer architecture [44]. This choice is motivated by the success of BERT [11] and GPT-2 [36], which demonstrated that increasing the capacity of large models directly translates to large improvements in language modeling, which in turn translates to better performance in both language understanding tasks [11, 46] and text generation [36]. Overall, our paper makes the following contributions:\n\n- We introduce a new layer that provides a large capacity to a neural network for only a slight computational overhead both at train and test time. - Our fast indexing strategy offers exact nearest neighbor search by construction, and avoids the pitfall of relying on an indexing structure that needs to be re-learned during training. - We demonstrate our method within a large state-of-the-art transformer, composed of 24 layers of dimension 1600. Our method with 1 memory and 12 layers outperforms a 24 layer transformer while being twice faster at inference time. We show that adding more memory layers to transformers of various complexities provides systematic and significant improvements on our target task. ## 2 Related work\n\nDifferent approaches have been proposed to increase the capacity of neural networks without increasing too much the computational complexity. For instance, conditional computation models aim at routing inputs into very large neural networks such that only a subset of connections and/or layers are used to process each input. Different methods have been developed like large mixture of experts [40], gating techniques [3, 12, 6] or even reinforcement learning-based approaches [10]. Another line of research is the development of memory augmented neural networks. For instance, memory-based neural layers [47, 42] are an efficient way to represent variable length inputs for complex problems such as question answering [48]. Such memories can also operate in feature space and have various reading and writing mechanisms [23, 17]. Unfortunately, these approaches scale linearly with the size of the memory which is prohibitive for very large memories. Neural cache models [15] suffer from the same scaling issues, which are circumvented by adopting approximate lookup techniques at test time [14]. Discretization techniques have been intensively studied for compressing network weights [8, 38] and/or activations [7, 38] or to accelerate inference. For instance, Gerald et al. [13] propose to map an input to a low-dimensional binary code, each code being associated with one category, thus reducing the complexity of inference by avoiding the use of a final large linear layer. Another model is proposed in [45], where the authors develop a fast locality-sensitive hashing technique to approximate the dot product between large matrices and vectors in neural networks. However, exploiting binary codes or approximate techniques at training time raises several challenges in terms of optimization, because approximate indexes are not accurate in high-dimensional spaces. In our paper, we borrow some ideas from product quantization (PQ) [21]. This is an approximate search technique that maps database vectors into compact codes. However, our goal is different: we do not build an approximate index, but rather we exploit the idea to represent a large set of key vectors by a drastically smaller number of vectors, that we update by regular back-propagation. As discussed later, the selection of the closest keys is exact and inherits from the fast neighbor search of PQ. Our model is also related to sparsity models which have been mainly studied in the unsupervised learning setting [34, 24]. For instance, the k-sparse autoencoder [30] only keeps the k largest values in the latent representation of an auto-encoder, similar to our memory layer but without the product keys component. In winner take all autoencoders [31], sparsity is induced by using mini-batch statistics, while in the sparse access memory [37] reports some speed-up by both thresholding the memory to a sparse subset, and by using efficient data structures for content-based read operations.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: hardware efficient adaptive memory management\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. HELP: Hardware-Adaptive Efficient Latency Predictor for NAS via Meta-Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient adaptive memory management*\n\n*Hayeon Lee, Sewoong Lee, S. Chong, S. Hwang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hardware-adaptive Efficient Latency Predictor (HELP) is proposed, which formulates the device-specific latency estimation problem as a meta-learning problem, such that it can estimate the latency of a model's performance for a given task on an unseen device with a few samples.\n\n**Abstract:** For deployment, neural architecture search should be hardware-aware, in order to satisfy the device-specific constraints (e.g., memory usage, latency and energy consumption) and enhance the model efficiency. Existing methods on hardware-aware NAS collect a large number of samples (e.g., accuracy and latency) from a target device, either builds a lookup table or a latency estimator. However, such approach is impractical in real-world scenarios as there exist numerous devices with different hardware specifications, and collecting samples from such a large number of devices will require prohibitive computational and monetary cost. To overcome such limitations, we propose Hardware-adaptive Efficient Latency Predictor (HELP), which formulates the device-specific latency estimation problem as a meta-learning problem, such that we can estimate the latency of a model's performance for a given task on an unseen device with a few samples. To this end, we introduce novel hardware embeddings to embed any devices considering them as black-box functions that output latencies, and meta-learn the hardware-adaptive latency predictor in a device-dependent manner, using the hardware embeddings. We validate the proposed HELP for its latency estimation performance on unseen platforms, on which it achieves high estimation performance with as few as 10 measurement samples, outperforming all relevant baselines. We also validate end-to-end NAS frameworks using HELP against ones without it, and show that it largely reduces the total time cost of the base NAS method, in latency-constrained settings.

C. D. Mundo, Mohammad Rastegari, Mehrdad Farajtabar*\n\n**TL;DR:** The integration of sparsity awareness, context-adaptive loading, and a hardware-oriented design paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are central to modern natural language processing, delivering exceptional performance in various tasks. However, their substantial computational and memory requirements present challenges, especially for devices with limited DRAM capacity. This paper tackles the challenge of efficiently running LLMs that exceed the available DRAM capacity by storing the model parameters in flash memory, but bringing them on demand to DRAM. Our method involves constructing an inference cost model that takes into account the characteristics of flash memory, guiding us to optimize in two critical areas: reducing the volume of data transferred from flash and reading data in larger, more contiguous chunks. Within this hardware-informed framework, we introduce two principal techniques. First,\"windowing\"strategically reduces data transfer by reusing previously activated neurons, and second,\"row-column bundling\", tailored to the sequential data access strengths of flash memory, increases the size of data chunks read from flash memory. These methods collectively enable running models up to twice the size of the available DRAM, with a 4-5x and 20-25x increase in inference speed compared to naive loading approaches in CPU and GPU, respectively. Our integration of sparsity awareness, context-adaptive loading, and a hardware-oriented design paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 60  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 3. ZeroFL: Efficient On-Device Training for Federated Learning with Local Sparsity\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient adaptive memory management*\n\n*Xinchi Qiu, Javier Fern\u00e1ndez-Marqu\u00e9s, Pedro Gusm\u00e3o, Yan Gao, Titouan Parcollet, N. Lane*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents the first study on the unique aspects that arise when introducing sparsity at training time in FL workloads and proposes ZeroFL, a framework that relies on highly sparse operations to accelerate on-device training.\n\n**Abstract:** When the available hardware cannot meet the memory and compute requirements to efficiently train high performing machine learning models, a compromise in either the training quality or the model complexity is needed. In Federated Learning (FL), nodes are orders of magnitude more constrained than traditional server-grade hardware and are often battery powered, severely limiting the sophistication of models that can be trained under this paradigm. While most research has focused on designing better aggregation strategies to improve convergence rates and in alleviating the communication costs of FL, fewer efforts have been devoted to accelerating on-device training. Such stage, which repeats hundreds of times (i.e. every round) and can involve thousands of devices, accounts for the majority of the time required to train federated models and, the totality of the energy consumption at the client side. In this work, we present the first study on the unique aspects that arise when introducing sparsity at training time in FL workloads. We then propose ZeroFL, a framework that relies on highly sparse operations to accelerate on-device training. Models trained with ZeroFL and 95% sparsity achieve up to 2.3% higher accuracy compared to competitive baselines obtained from adapting a state-of-the-art sparse training framework to the FL setting.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 57  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 4. Low-rank lottery tickets: finding efficient low-rank neural networks via matrix differential equations\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient adaptive memory management*\n\n*Steffen Schotth\u00f6fer, Emanuele Zangrando, J. Kusch, Gianluca Ceruti, Francesco Tudisco*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks that are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks have achieved tremendous success in a large variety of applications. However, their memory footprint and computational demand can render them impractical in application settings with limited hardware or energy resources. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks. Remarkably, these subnetworks are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced. The main idea is to restrict the weight matrices to a low-rank manifold and to update the low-rank factors rather than the full matrix during training. To derive training updates that are restricted to the prescribed manifold, we employ techniques from dynamic model order reduction for matrix differential equations. This allows us to provide approximation, stability, and descent guarantees. Moreover, our method automatically and dynamically adapts the ranks during training to achieve the desired approximation accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through a variety of numerical experiments on fully-connected and convolutional networks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

FedML Parrot: A Scalable Federated Learning System via Heterogeneity-aware Scheduling on Sequential and Hierarchical Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient adaptive memory management*\n\n*Chaoyang He, Salman Avestimehr, Alex Qiaozhong Liang, Yuxin Wang, Yonggang Zhang, Shaohuai Shi, Sunwoo Lee, Ryan Yide Ran, Xiaowen Chu, Zhenheng Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborations among clients for train machine learning models while protecting their data privacy. Existing FL simulation platforms that are designed from the perspectives of traditional distributed training, suffer from laborious code migration between simulation and production, low efficiency, low GPU utility, low scalability with high hardware requirements and difficulty of simulating stateful clients. In this work, we firstly demystify the challenges and bottlenecks of simulating FL, and design a new FL system named as FedML \\texttt{Parrot}. It improves the training efficiency, remarkably relaxes the requirements on the hardware, and supports efficient large-scale FL experiments with stateful clients by: (1) sequential training clients on devices; (2) decomposing original aggregation into local and global aggregation on devices and server respectively; (3) scheduling tasks to mitigate straggler problems and enhance computing utility; (4) distributed client state manager to support various FL algorithms. Besides, built upon our generic APIs and communication interfaces, users can seamlessly transform the simulation into the real-world deployment without modifying codes. We evaluate \\texttt{Parrot} through extensive experiments for training diverse models on various FL datasets to demonstrate that \\texttt{Parrot} can achieve simulating over 1000 clients (stateful or stateless) with flexible GPU devices setting ($4 \\sim 32$) and high GPU utility, 1.2 $\\sim$ 4 times faster than FedScale, and 10 $\\sim$ 100 times memory saving than FedML. And we verify that \\texttt{Parrot} works well with homogeneous and heterogeneous devices in three different clusters. Two FL algorithms with stateful clients and four algorithms with stateless clients are simulated to verify the wide adaptability of \\texttt{Parrot} to different algorithms.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-03\n\n\n\n#### 2. MF-NeRF: Memory Efficient NeRF with Mixed-Feature Hash Table\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient adaptive memory management*\n\n*Deliang Fan, Li Yang, YongJae lee*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural radiance field (NeRF) has shown remarkable performance in generating photo-realistic novel views. Among recent NeRF related research, the approaches that involve the utilization of explicit structures like grids to manage features achieve exceptionally fast training by reducing the complexity of multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks. However, storing features in dense grids demands a substantial amount of memory space, resulting in a notable memory bottleneck within computer system. Consequently, it leads to a significant increase in training times without prior hyper-parameter tuning. To address this issue, in this work, we are the first to propose MF-NeRF, a memory-efficient NeRF framework that employs a Mixed-Feature hash table to improve memory efficiency and reduce training time while maintaining reconstruction quality. Specifically, we first design a mixed-feature hash encoding to adaptively mix part of multi-level feature grids and map it to a single hash table. Following that, in order to obtain the correct index of a grid point, we further develop an index transformation method that transforms indices of an arbitrary level grid to those of a canonical grid. Extensive experiments benchmarking with state-of-the-art Instant-NGP, TensoRF, and DVGO, indicate our MF-NeRF could achieve the fastest training time on the same GPU hardware with similar or even higher reconstruction quality.\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-25\n\n\n\n#### 3. R^3: On-device Real-Time Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Robotics\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient adaptive memory management*\n\n*Cong Liu, Hyoseung Kim, Andrea Soltoggio, Yufei Li, Aritra Samanta, Zexin Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Autonomous robotic systems, like autonomous vehicles and robotic search and rescue, require efficient on-device training for continuous adaptation of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models in dynamic environments. This research is fundamentally motivated by the need to understand and address the challenges of on-device real-time DRL, which involves balancing timing and algorithm performance under memory constraints, as exposed through our extensive empirical studies. This intricate balance requires co-optimizing two pivotal parameters of DRL training -- batch size and replay buffer size. Configuring these parameters significantly affects timing and algorithm performance, while both (unfortunately) require substantial memory allocation to achieve near-optimal performance. This paper presents R^3, a holistic solution for managing timing, memory, and algorithm performance in on-device real-time DRL training. R^3 employs (i) a deadline-driven feedback loop with dynamic batch sizing for optimizing timing, (ii) efficient memory management to reduce memory footprint and allow larger replay buffer sizes, and (iii) a runtime coordinator guided by heuristic analysis and a runtime profiler for dynamically adjusting memory resource reservations. These components collaboratively tackle the trade-offs in on-device DRL training, improving timing and algorithm performance while minimizing the risk of out-of-memory (OOM) errors. We implemented and evaluated R^3 extensively across various DRL frameworks and benchmarks on three hardware platforms commonly adopted by autonomous robotic systems. Additionally, we integrate R^3 with a popular realistic autonomous car simulator to demonstrate its real-world applicability. Evaluation results show that R^3 achieves efficacy across diverse platforms, ensuring consistent latency performance and timing predictability with minimal overhead.\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design with a focus on hardware-efficient implementations of adaptive memory management, here are some key insights and relevant techniques from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Memory-Efficient Training and Inference\n\nThe paper \"NeuZip: Memory-Efficient Training and Inference with Dynamic Compression\" introduces an algorithm that compresses neural networks while maintaining their full capabilities. This approach involves compressing each floating-point number in the network, which can significantly reduce memory usage during both training and inference. This technique is particularly relevant for balancing memory usage with computational efficiency in neural networks.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Architectures\n\nThe study on \"Dynamic Power Control in a Hardware Neural Network\" highlights the use of approximate computing techniques to enhance the efficiency of neural networks. By incorporating approximate multipliers with configurable error and power within the MAC units of neurons, this design achieves substantial power savings while maintaining acceptable accuracy. This approach can be adapted to larger neural network architectures, including autoregressive models, to optimize memory and computational efficiency.\n\n## Memristor-Based In-Memory Computing\n\nThe paper on \"Efficient memristor accelerator for transformer self-attention\" presents a hardware accelerator using memristor-based in-memory computing. This design integrates computation into memory, reducing data transfer time and latency. The use of memristor crossbar arrays for matrix operations can be highly efficient for attention mechanisms in transformers, which are often used in autoregressive language models. This approach can help in optimizing memory usage and computational efficiency by leveraging analog computing and reducing the need for data movement.\n\n## Hierarchical and Chunked Processing\n\nThe analysis note mentions several strategies such as hierarchical decomposition, bounded-memory control, and chunked processing. These techniques can be applied to autoregressive models to manage long sequences efficiently. For example, hierarchical attention mechanisms and chunked attention computation can help in reducing memory complexity and improving hardware utilization. These strategies are crucial for maintaining causal structure and adapting memory bounds to sequence characteristics[Analysis Note].\n\n## Integration and Optimization\n\nTo integrate geometric and hierarchical features, techniques like H-Matrix principles and bounded-memory control can be unified through chunked processing. This integration can enhance hierarchical normalization and structure geometric relationships efficiently. Additionally, performance optimization approaches such as linear-time attention implementations and divide-and-conquer strategies can further improve hardware efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\nBy combining these approaches, researchers can develop hardware-efficient adaptive memory management techniques for autoregressive language models, focusing on:\n\n- **Dynamic compression** to reduce memory usage during training and inference.\n- **Approximate computing** to optimize power consumption and maintain accuracy.\n- **Memristor-based in-memory computing** to integrate computation into memory and reduce latency.\n- **Hierarchical and chunked processing** to manage long sequences efficiently and optimize hardware utilization.\n\nThese strategies can help in achieving better overall performance, scalability, and efficiency in autoregressive language models.\n",

Funnel-Transformer: Filtering out Sequential Redundancy for Efficient Language Processing (Avg. Score: 0.13)\n\n*Zihang Dai, Guokun Lai, Yiming Yang, Quoc V. Le*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2020)\t**Cited by** 199  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Funnel-Transformer, a model which gradually compresses the sequence of hidden states to a shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost and outperforms the standard Transformer on a wide variety of sequence-level prediction tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** With the success of language pretraining, it is highly desirable to develop more efficient architectures of good scalability that can exploit the abundant unlabeled data at a lower cost. To improve the efficiency, we examine the much-overlooked redundancy in maintaining a full-length token-level presentation, especially for tasks that only require a single-vector presentation of the sequence. With this intuition, we propose Funnel-Transformer which gradually compresses the sequence of hidden states to a shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost. More importantly, by re-investing the saved FLOPs from length reduction in constructing a deeper or wider model, we further improve the model capacity. In addition, to perform token-level predictions as required by common pretraining objectives, Funnel-Transformer is able to recover a deep representation for each token from the reduced hidden sequence via a decoder. Empirically, with comparable or fewer FLOPs, Funnel-Transformer outperforms the standard Transformer on a wide variety of sequence-level prediction tasks, including text classification, language understanding, and reading comprehension.

Klambauer, Johannes Brandstetter, Sepp Hochreiter*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n**Abstract:** In the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced as the central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 50/97 (Score: 0.12)*\n\n```\nArXiv, 2404.05892, 2024.

Score: 0.09)\n\n*Hubert Ramsauer, Bernhard Schafl, Johannes Lehner, Philipp Seidl, Michael Widrich, Lukas Gruber, Markus Holzleitner, Milena Pavlovi'c, G. K. Sandve, Victor Greiff, David P. Kreil, Michael Kopp, G. Klambauer, Johannes Brandstetter, Sepp Hochreiter*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2020)\t**Cited by** 313  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new PyTorch layer is provided, called \"Hopfield\", which allows to equip deep learning architectures with modern Hopfield networks as a new powerful concept comprising pooling, memory, and attention.\n\n**Abstract:** We show that the transformer attention mechanism is the update rule of a modern Hopfield network with continuous states. This new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension) many patterns, converges with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. The number of stored patterns is traded off against convergence speed and retrieval error. The new Hopfield network has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. Transformer and BERT models operate in their first layers preferably in the global averaging regime, while they operate in higher layers in metastable states. The gradient in transformers is maximal for metastable states, is uniformly distributed for global averaging, and vanishes for a fixed point near a stored pattern. Using the Hopfield network interpretation, we analyzed learning of transformer and BERT models. Learning starts with attention heads that average and then most of them switch to metastable states. However, the majority of heads in the first layers still averages and can be replaced by averaging, e.g. our proposed Gaussian weighting. In contrast, heads in the last layers steadily learn and seem to use metastable states to collect information created in lower layers. These heads seem to be a promising target for improving transformers. Neural networks with Hopfield networks outperform other methods on immune repertoire classification, where the Hopfield net stores several hundreds of thousands of patterns. We provide a new PyTorch layer called \"Hopfield\", which allows to equip deep learning architectures with modern Hopfield networks as a new powerful concept comprising pooling, memory, and attention.

Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/94 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\nIEEE, 2015. [3] J. Abreu, L. Fred, D. Mac\u00eado, and C. Zanchettin.

All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/35 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 190-196, 1999.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical geometric processing tensor optimization*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model by incorporating hierarchical and geometric processing, and focusing on tensor-based optimizations and efficient implementation strategies, here are some relevant insights and techniques:\n\n## Hierarchical Processing and Geometric Patterns\n\n### Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (h-GNN)\nThe paper on \"Hierarchical Graph Neural Network: A Lightweight Image Matching Model\" provides insights into hierarchical processing. Although it is focused on image matching, the concepts can be adapted to other domains. The h-GNN uses a hierarchical clustering method (SC+PCA) to create successive hierarchies of graphs, preserving both local and global information. This hierarchical approach can be analogous to processing in language models, where hierarchical representations of text can be built and refined through successive layers.\n\n### Application to Language Models\nIn the context of language models, hierarchical processing can involve creating nested representations of text, similar to the hierarchical graphs in h-GNN. This can be achieved by using transformer layers that progressively refine and aggregate information from lower to higher levels of abstraction.\n\n## Geometric Processing and Tensor Optimizations\n\n### Geometric Graph Neural Networks (Geom-GNNs)\nThe paper \"Pushing the Limits of All-Atom Geometric Graph Neural Networks\" discusses Geom-GNNs, which incorporate geometric information into the graph neural network architecture. While this work is focused on molecular force fields, the idea of integrating geometric information can be extended to language models. Geometric processing in language models could involve representing text data in a geometric space, allowing for more efficient and meaningful interactions between tokens.\n\n### Tensor-Based Optimizations\nThe use of tensor cores for efficient matrix operations, as mentioned in the analysis, is crucial. Papers like \"FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores\" highlight how tensor cores can be leveraged for efficient computations. This can be applied to language models by optimizing the matrix operations within transformer layers using tensor cores, which can significantly improve computational efficiency.\n\n## Implementation Strategies and Unified Memory Management\n\n### Efficient Matrix Operations\nCombining hierarchical processing with geometric patterns through efficient matrix operations is key. Techniques like those described in \"FlashFFTConv\" can be adapted to optimize the matrix multiplications within transformer layers, enabling longer sequence processing and reducing I/O overhead.\n\n### Adaptive Memory Management\nImplementing adaptive memory management with bounded controls, as suggested in the analysis, can help in managing the memory hierarchy efficiently. This can be combined with hierarchical processing to ensure that the model's memory usage is optimized at each level of the hierarchy.\n\n### Unified Memory Management\nThe concept of product key memory for large-scale capacity, as mentioned in \"Large Memory Layers with Product Keys,\" can be integrated with hierarchical and geometric processing.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/38 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2307.03170, 2023.

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 50/56 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1609.08144, 2016.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.79)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Generalist Equivariant Transformer Towards 3D Molecular Interaction Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization geometric attention integration*\n\n*Xiangzhe Kong, Wen-bing Huang, Yang Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper first proposes to universally represent an arbitrary 3D complex as a geometric graph of sets, shedding light on encoding all types of molecules with one model, and proposes a Generalist Equivariant Transformer (GET) to effectively capture both domain-specific hierarchies and domain-agnostic interaction physics.\n\n**Abstract:** Many processes in biology and drug discovery involve various 3D interactions between molecules, such as protein and protein, protein and small molecule, etc. Given that different molecules are usually represented in different granularity, existing methods usually encode each type of molecules independently with different models, leaving it defective to learn the various underlying interaction physics. In this paper, we first propose to universally represent an arbitrary 3D complex as a geometric graph of sets, shedding light on encoding all types of molecules with one model. We then propose a Generalist Equivariant Transformer (GET) to effectively capture both domain-specific hierarchies and domain-agnostic interaction physics. To be specific, GET consists of a bilevel attention module, a feed-forward module and a layer normalization module, where each module is E(3) equivariant and specialized for handling sets of variable sizes. Notably, in contrast to conventional pooling-based hierarchical models, our GET is able to retain fine-grained information of all levels. Extensive experiments on the interactions between proteins, small molecules and RNA/DNAs verify the effectiveness and generalization capability of our proposed method across different domains.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. Direct Multi-view Multi-person 3D Pose Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization geometric attention integration*\n\n*Tao Wang, Jianfeng Zhang, Yujun Cai, Shuicheng Yan, Jiashi Feng*\n\n**TL;DR:** The MvP model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks while being much more efficient, and achieves 92.3% AP25 on the challenging Panoptic dataset, improving upon the previous best approach by 9.8%.\n\n**Abstract:** We present Multi-view Pose transformer (MvP) for estimating multi-person 3D poses from multi-view images. Instead of estimating 3D joint locations from costly volumetric representation or reconstructing the per-person 3D pose from multiple detected 2D poses as in previous methods, MvP directly regresses the multi-person 3D poses in a clean and efficient way, without relying on intermediate tasks. Specifically, MvP represents skeleton joints as learnable query embeddings and let them progressively attend to and reason over the multi-view information from the input images to directly regress the actual 3D joint locations. To improve the accuracy of such a simple pipeline, MvP presents a hierarchical scheme to concisely represent query embeddings of multi-person skeleton joints and introduces an input-dependent query adaptation approach. Further, MvP designs a novel geometrically guided attention mechanism, called projective attention, to more precisely fuse the cross-view information for each joint. MvP also introduces a RayConv operation to integrate the view-dependent camera geometry into the feature representations for augmenting the projective attention. We show experimentally that our MvP model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks while being much more efficient. Notably, it achieves 92.3% AP25 on the challenging Panoptic dataset, improving upon the previous best approach [36] by 9.8%. MvP is general and also extendable to recovering human mesh represented by the SMPL model, thus useful for modeling multi-person body shapes.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores\n\n*From Search Query: tensor cores optimized transformer architectures*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. TpuGraphs: A Performance Prediction Dataset on Large Tensor Computational Graphs\n\n*From Search Query: tensor cores optimized transformer architectures*\n\n*P. Phothilimthana, Sami Abu-El-Haija, Kaidi Cao, Bahare Fatemi, Charith Mendis, Bryan Perozzi*\n\n**TL;DR:** TpuGraphs is introduced, a performance prediction dataset on full tensor programs, represented as computational graphs, running on Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and provides 25x more graphs than the largest graph property prediction dataset, and 770x larger graphs on average compared to existing performance prediction datasets on machine learning programs.\n\n**Abstract:** Precise hardware performance models play a crucial role in code optimizations. They can assist compilers in making heuristic decisions or aid autotuners in identifying the optimal configuration for a given program. For example, the autotuner for XLA, a machine learning compiler, discovered 10-20% speedup on state-of-the-art models serving substantial production traffic at Google. Although there exist a few datasets for program performance prediction, they target small sub-programs such as basic blocks or kernels. This paper introduces TpuGraphs, a performance prediction dataset on full tensor programs, represented as computational graphs, running on Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Each graph in the dataset represents the main computation of a machine learning workload, e.g., a training epoch or an inference step. Each data sample contains a computational graph, a compilation configuration, and the execution time of the graph when compiled with the configuration. The graphs in the dataset are collected from open-source machine learning programs, featuring popular model architectures, e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet, Mask R-CNN, and Transformer. TpuGraphs provides 25x more graphs than the largest graph property prediction dataset (with comparable graph sizes), and 770x larger graphs on average compared to existing performance prediction datasets on machine learning programs. This graph-level prediction task on large graphs introduces new challenges in learning, ranging from scalability, training efficiency, to model quality.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5. Hyena Hierarchy: Towards Larger Convolutional Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: tensor cores optimized transformer architectures*\n\n*Michael Poli, Stefano Massaroli, Eric Q. Nguyen, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao, S. Baccus, Y. Bengio, Stefano Ermon, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating, and sets a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 212  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Efficient Quantized Sparse Matrix Operations on Tensor Cores\n\n*From Search Query: tensor cores optimized transformer architectures*\n\n*Torsten Hoefler, Kazuki Osawa, Shigang Li*\n\n**Abstract:** The exponentially growing model size drives the continued success of deep learning, but it brings prohibitive computation and memory cost. From the algorithm perspective, model sparsification and quantization have been studied to alleviate the problem. From the architecture perspective, hardware vendors provide Tensor cores for acceleration. However, it is very challenging to gain practical speedups from sparse, low-precision matrix operations on Tensor cores, because of the strict requirements for data layout and lack of support for efficiently manipulating the low-precision integers. We propose Magicube, a high-performance sparse-matrix library for low-precision integers on Tensor cores. Magicube supports SpMM and SDDMM, two major sparse operations in deep learning with mixed precision. Experimental results on an NVIDIA A100 GPU show that Magicube achieves on average 1.44x (up to 2.37x) speedup over the vendor-optimized library for sparse kernels, and 1.43x speedup over the state-of-the-art with a comparable accuracy for end-to-end sparse Transformer inference.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-14\n\n\n\n#### 2. OliVe: Accelerating Large Language Models via Hardware-friendly Outlier-Victim Pair Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: tensor cores optimized transformer architectures*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success with the growing model size. LLMs' size grows by $240\\times$ every two years, which outpaces the hardware progress and makes model inference increasingly costly. Model quantization is a promising approach to mitigate the widening gap between LLM size and hardware capacity. However, the existence of outliers, values with significant magnitudes, in LLMs makes existing quantization methods less effective. Prior outlier-aware quantization schemes adopt sparsity encoding techniques to separate outliers from normal values where the process requires global coordination (e.g., a global sparsity coordination list). This incurs complex encoding/decoding hardware logics and an extra orchestration controller for the computation between outlier and normal values. As such, it is not hardware-efficient and hence only achieves sub-optimal quantization benefits. We propose OliVe, an algorithm/architecture co-designed solution that adopts an outlier-victim pair (OVP) quantization and handles outlier values locally with low hardware overheads and high performance gains. The key insight of OliVe is that outliers are important while the normal values next to them are not. Thus those normal values (called victims) can be sacrificed to accommodate outliers. This enables a memory-aligned OVP encoding scheme, which can be efficiently integrated to the existing hardware accelerators like systolic array and tensor core. As a result, OliVe-based accelerator surpasses the existing outlier-aware accelerator, GOBO, by 4.5$\\times$ speedup and 4.0$\\times$ energy reduction, respectively, with a superior model accuracy.\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher is aiming to design a novel autoregressive language model block, termed **HierarchicalGeometricGPT**, by integrating several innovative components:\n- **HierarchicalRMSNorm**: A hierarchical normalization technique.\n- **GeometricGatedMHA**: A geometric-aware multi-head attention mechanism.\n- **Tensor-optimized hierarchical processing**: Utilizing tensor cores for efficient matrix operations.\n- **Unified memory management**: Managing memory efficiently to handle long sequences.\n\nHere are the key points and the most relevant information to support the researcher's goals:\n\n### Novelty and Feasibility\n\n- The proposal combines hierarchical normalization with geometric attention, which is a novel integration.

Summary of Analysis\n\nThe **HierarchicalGeometricGPT** proposal aims to integrate **HierarchicalRMSNorm** from Parent 1 with **GeometricGatedMHA** from Parent 2 to enhance the efficiency, expressiveness, and scalability of autoregressive language model blocks. The key innovations include tensor-optimized hierarchical processing, geometric-aware normalization, and unified memory management. \n\nThrough an extensive review of internal and external sources, it becomes evident that while elements such as hierarchical normalization, geometric attention, and tensor optimizations have been individually explored, their combined integration as proposed in **HierarchicalGeometricGPT** remains largely unexplored. Existing works like **Griffin** and **H-Transformer-1D** demonstrate the feasibility of integrating hierarchical structures with attention mechanisms, and **FlashFFTConv** highlights the potential of tensor optimizations for efficient matrix operations. However, a direct amalgamation of hierarchical normalization with geometric attention mechanisms in the context of language models has not been thoroughly investigated, indicating significant novelty in the proposal.\n\nAdditionally, the integration aligns well with current research trends focusing on improving transformer efficiency, scalability, and handling long sequences.

Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.43)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.43)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.13)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Score: 0.05)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/38 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2307.03170, 2023.

Generalist Equivariant Transformer Towards 3D Molecular Interaction Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization geometric attention tensor optimization*\n\n*Xiangzhe Kong, Wen-bing Huang, Yang Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper first proposes to universally represent an arbitrary 3D complex as a geometric graph of sets, shedding light on encoding all types of molecules with one model, and proposes a Generalist Equivariant Transformer (GET) to effectively capture both domain-specific hierarchies and domain-agnostic interaction physics.\n\n**Abstract:** Many processes in biology and drug discovery involve various 3D interactions between molecules, such as protein and protein, protein and small molecule, etc. Given that different molecules are usually represented in different granularity, existing methods usually encode each type of molecules independently with different models, leaving it defective to learn the various underlying interaction physics. In this paper, we first propose to universally represent an arbitrary 3D complex as a geometric graph of sets, shedding light on encoding all types of molecules with one model. We then propose a Generalist Equivariant Transformer (GET) to effectively capture both domain-specific hierarchies and domain-agnostic interaction physics. To be specific, GET consists of a bilevel attention module, a feed-forward module and a layer normalization module, where each module is E(3) equivariant and specialized for handling sets of variable sizes. Notably, in contrast to conventional pooling-based hierarchical models, our GET is able to retain fine-grained information of all levels.

We study how to initialize and regularize deep nets containing such layers, examining two simple, understudied schemes, spectral initialization and Frobenius decay, for improving their performance. The guiding insight is to design optimization routines for these networks that are as close as possible to that of their well-tuned, non-decomposed counterparts; we back this intuition with an analysis of how the initialization and regularization schemes impact training with gradient descent, drawing on modern attempts to understand the interplay of weight-decay and batch-normalization. Empirically, we highlight the benefits of spectral initialization and Frobenius decay across a variety of settings. In model compression, we show that they enable low-rank methods to significantly outperform both unstructured sparsity and tensor methods on the task of training low-memory residual networks; analogs of the schemes also improve the performance of tensor decomposition techniques. For knowledge distillation, Frobenius decay enables a simple, overcomplete baseline that yields a compact model from over-parameterized training without requiring retraining with or pruning a teacher network. Finally, we show how both schemes applied to multi-head attention lead to improved performance on both translation and unsupervised pre-training.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 49  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing and evaluating the **HierarchicalGeometricGPT** model, here are some key areas and specific information that need to be focused on:\n\n### 1. **Hierarchical Normalization and Geometric Attention**\n\n- **Existing Work**:\n  -

However, their original formulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched transformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to address these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating architectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data and compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is limited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a cost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose Scalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to uptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong pre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring 5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent in-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest linear models.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores\n\n*From Search Query: tensor optimization efficient transformers*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3.

Supernet-based one-shot neural architecture search (NAS) enables fast architecture optimization and has achieved state-of-the-art results on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, directly applying the supernet-based NAS to optimize ViTs leads to poor performance - even worse compared to training single ViTs. In this work, we observe that the poor performance is due to a gradient con\ufb02ict issue: the gradients of different sub-networks con\ufb02ict with that of the supernet more severely in ViTs than CNNs, which leads to early saturation in training and inferior convergence. To alleviate this issue, we propose a series of techniques, including a gradient projection algorithm, a switchable layer scaling design, and a simpli\ufb01ed data augmentation and regularization training recipe.

However, the performances of LLMs depend heavily on the instructions given to them, which are typically manually tuned with substantial human efforts. Recent work has used the query-efficient Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm to automatically optimize the instructions given to black-box LLMs. However, BO usually falls short when optimizing highly sophisticated (e.g., high-dimensional) objective functions, such as the functions mapping an instruction to the performance of an LLM. This is mainly due to the limited expressive power of the Gaussian process (GP) which is used by BO as a surrogate to model the objective function. Meanwhile, it has been repeatedly shown that neural networks (NNs), especially pre-trained transformers, possess strong expressive power and can model highly complex functions. So, we adopt a neural bandit algorithm which replaces the GP in BO by an NN surrogate to optimize instructions for black-box LLMs. More importantly, the neural bandit algorithm allows us to naturally couple the NN surrogate with the hidden representation learned by a pre-trained transformer (i.e., an open-source LLM), which significantly boosts its performance. These motivate us to propose our INSTruction optimization usIng Neural bandits Coupled with Transformers (INSTINCT) algorithm. We perform instruction optimization for ChatGPT and use extensive experiments to show that INSTINCT consistently outperforms baselines in different tasks, e.g., various instruction induction tasks and the task of improving zero-shot chain-of-thought instructions.

Towards A Unified View of Sparse Feed-Forward Network in Pretraining Large Language Model\n\n*From Search Query: unified memory management transformers*\n\n*Leo Liu, Tim Dettmers, Xi Victoria Lin, Ves Stoyanov, Xian Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simpler selection method is found that selects blocks through their mean aggregated hidden states, achieving lower perplexity in language model pretraining compared to existing MoE architectures including Switch Transformer and HashLayer.\n\n**Abstract:** Large and sparse feed-forward layers (S-FFN) such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have proven effective in scaling up Transformers model size for \\textit{pretraining} large language models. By only activating part of the FFN parameters conditioning on input, S-FFN improves generalization performance while keeping training and inference costs (in FLOPs) fixed. In this work, we analyzed two major design choices of S-FFN: the memory block (a.k.a. expert) size and the memory block selection method under a general conceptual framework of sparse neural memory. Using this unified framework, we compare several S-FFN architectures for language modeling and provide insights into their relative efficacy and efficiency. We found a simpler selection method -- \\textbf{\\texttt{Avg-K}} that selects blocks through their mean aggregated hidden states, achieving lower perplexity in language model pretraining compared to existing MoE architectures including Switch Transformer (Fedus et al., 2021) and HashLayer (Roller et al., 2021).\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Chasing Sparsity in Vision Transformers: An End-to-End Exploration\n\n*From Search Query: unified memory management transformers*\n\n*Tianlong Chen, Yu Cheng, Zhe Gan, Lu Yuan, Lei Zhang, Zhangyang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The first-of-its-kind comprehensive exploration of a unified approach of integrating sparsity in ViTs from end to end is carried out, and it is found that the proposed sparse (co-)training can sometimes improve the ViT accuracy rather than compromising it, making sparsity a tantalizing\"free lunch\".\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently received explosive popularity, but their enormous model sizes and training costs remain daunting. Conventional post-training pruning often incurs higher training budgets. In contrast, this paper aims to trim down both the training memory overhead and the inference complexity, without sacrificing the achievable accuracy. We carry out the first-of-its-kind comprehensive exploration, on taking a unified approach of integrating sparsity in ViTs\"from end to end\". Specifically, instead of training full ViTs, we dynamically extract and train sparse subnetworks, while sticking to a fixed small parameter budget. Our approach jointly optimizes model parameters and explores connectivity throughout training, ending up with one sparse network as the final output. The approach is seamlessly extended from unstructured to structured sparsity, the latter by considering to guide the prune-and-grow of self-attention heads inside ViTs. We further co-explore data and architecture sparsity for additional efficiency gains by plugging in a novel learnable token selector to adaptively determine the currently most vital patches. Extensive results on ImageNet with diverse ViT backbones validate the effectiveness of our proposals which obtain significantly reduced computational cost and almost unimpaired generalization. Perhaps most surprisingly, we find that the proposed sparse (co-)training can sometimes improve the ViT accuracy rather than compromising it, making sparsity a tantalizing\"free lunch\". For example, our sparsified DeiT-Small at (5%, 50%) sparsity for (data, architecture), improves 0.28% top-1 accuracy, and meanwhile enjoys 49.32% FLOPs and 4.40% running time savings.

Approximating Two-Layer Feedforward Networks for Efficient Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: unified memory management transformers*\n\n*R'obert Csord'as, Kazuki Irie, J.

Many recent works use sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) to build resource-efficient large language models (LMs). Here we introduce several novel perspectives on MoEs, presenting a general framework that unifies various methods to approximate two-layer NNs (e.g., feedforward blocks of Transformers), including product-key memories (PKMs). Leveraging insights from this framework, we propose methods to improve both MoEs and PKMs. Unlike prior work that compares MoEs with dense baselines under the compute-equal condition, our evaluation condition is parameter-equal, which is crucial to properly evaluate LMs. We show that our MoEs are competitive with the dense Transformer-XL on both the WikiText-103 and enwiki8 datasets at two different scales, while being much more resource efficient. This demonstrates that MoEs are relevant not only to extremely large LMs but also to any-scale resource-efficient LMs. Our code is public.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. DeepSpeed Ulysses: System Optimizations for Enabling Training of Extreme Long Sequence Transformer Models\n\n*From Search Query: tensor optimization efficient transformers*\n\n*Shuaiwen Leon Song, Yuxiong He, Samyam Rajbhandari, Minjia Zhang, Chengming Zhang, Masahiro Tanaka, Sam Ade Jacobs*\n\n**Abstract:** Computation in a typical Transformer-based large language model (LLM) can be characterized by batch size, hidden dimension, number of layers, and sequence length. Until now, system works for accelerating LLM training have focused on the first three dimensions: data parallelism for batch size, tensor parallelism for hidden size and pipeline parallelism for model depth or layers. These widely studied forms of parallelism are not targeted or optimized for long sequence Transformer models. Given practical application needs for long sequence LLM, renewed attentions are being drawn to sequence parallelism. However, existing works in sequence parallelism are constrained by memory-communication inefficiency, limiting their scalability to long sequence large models. In this work, we introduce DeepSpeed-Ulysses, a novel, portable and effective methodology for enabling highly efficient and scalable LLM training with extremely long sequence length. DeepSpeed-Ulysses at its core partitions input data along the sequence dimension and employs an efficient all-to-all collective communication for attention computation. Theoretical communication analysis shows that whereas other methods incur communication overhead as sequence length increases, DeepSpeed-Ulysses maintains constant communication volume when sequence length and compute devices are increased proportionally. Furthermore, experimental evaluations show that DeepSpeed-Ulysses trains 2.5x faster with 4x longer sequence length than the existing method SOTA baseline.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-25\n\n\n\n#### 2. Zipformer: A faster and better encoder for automatic speech recognition\n\n*From Search Query: tensor optimization efficient transformers*\n\n*Daniel Povey, Long Lin, Zengrui Jin, Yifan Yang, Fangjun Kuang, Wei Kang, Xiaoyu Yang, Liyong Guo, Zengwei Yao*\n\n**Abstract:** The Conformer has become the most popular encoder model for automatic speech recognition (ASR). It adds convolution modules to a transformer to learn both local and global dependencies. In this work we describe a faster, more memory-efficient, and better-performing transformer, called Zipformer. Modeling changes include: 1) a U-Net-like encoder structure where middle stacks operate at lower frame rates; 2) reorganized block structure with more modules, within which we re-use attention weights for efficiency; 3) a modified form of LayerNorm called BiasNorm allows us to retain some length information; 4) new activation functions SwooshR and SwooshL work better than Swish. We also propose a new optimizer, called ScaledAdam, which scales the update by each tensor's current scale to keep the relative change about the same, and also explictly learns the parameter scale. It achieves faster convergence and better performance than Adam. Extensive experiments on LibriSpeech, Aishell-1, and WenetSpeech datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Zipformer over other state-of-the-art ASR models.

Although there exist various methods devoted to enhancing the long-context processing ability of LLMs, they are developed in an isolated manner and lack systematic analysis and integration of their strengths, hindering further developments. In this paper, we introduce UniMem, a Unified framework that reformulates existing long-context methods from the view of Memory augmentation of LLMs. Distinguished by its four core dimensions-Memory Management, Memory Writing, Memory Reading, and Memory Injection, UniMem empowers researchers to conduct systematic exploration of long-context methods. We re-formulate 16 existing methods based on UniMem and analyze four representative methods: Transformer-XL, Memorizing Transformer, RMT, and Longformer into equivalent UniMem forms to reveal their design principles and strengths. Based on these analyses, we propose UniMix, an innovative approach that integrates the strengths of these algorithms. Experimental results show that UniMix achieves superior performance in handling long contexts with significantly lower perplexity than baselines.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-05\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher is aiming to develop a novel autoregressive language model block, termed **HierarchicalGeometricGPT**, which integrates **HierarchicalRMSNorm** and **GeometricGatedMHA** to enhance efficiency, expressiveness, and scalability.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/38 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2307.03170, 2023.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Generalist Equivariant Transformer Towards 3D Molecular Interaction Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization geometric attention integration*\n\n*Xiangzhe Kong, Wen-bing Huang, Yang Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper first proposes to universally represent an arbitrary 3D complex as a geometric graph of sets, shedding light on encoding all types of molecules with one model, and proposes a Generalist Equivariant Transformer (GET) to effectively capture both domain-specific hierarchies and domain-agnostic interaction physics.\n\n**Abstract:** Many processes in biology and drug discovery involve various 3D interactions between molecules, such as protein and protein, protein and small molecule, etc. Given that different molecules are usually represented in different granularity, existing methods usually encode each type of molecules independently with different models, leaving it defective to learn the various underlying interaction physics. In this paper, we first propose to universally represent an arbitrary 3D complex as a geometric graph of sets, shedding light on encoding all types of molecules with one model. We then propose a Generalist Equivariant Transformer (GET) to effectively capture both domain-specific hierarchies and domain-agnostic interaction physics. To be specific, GET consists of a bilevel attention module, a feed-forward module and a layer normalization module, where each module is E(3) equivariant and specialized for handling sets of variable sizes. Notably, in contrast to conventional pooling-based hierarchical models, our GET is able to retain fine-grained information of all levels. Extensive experiments on the interactions between proteins, small molecules and RNA/DNAs verify the effectiveness and generalization capability of our proposed method across different domains.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. Direct Multi-view Multi-person 3D Pose Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization geometric attention integration*\n\n*Tao Wang, Jianfeng Zhang, Yujun Cai, Shuicheng Yan, Jiashi Feng*\n\n**TL;DR:** The MvP model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks while being much more efficient, and achieves 92.3% AP25 on the challenging Panoptic dataset, improving upon the previous best approach by 9.8%.\n\n**Abstract:** We present Multi-view Pose transformer (MvP) for estimating multi-person 3D poses from multi-view images. Instead of estimating 3D joint locations from costly volumetric representation or reconstructing the per-person 3D pose from multiple detected 2D poses as in previous methods, MvP directly regresses the multi-person 3D poses in a clean and efficient way, without relying on intermediate tasks. Specifically, MvP represents skeleton joints as learnable query embeddings and let them progressively attend to and reason over the multi-view information from the input images to directly regress the actual 3D joint locations. To improve the accuracy of such a simple pipeline, MvP presents a hierarchical scheme to concisely represent query embeddings of multi-person skeleton joints and introduces an input-dependent query adaptation approach. Further, MvP designs a novel geometrically guided attention mechanism, called projective attention, to more precisely fuse the cross-view information for each joint. MvP also introduces a RayConv operation to integrate the view-dependent camera geometry into the feature representations for augmenting the projective attention. We show experimentally that our MvP model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks while being much more efficient. Notably, it achieves 92.3% AP25 on the challenging Panoptic dataset, improving upon the previous best approach [36] by 9.8%. MvP is general and also extendable to recovering human mesh represented by the SMPL model, thus useful for modeling multi-person body shapes.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores\n\n*From Search Query: tensor cores optimized transformer architectures*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. TpuGraphs: A Performance Prediction Dataset on Large Tensor Computational Graphs\n\n*From Search Query: tensor cores optimized transformer architectures*\n\n*P.

They can assist compilers in making heuristic decisions or aid autotuners in identifying the optimal configuration for a given program. For example, the autotuner for XLA, a machine learning compiler, discovered 10-20% speedup on state-of-the-art models serving substantial production traffic at Google. Although there exist a few datasets for program performance prediction, they target small sub-programs such as basic blocks or kernels. This paper introduces TpuGraphs, a performance prediction dataset on full tensor programs, represented as computational graphs, running on Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Each graph in the dataset represents the main computation of a machine learning workload, e.g., a training epoch or an inference step. Each data sample contains a computational graph, a compilation configuration, and the execution time of the graph when compiled with the configuration. The graphs in the dataset are collected from open-source machine learning programs, featuring popular model architectures, e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet, Mask R-CNN, and Transformer. TpuGraphs provides 25x more graphs than the largest graph property prediction dataset (with comparable graph sizes), and 770x larger graphs on average compared to existing performance prediction datasets on machine learning programs. This graph-level prediction task on large graphs introduces new challenges in learning, ranging from scalability, training efficiency, to model quality.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5. Hyena Hierarchy: Towards Larger Convolutional Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: tensor cores optimized transformer architectures*\n\n*Michael Poli, Stefano Massaroli, Eric Q. Nguyen, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao, S. Baccus, Y. Bengio, Stefano Ermon, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating, and sets a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 212  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Efficient Quantized Sparse Matrix Operations on Tensor Cores\n\n*From Search Query: tensor cores optimized transformer architectures*\n\n*Torsten Hoefler, Kazuki Osawa, Shigang Li*\n\n**Abstract:** The exponentially growing model size drives the continued success of deep learning, but it brings prohibitive computation and memory cost. From the algorithm perspective, model sparsification and quantization have been studied to alleviate the problem. From the architecture perspective, hardware vendors provide Tensor cores for acceleration. However, it is very challenging to gain practical speedups from sparse, low-precision matrix operations on Tensor cores, because of the strict requirements for data layout and lack of support for efficiently manipulating the low-precision integers. We propose Magicube, a high-performance sparse-matrix library for low-precision integers on Tensor cores. Magicube supports SpMM and SDDMM, two major sparse operations in deep learning with mixed precision. Experimental results on an NVIDIA A100 GPU show that Magicube achieves on average 1.44x (up to 2.37x) speedup over the vendor-optimized library for sparse kernels, and 1.43x speedup over the state-of-the-art with a comparable accuracy for end-to-end sparse Transformer inference.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-14\n\n\n\n#### 2. OliVe: Accelerating Large Language Models via Hardware-friendly Outlier-Victim Pair Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: tensor cores optimized transformer architectures*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success with the growing model size. LLMs' size grows by $240\\times$ every two years, which outpaces the hardware progress and makes model inference increasingly costly. Model quantization is a promising approach to mitigate the widening gap between LLM size and hardware capacity. However, the existence of outliers, values with significant magnitudes, in LLMs makes existing quantization methods less effective. Prior outlier-aware quantization schemes adopt sparsity encoding techniques to separate outliers from normal values where the process requires global coordination (e.g., a global sparsity coordination list). This incurs complex encoding/decoding hardware logics and an extra orchestration controller for the computation between outlier and normal values. As such, it is not hardware-efficient and hence only achieves sub-optimal quantization benefits. We propose OliVe, an algorithm/architecture co-designed solution that adopts an outlier-victim pair (OVP) quantization and handles outlier values locally with low hardware overheads and high performance gains. The key insight of OliVe is that outliers are important while the normal values next to them are not. Thus those normal values (called victims) can be sacrificed to accommodate outliers. This enables a memory-aligned OVP encoding scheme, which can be efficiently integrated to the existing hardware accelerators like systolic array and tensor core. As a result, OliVe-based accelerator surpasses the existing outlier-aware accelerator, GOBO, by 4.5$\\times$ speedup and 4.0$\\times$ energy reduction, respectively, with a superior model accuracy.\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher is aiming to develop a novel autoregressive language model block, termed **HierarchicalGeometricGPT**, which integrates **HierarchicalRMSNorm** and **GeometricGatedMHA** to enhance efficiency, expressiveness, and scalability.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Novelty of Integration**: While hierarchical normalization and geometric attention mechanisms have been individually explored, the specific combination proposed in **HierarchicalGeometricGPT**\u2014integrating **HierarchicalRMSNorm** with **GeometricGatedMHA**\u2014appears to be novel. Existing integrations, such as those in **Griffin** and **Generalist Equivariant Transformer**, focus on particular domains or aspects but do not amalgamate hierarchical normalization with geometric awareness in the context of autoregressive language models.\n\n- **Feasibility of Tensor Optimization**: The referenced works, particularly **FlashFFTConv** and **Linear-Time Transformers via Vector Quantization**, demonstrate the viability of tensor-optimized operations to enhance transformer efficiency. These techniques can be adapted to support the tensor-optimized hierarchical processing envisioned in the proposal.\n\n- **Unified Memory Management**: Systems like **DeepSpeed Ulysses** and frameworks like **UniMem** highlight effective memory management strategies for handling long sequences and multi-scale processing. These insights are directly relevant to the proposal's emphasis on unified memory management to support hierarchical and geometric computations.\n\n- **Geometric-Aware Normalization**: The **Generalist Equivariant Transformer** showcases the effectiveness of integrating geometric transformations with hierarchical structures, albeit in the domain of 3D molecular interactions. Extending such integrations to language models could potentially capture complex multi-scale feature relationships, enhancing model expressiveness.\n\n- **Scalability and Efficiency**: Models like **NASViT** and **Zipformer** exemplify successful efforts to optimize transformer architectures for scalability and efficiency without compromising performance. This aligns with the proposal's objectives to maintain computational efficiency while improving feature representation.\n\n- **Normalization Techniques**: Incorporating normalized attention, as explored in **Normalized Attention Without Probability Cage**, suggests alternative approaches to traditional softmax-based attention mechanisms. This can inspire strategies to integrate geometric priors into hierarchical normalization effectively.\n\n- **Potential Challenges**:\n  - **Implementation Complexity**: Merging hierarchical normalization with geometric attention requires careful coordination of different layers and mechanisms, which may introduce challenges in maintaining gradient flow and ensuring stable training.\n  - **Hardware Utilization**: Ensuring that tensor-optimized operations and unified memory management are efficiently mapped to existing hardware architectures necessitates in-depth system-level optimizations.\n  - **Causal Structure Preservation**: Maintaining causality across hierarchical and geometric computations is crucial for autoregressive models, requiring meticulous architectural design.\n\n#### 4. Future Search Plan\n\nTo comprehensively assess **HierarchicalGeometricGPT** and ensure a robust review, the following search directions are proposed:\n\n**Round 3 Searches:**\n\n- **External Source Searches:**\n  ```keywords hierarchical normalization geometric attention integration```\n  ```keywords tensor cores optimized transformer architectures```\n  ```keywords unified memory management hierarchical transformers```\n\n- **Internal Library Search:**\n  ```description Advanced studies on integrating hierarchical normalization with geometric attention mechanisms in transformer architectures, focusing on tensor-optimized operations and unified memory management to enhance efficiency and scalability in large-scale language models.```\n\n**Objective:**  \nTo locate studies and implementations that explicitly combine hierarchical normalization with geometric attention within transformer architectures, explore tensor core optimizations specific to transformers, and investigate unified memory management strategies that support multi-scale processing in large language models. This will help in verifying the novelty of the proposal and identifying best practices and potential pitfalls.\n\n#### 5.

By refining search queries to target the integration of these two aspects specifically within transformer architectures, the aim is to ascertain the proposal's novelty and identify any existing methodologies that may influence or parallel the proposed design.\n\nThe identified references suggest that while components like hierarchical attention, gated mechanisms, and optimized tensor operations have been individually validated, their synergistic integration within autoregressive language models remains largely untapped. This gap presents a promising avenue for innovation, provided that the proposal effectively amalgamates these elements without introducing prohibitive complexity or impractical implementation challenges.\n\nBy targeting tensor core optimizations and unified memory management in subsequent searches, the analysis can further assess whether the proposed methodologies have feasible pathways based on current technological advancements and research trends. This structured approach ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the proposal's strengths, potential weaknesses, and overall feasibility within the landscape of existing language model architectures.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n1. **Griffin: Mixing Gated Linear Recurrences with Local Attention for Efficient Language Models**  \n   Soham De, Samuel L Smith, et al.

    "abstract": "We propose HierarchicalGeometricGPT, a novel language model block design that efficiently combines hierarchical normalization with geometric attention patterns. The design leverages tensor-optimized matrix operations and unified memory management to create a more efficient and expressive architecture. By integrating Parent 1's HierarchicalRMSNorm with Parent 2's GeometricGatedMHA through a carefully designed tensor-based implementation, our model achieves better feature representation while maintaining computational efficiency. The architecture employs adaptive compression and geometric routing to enable efficient cross-scale information flow while preserving causal structure.",
