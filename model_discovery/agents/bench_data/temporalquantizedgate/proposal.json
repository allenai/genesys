However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.21060, 2024.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/46 (Score: 0.60)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32, 2019 .

Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context Language Modeling (Avg.

Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample implementation of Samba is publicly available in https://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/28 (Score: 0.52)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv: $2307.08691,2023$. $\\left[\\mathrm{DDH}^{+}\\right.$22] Damai Dai, Li Dong, Yaru Hao, Zhifang Sui, Baobao Chang, and Furu Wei.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.43)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 0.37)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

Adaptive Estimators Show Information Compression in Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression neural networks*\n\n*Ivan Chelombiev, Conor J. Houghton, Cian O\u2019Donnell*\n\n**TL;DR:** More robust mutual information estimation techniques are developed, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions, which explore compression in networks with a range of different activation functions.\n\n**Abstract:** To improve how neural networks function it is crucial to understand their learning process. The information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes that neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their representations to disregard information that is not relevant to the task. However, empirical evidence for this theory is conflicting, as compression was only observed when networks used saturating activation functions. In contrast, networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of task performance but did not show compression. In this paper we developed more robust mutual information estimation techniques, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions. Using these adaptive estimation techniques, we explored compression in networks with a range of different activation functions. With two improved methods of estimation, firstly, we show that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression, and the amount of compression varies between different activation functions. We also find that there is a large amount of variation in compression between different network initializations. Secondary, we see that L2 regularization leads to significantly increased compression, while preventing overfitting. Finally, we show that only compression of the last layer is positively correlated with generalization.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 2.

The mainstream approaches for runtime acceleration consist in pruning connections (unstructured pruning) or, better, filters (structured pruning), both often requiring data to re-train the model. In this paper, we present RED, a data-free structured, unified approach to tackle structured pruning. First, we propose a novel adaptive hashing of the scalar DNN weight distribution densities to increase the number of identical neurons represented by their weight vectors. Second, we prune the network by merging redundant neurons based on their relative similarities, as defined by their distance. Third, we propose a novel uneven depthwise separation technique to further prune convolutional layers. We demonstrate through a large variety of benchmarks that RED largely outperforms other data-free pruning methods, often reaching performance similar to unconstrained, data-driven methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

SpikeLM: Towards General Spike-Driven Language Modeling via Elastic Bi-Spiking Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: event-driven gating mechanisms*\n\n*Xingrun Xing, Zheng Zhang, Ziyi Ni, Shitao Xiao, Yiming Ju, Siqi Fan, Yequan Wang, Jiajun Zhang, Guoqi Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the first fully spiking mechanism for general language tasks, including both discriminative and generative ones, and plugs this elastic bi-spiking mechanism in language modeling, named SpikeLM, which achieves much higher accuracy than previously possible.\n\n**Abstract:** Towards energy-efficient artificial intelligence similar to the human brain, the bio-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have advantages of biological plausibility, event-driven sparsity, and binary activation. Recently, large-scale language models exhibit promising generalization capability, making it a valuable issue to explore more general spike-driven models. However, the binary spikes in existing SNNs fail to encode adequate semantic information, placing technological challenges for generalization. This work proposes the first fully spiking mechanism for general language tasks, including both discriminative and generative ones. Different from previous spikes with {0,1} levels, we propose a more general spike formulation with bi-directional, elastic amplitude, and elastic frequency encoding, while still maintaining the addition nature of SNNs. In a single time step, the spike is enhanced by direction and amplitude information; in spike frequency, a strategy to control spike firing rate is well designed. We plug this elastic bi-spiking mechanism in language modeling, named SpikeLM. It is the first time to handle general language tasks with fully spike-driven models, which achieve much higher accuracy than previously possible. SpikeLM also greatly bridges the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs in language modeling.

Collective Event Detection via a Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: event-driven gating mechanisms*\n\n*Yubo Chen, Hang Yang, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao, Yantao Jia*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively and a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information to solve the two problems simultaneously.\n\n**Abstract:** Traditional approaches to the task of ACE event detection primarily regard multiple events in one sentence as independent ones and recognize them separately by using sentence-level information. However, events in one sentence are usually interdependent and sentence-level information is often insufficient to resolve ambiguities for some types of events. This paper proposes a novel framework dubbed as Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms (HBTNGMA) to solve the two problems simultaneously. Firstly, we propose a hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively. Then, we devise a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information. The experimental results on the widely used ACE 2005 dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 102  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 7.

Existing methods either search for neural architectures in heuristic design spaces or apply low-level adjustments to computation primitives to improve inference efficiency on hardware. We present Automated Graph Optimization (AutoGO), a framework to evolve neural networks in a low-level Computation Graph (CG) of primitive operations to improve both its performance and hardware friendliness. Through a tokenization scheme, AutoGO performs variable-sized segment mutations, making both primitive changes and larger-grained changes to CGs. We introduce our segmentation and mutation algorithms, efficient frequent segment mining technique, as well as a pretrained context-aware predictor to estimate the impact of segment replacements. Extensive experimental results show that AutoGO can automatically evolve several typical large convolutional networks to achieve significant task performance improvement and FLOPs reduction on a range of CV tasks, ranging from Classification, Semantic Segmentation, Human Pose Estimation, to Super Resolution, yet without introducing any newer primitive operations. We also demonstrate the lightweight deployment results of AutoGO-optimized super-resolution and denoising U-Nets on a cycle simulator for a Neural Processing Unit (NPU), achieving PSNR improvement and latency/power reduction simultaneously.

Thanks to the strong representation power of graph neural network (GNN), a variety of GNN-based inexact methods emerged. To capture the subtle difference across graphs, the key success is designing the dense interaction with features fusion at the early stage, which, however, is a trade-off between speed and accuracy. For Slow Learning of graph similarity, this paper proposes a novel early-fusion approach by designing a co-attention-based feature fusion network on multilevel GNN features. To further improve the speed without much accuracy drop, we introduce an ef\ufb01cient GSC solution by distilling the knowledge from the slow early-fusion model to the student one for Fast Inference . Such a student model also enables the of\ufb02ine collection of individual graph embeddings, speeding up the inference time in orders . To address the instability through knowledge transfer, we decompose the dynamic joint embedding into the static pseudo individual ones for precise teacher-student alignment. The experimental analysis on the real-world datasets demonstrates the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods on both accuracy and ef\ufb01ciency. Particularly, we speed up the prior art by more than 10x on the benchmark AIDS data.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 9. Efficient Graph Similarity Computation with Alignment Regularization\n\n*From Search Query: selective graph computation*\n\n*Wei Zhuo, Guang Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that the expensive node-to-node matching module is not necessary for GSC, and high-quality learning can be attained with a simple yet powerful regularization technique, which is called the Alignment Regularization (AReg).\n\n**Abstract:** We consider the graph similarity computation (GSC) task based on graph edit distance (GED) estimation. State-of-the-art methods treat GSC as a learning-based prediction task using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To capture fine-grained interactions between pair-wise graphs, these methods mostly contain a node-level matching module in the end-to-end learning pipeline, which causes high computational costs in both the training and inference stages. We show that the expensive node-to-node matching module is not necessary for GSC, and high-quality learning can be attained with a simple yet powerful regularization technique, which we call the Alignment Regularization (AReg). In the training stage, the AReg term imposes a node-graph correspondence constraint on the GNN encoder. In the inference stage, the graph-level representations learned by the GNN encoder are directly used to compute the similarity score without using AReg again to speed up inference. We further propose a multi-scale GED discriminator to enhance the expressive ability of the learned representations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and transferability of our approach.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Context-adaptive neural network based prediction for image compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression neural networks*\n\n*Thierry Dumas, Aline Roumy, Christine Guillemot*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper describes a set of neural network architectures, called Prediction Neural Networks Set (PNNS), based on both fully-connected and convolutional neural networks, for intra image prediction. The choice of neural network for predicting a given image block depends on the block size, hence does not need to be signalled to the decoder. It is shown that, while fully-connected neural networks give good performance for small block sizes, convolutional neural networks provide better predictions in large blocks with complex textures. Thanks to the use of masks of random sizes during training, the neural networks of PNNS well adapt to the available context that may vary, depending on the position of the image block to be predicted. When integrating PNNS into a H.265 codec, PSNR-rate performance gains going from 1.46% to 5.20% are obtained. These gains are on average 0.99% larger than those of prior neural network based methods. Unlike the H.265 intra prediction modes, which are each specialized in predicting a specific texture, the proposed PNNS can model a large set of complex textures.\n\n**Published:** 2018-07-17\n\n\n\n#### 2. Accelerating Deep Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Transfer Channel Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression neural networks*\n\n*Jindong Wang, Chaohui Yu, Zijing Wu, Yiqiang Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has recently received increasing\nattention from researchers. However, existing methods are computationally\nintensive due to the computation cost of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\nadopted by most work. To date, there is no effective network compression method\nfor accelerating these models. In this paper, we propose a unified Transfer\nChannel Pruning (TCP) approach for accelerating UDA models. TCP is capable of\ncompressing the deep UDA model by pruning less important channels while\nsimultaneously learning transferable features by reducing the cross-domain\ndistribution divergence. Therefore, it reduces the impact of negative transfer\nand maintains competitive performance on the target task. To the best of our\nknowledge, TCP is the first approach that aims at accelerating deep UDA models.\nTCP is validated on two benchmark datasets-Office-31 and ImageCLEF-DA with two\ncommon backbone networks-VGG16 and ResNet50. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat TCP achieves comparable or better classification accuracy than other\ncomparison methods while significantly reducing the computational cost. To be\nmore specific, in VGG16, we get even higher accuracy after pruning 26% floating\npoint operations (FLOPs); in ResNet50, we also get higher accuracy on half of\nthe tasks after pruning 12% FLOPs. We hope that TCP will open a new door for\nfuture research on accelerating transfer learning models.\n\n**Published:** 2019-03-25\n\n\n\n#### 3. Gated Attention Coding for Training High-performance and Efficient Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: event-driven gating mechanisms*\n\n*Guoqi Li, Liang-Jian Deng, Zhaorui Wang, Yuhong Chou, Rui-Jie Zhu, Xuerui Qiu*\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are emerging as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) due to their unique spike-based event-driven nature. Coding is crucial in SNNs as it converts external input stimuli into spatio-temporal feature sequences. However, most existing deep SNNs rely on direct coding that generates powerless spike representation and lacks the temporal dynamics inherent in human vision. Hence, we introduce Gated Attention Coding (GAC), a plug-and-play module that leverages the multi-dimensional gated attention unit to efficiently encode inputs into powerful representations before feeding them into the SNN architecture. GAC functions as a preprocessing layer that does not disrupt the spike-driven nature of the SNN, making it amenable to efficient neuromorphic hardware implementation with minimal modifications. Through an observer model theoretical analysis, we demonstrate GAC's attention mechanism improves temporal dynamics and coding efficiency. Experiments on CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that GAC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with remarkable efficiency. Notably, we improve top-1 accuracy by 3.10\\% on CIFAR100 with only 6-time steps and 1.07\\% on ImageNet while reducing energy usage to 66.9\\% of the previous works. To our best knowledge, it is the first time to explore the attention-based dynamic coding scheme in deep SNNs, with exceptional effectiveness and efficiency on large-scale datasets.The Code is available at https://github.com/bollossom/GAC.\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-12\n\n\n\n#### 4. Mamba-Spike: Enhancing the Mamba Architecture with a Spiking Front-End for Efficient Temporal Data Processing\n\n*From Search Query: event-driven gating mechanisms*\n\n*Feng Liu, Jiahao Qin*\n\n**Abstract:** The field of neuromorphic computing has gained significant attention in recent years, aiming to bridge the gap between the efficiency of biological neural networks and the performance of artificial intelligence systems. This paper introduces Mamba-Spike, a novel neuromorphic architecture that integrates a spiking front-end with the Mamba backbone to achieve efficient and robust temporal data processing. The proposed approach leverages the event-driven nature of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to capture and process asynchronous, time-varying inputs, while harnessing the power of the Mamba backbone's selective state spaces and linear-time sequence modeling capabilities to model complex temporal dependencies effectively. The spiking front-end of Mamba-Spike employs biologically inspired neuron models, along with adaptive threshold and synaptic dynamics. These components enable efficient spatiotemporal feature extraction and encoding of the input data. The Mamba backbone, on the other hand, utilizes a hierarchical structure with gated recurrent units and attention mechanisms to capture long-term dependencies and selectively process relevant information. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed architecture, a comprehensive empirical study is conducted on both neuromorphic datasets, including DVS Gesture and TIDIGITS, and standard datasets, such as Sequential MNIST and CIFAR10-DVS. The results demonstrate that Mamba-Spike consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher accuracy, lower latency, and improved energy efficiency. Moreover, the model exhibits robustness to various input perturbations and noise levels, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.

Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Parameter Sharing\n\n*From Search Query: selective graph computation*\n\n*Melody Y. Guan, Quoc V. Le, Barret Zoph, Jeff Dean, Hieu Pham*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS), a fast and\ninexpensive approach for automatic model design. In ENAS, a controller learns\nto discover neural network architectures by searching for an optimal subgraph\nwithin a large computational graph. The controller is trained with policy\ngradient to select a subgraph that maximizes the expected reward on the\nvalidation set. Meanwhile the model corresponding to the selected subgraph is\ntrained to minimize a canonical cross entropy loss. Thanks to parameter sharing\nbetween child models, ENAS is fast: it delivers strong empirical performances\nusing much fewer GPU-hours than all existing automatic model design approaches,\nand notably, 1000x less expensive than standard Neural Architecture Search. On\nthe Penn Treebank dataset, ENAS discovers a novel architecture that achieves a\ntest perplexity of 55.8, establishing a new state-of-the-art among all methods\nwithout post-training processing. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, ENAS designs novel\narchitectures that achieve a test error of 2.89%, which is on par with NASNet\n(Zoph et al., 2018), whose test error is 2.65%.\n\n**Published:** 2018-02-09\n\n\n\n#### 6. Towards Automated Circuit Discovery for Mechanistic Interpretability\n\n*From Search Query: selective graph computation*\n\n*Adri\u00e0 Garriga-Alonso, Stefan Heimersheim, Aengus Lynch, Augustine N. Mavor-Parker, Arthur Conmy*\n\n**Abstract:** Through considerable effort and intuition, several recent works have reverse-engineered nontrivial behaviors of transformer models. This paper systematizes the mechanistic interpretability process they followed. First, researchers choose a metric and dataset that elicit the desired model behavior. Then, they apply activation patching to find which abstract neural network units are involved in the behavior. By varying the dataset, metric, and units under investigation, researchers can understand the functionality of each component. We automate one of the process' steps: to identify the circuit that implements the specified behavior in the model's computational graph. We propose several algorithms and reproduce previous interpretability results to validate them. For example, the ACDC algorithm rediscovered 5/5 of the component types in a circuit in GPT-2 Small that computes the Greater-Than operation. ACDC selected 68 of the 32,000 edges in GPT-2 Small, all of which were manually found by previous work. Our code is available at https://github.com/ArthurConmy/Automatic-Circuit-Discovery.\n\n**Conference:** towards-automated-circuit-discovery-for\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using the specified keywords and details, here are some key points and references that can guide the research:\n\n### Techniques for Combining Gating Mechanisms with Vector Quantization\n\n- The integration of gating mechanisms with vector quantization can be seen in the context of adaptive compression. For instance, the \"EventVQ\" parent design mentioned in the analysis uses event-driven selective computation and vector quantization. Combining this with gating mechanisms, as in \"GatedTTTLinear,\" could involve using the gating mechanisms to dynamically adjust the compression ratios based on the importance of the input data. This approach is hinted at in the excerpt from \"Adaptive Compression for Language Models\" by Chen et al., which discusses dynamic compression ratios based on content importance.\n\n### Methods for Efficient Event Detection in Neural Networks\n\n- Event-driven neural networks, as surveyed by Liu et al., offer insights into how event detection can reduce computational operations while maintaining accuracy. This method involves triggering computations only when significant events occur, which can be particularly useful in reducing the overhead of graph operations and other computationally intensive tasks. The survey highlights that event-driven computation can reduce operations by 40-60% compared to dense processing.\n\n### Adaptive Compression Strategies for Language Models\n\n- The work by Chen et al. on \"Adaptive Compression for Language Models\" is directly relevant here. It discusses how dynamic compression ratios based on content importance can significantly reduce memory usage (up to 70%) while maintaining model quality. This adaptive approach can be integrated with the gating mechanisms and event detection to optimize compression levels based on the importance of different parts of the input data.\n\n### Integration of Graph Operations with Selective Computation\n\n- The paper by Wang et al. on \"Graph Neural Networks with Adaptive Computation\" provides a framework for selective graph operations based on node importance. This can help reduce computational complexity while preserving global dependency modeling. Integrating this with event-driven selective computation can further optimize the computational efficiency of the model.\n\n### Memory-Efficient State Management in Language Models\n\n- For memory-efficient state management, hierarchical compression for states, event-driven cache updates, and importance-based memory allocation are key strategies. The adaptive compression techniques discussed by Chen et al. can be extended to include hierarchical compression, where different levels of compression are applied based on the importance of the states. Event-driven cache updates can ensure that the most relevant information is readily available, reducing memory access overhead.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Combining Gating and Quantization**: The concept of using gating mechanisms to guide vector quantization decisions can be further explored by integrating the principles from Bayesian model selection, as discussed in the paper on \"Efficient Model Compression for Bayesian Neural Networks.\" This involves using posterior inclusion probabilities to prune parameters, which can be adapted to guide quantization decisions.\n\n- **Efficient Implementations**: The use of event detection to guide both gating and quantization decisions, as well as selective graph operations, can be optimized by leveraging recent advances in adaptive compression techniques and efficient implementations of selective computation. This can involve techniques such as those described in the survey on event-driven neural networks and the work on graph neural networks with adaptive computation.\n\nBy combining these insights, the researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that leverages adaptive compression, event-driven computation, and selective graph operations to achieve low perplexity, high accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and good scalability.\n",

R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2019)\t**Cited by** 84  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms, and can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations.\n\n**Abstract:** Fast linear transforms are ubiquitous in machine learning, including the discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and other structured transformations such as convolutions. All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/35 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 190-196, 1999.

Our approach reduces the number of parameters of the network by more than 50% and speeds up the inference time by around 1.35x compared to the baseline transformer model. The experiments show that our LRT model generalizes better and yields lower error rates on both validation and test sets compared to an uncompressed transformer model. The LRT model outperforms those from existing works on several datasets in an end-to-end setting without using an external language model or acoustic data.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nIEEE, 2019, pp. 7095-7099.

SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Rui Zhu, Qihang Zhao, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 54  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper successfully implements `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units, and is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language.\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations.

Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/32 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 7275-7286, Dublin, Ireland, may 2022.

SAPE: Spatially-Adaptive Progressive Encoding for Neural Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive neural networks*\n\n*Amir Hertz, Or Perel, R. Giryes, O. Sorkine-Hornung, D. Cohen-Or*\n\n**TL;DR:** A spatially adaptive progressive encoding scheme for input signals of MLP networks is presented, which enables them to better fit a wide range of frequencies without sacrificing training stability or requiring any domain specific preprocessing.\n\n**Abstract:** Multilayer-perceptrons (MLP) are known to struggle with learning functions of high-frequencies, and in particular cases with wide frequency bands. We present a spatially adaptive progressive encoding (SAPE) scheme for input signals of MLP networks, which enables them to better fit a wide range of frequencies without sacrificing training stability or requiring any domain specific preprocessing. SAPE gradually unmasks signal components with increasing frequencies as a function of time and space. The progressive exposure of frequencies is monitored by a feedback loop throughout the neural optimization process, allowing changes to propagate at different rates among local spatial portions of the signal space. We demonstrate the advantage of SAPE on a variety of domains and applications, including regression of low dimensional signals and images, representation learning of occupancy networks, and a geometric task of mesh transfer between 3D shapes.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 60  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 2. Robustifying Generalizable Implicit Shape Networks with a Tunable Non-Parametric Model\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive neural networks*\n\n*Amine Ouasfi, A. Boukhayma*\n\n**TL;DR:** A efficient mechanism to remedy generalization issues in forward generalizable models for implicit shape reconstruction from unoriented point cloud by combining the inter-shape data prior of the network with an intra-shape regularization prior of a Nystr\\\"om Kernel Ridge Regression.\n\n**Abstract:** Feedforward generalizable models for implicit shape reconstruction from unoriented point cloud present multiple advantages, including high performance and inference speed. However, they still suffer from generalization issues, ranging from underfitting the input point cloud, to misrepresenting samples outside of the training data distribution, or with toplogies unseen at training. We propose here an efficient mechanism to remedy some of these limitations at test time. We combine the inter-shape data prior of the network with an intra-shape regularization prior of a Nystr\\\"om Kernel Ridge Regression, that we further adapt by fitting its hyperprameters to the current shape. The resulting shape function defined in a shape specific Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space benefits from desirable stability and efficiency properties and grants a shape adaptive expressiveness-robustness trade-off. We demonstrate the improvement obtained through our method with respect to baselines and the state-of-the-art using synthetic and real data.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. How Do Adam and Training Strategies Help BNNs Optimization?\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive neural networks*\n\n*Zechun Liu, Zhiqiang Shen, Shichao Li, Koen Helwegen, Dong Huang, Kwang-Ting Cheng*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper derives a simple training scheme, building on existing Adam-based optimization, which achieves 70.5% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet dataset using the same architecture as the state-of theart ReActNet while achieving 1.1% higher accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** The best performing Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) are usually attained using Adam optimization and its multi-step training variants. However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies explore the fundamental reasons why Adam is superior to other optimizers like SGD for BNN optimization or provide analytical explanations that support specific training strategies. To address this, in this paper we first investigate the trajectories of gradients and weights in BNNs during the training process. We show the regularization effect of second-order momentum in Adam is crucial to revitalize the weights that are dead due to the activation saturation in BNNs. We find that Adam, through its adaptive learning rate strategy, is better equipped to handle the rugged loss surface of BNNs and reaches a better optimum with higher generalization ability. Furthermore, we inspect the intriguing role of the real-valued weights in binary networks, and reveal the effect of weight decay on the stability and sluggishness of BNN optimization. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we derive a simple training scheme, building on existing Adam-based optimization, which achieves 70.5% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet dataset using the same architecture as the state-of-the-art ReActNet while achieving 1.1% higher accuracy.

HRKD: Hierarchical Relational Knowledge Distillation for Cross-domain Language Model Compression\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression language models*\n\n*Chenhe Dong, Yaliang Li, Ying Shen, Minghui Qiu*\n\n**TL;DR:** To enhance the model capability and transferability, the idea of meta-learning is leveraged and set up domain-relational graphs to capture the relational information across different domains, and to dynamically select the most representative prototypes for each domain, a hierarchical compare-aggregate mechanism to capture hierarchical relationships.\n\n**Abstract:** On many natural language processing tasks, large pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown overwhelming performances compared with traditional neural network methods. Nevertheless, their huge model size and low inference speed have hindered the deployment on resource-limited devices in practice. In this paper, we target to compress PLMs with knowledge distillation, and propose a hierarchical relational knowledge distillation (HRKD) method to capture both hierarchical and domain relational information. Specifically, to enhance the model capability and transferability, we leverage the idea of meta-learning and set up domain-relational graphs to capture the relational information across different domains. And to dynamically select the most representative prototypes for each domain, we propose a hierarchical compare-aggregate mechanism to capture hierarchical relationships. Extensive experiments on public multi-domain datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our HRKD method as well as its strong few-shot learning ability.

The algorithm first utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to propose an initial segmentation of the trajectories. Following that, a hierarchical variational inference framework incorporates the LLM-generated segmentation information to discover reusable skills by merging trajectory segments. To further control the trade-off between compression and reusability, we introduce a novel auxiliary objective based on the Minimum Description Length principle that helps guide this skill discovery process. Our results demonstrate that agents equipped with our method are able to discover skills that help accelerate learning and outperform baseline skill learning approaches on new long-horizon tasks in BabyAI, a grid world navigation environment, as well as ALFRED, a household simulation environment.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. LoSparse: Structured Compression of Large Language Models based on Low-Rank and Sparse Approximation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression language models*\n\n*Yixiao Li, Yifan Yu, Qingru Zhang, Chen Liang, Pengcheng He, Weizhu Chen, Tuo Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** LoSparse (Low-Rank and Sparse approximation), a novel model compression technique that approximates a weight matrix by the sum of a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix, which significantly outperforms existing compression methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models have achieved remarkable results in various natural language tasks, but they are often prohibitively large, requiring massive memories and computational resources. To reduce the size and complexity of these models, we propose LoSparse (Low-Rank and Sparse approximation), a novel model compression technique that approximates a weight matrix by the sum of a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix. Our method combines the advantages of both low-rank approximations and pruning, while avoiding their limitations. Low-rank approximation compresses the coherent and expressive parts in neurons, while pruning removes the incoherent and non-expressive parts in neurons. Pruning enhances the diversity of low-rank approximations, and low-rank approximation prevents pruning from losing too many expressive neurons. We evaluate our method on natural language understanding, question answering, and natural language generation tasks. We show that it significantly outperforms existing compression methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 43  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 7. SparseProp: Efficient Event-Based Simulation and Training of Sparse Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient event detection neural networks*\n\n*Rainer Engelken*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work provides an efficient and exact solution for training large-scale spiking neural networks and opens up new possibilities for building more sophisticated brain-inspired models.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are biologically-inspired models that are capable of processing information in streams of action potentials. However, simulating and training SNNs is computationally expensive due to the need to solve large systems of coupled differential equations. In this paper, we introduce SparseProp, a novel event-based algorithm for simulating and training sparse SNNs. Our algorithm reduces the computational cost of both the forward and backward pass operations from O(N) to O(log(N)) per network spike, thereby enabling numerically exact simulations of large spiking networks and their efficient training using backpropagation through time. By leveraging the sparsity of the network, SparseProp eliminates the need to iterate through all neurons at each spike, employing efficient state updates instead. We demonstrate the efficacy of SparseProp across several classical integrate-and-fire neuron models, including a simulation of a sparse SNN with one million LIF neurons. This results in a speed-up exceeding four orders of magnitude relative to previous event-based implementations. Our work provides an efficient and exact solution for training large-scale spiking neural networks and opens up new possibilities for building more sophisticated brain-inspired models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Energy-based Out-of-Distribution Detection for Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient event detection neural networks*\n\n*Qitian Wu, Yiting Chen, Chenxiao Yang, Junchi Yan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the under-explored problem, OOD detection on graph-structured data, and identifies a provably effective OOD discriminator based on an energy function directly extracted from graph neural networks trained with standard classification loss, which paves a way for a simple, powerful and efficient Ood detection model for GNN-based learning on graphs, which is called GNNSafe.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning on graphs, where instance nodes are inter-connected, has become one of the central problems for deep learning, as relational structures are pervasive and induce data inter-dependence which hinders trivial adaptation of existing approaches that assume inputs to be i.i.d.~sampled. However, current models mostly focus on improving testing performance of in-distribution data and largely ignore the potential risk w.r.t. out-of-distribution (OOD) testing samples that may cause negative outcome if the prediction is overconfident on them. In this paper, we investigate the under-explored problem, OOD detection on graph-structured data, and identify a provably effective OOD discriminator based on an energy function directly extracted from graph neural networks trained with standard classification loss. This paves a way for a simple, powerful and efficient OOD detection model for GNN-based learning on graphs, which we call GNNSafe. It also has nice theoretical properties that guarantee an overall distinguishable margin between the detection scores for in-distribution and OOD samples, which, more critically, can be further strengthened by a learning-free energy belief propagation scheme. For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce new benchmark settings that evaluate the model for detecting OOD data from both synthetic and real distribution shifts (cross-domain graph shifts and temporal graph shifts). The results show that GNNSafe achieves up to $17.0\\%$ AUROC improvement over state-of-the-arts and it could serve as simple yet strong baselines in such an under-developed area.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 39  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 9. Event Detection: Gate Diversity and Syntactic Importance Scores for Graph Convolution Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient event detection neural networks*\n\n*Viet Dac Lai, Tuan Ngo Nguyen, Thien Huu Nguyen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study proposes a novel gating mechanism to filter noisy information in the hidden vectors of the GCN models for ED based on the information from the trigger candidate and introduces novel mechanisms to achieve the contextual diversity for the gates and the importance score consistency for the graphs and models in ED.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent studies on event detection (ED) have shown that the syntactic dependency graph can be employed in graph convolution neural networks (GCN) to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, the computation of the hidden vectors in such graph-based models is agnostic to the trigger candidate words, potentially leaving irrelevant information for the trigger candidate for event prediction. In addition, the current models for ED fail to exploit the overall contextual importance scores of the words, which can be obtained via the dependency tree, to boost the performance. In this study, we propose a novel gating mechanism to filter noisy information in the hidden vectors of the GCN models for ED based on the information from the trigger candidate. We also introduce novel mechanisms to achieve the contextual diversity for the gates and the importance score consistency for the graphs and models in ED. The experiments show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two ED datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 89  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. AdaBelief Optimizer: Adapting Stepsizes by the Belief in Observed Gradients\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive neural networks*\n\n*James S. Duncan, Xenophon Papademetris, Yifan Ding, Nicha Dvornek, Sekhar Tatikonda, Tommy Tang, Juntang Zhuang*\n\n**Abstract:** Most popular optimizers for deep learning can be broadly categorized as adaptive methods (e.g. Adam) and accelerated schemes (e.g. stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum). For many models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), adaptive methods typically converge faster but generalize worse compared to SGD; for complex settings such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), adaptive methods are typically the default because of their stability.We propose AdaBelief to simultaneously achieve three goals: fast convergence as in adaptive methods, good generalization as in SGD, and training stability. The intuition for AdaBelief is to adapt the stepsize according to the \"belief\" in the current gradient direction. Viewing the exponential moving average (EMA) of the noisy gradient as the prediction of the gradient at the next time step, if the observed gradient greatly deviates from the prediction, we distrust the current observation and take a small step; if the observed gradient is close to the prediction, we trust it and take a large step. We validate AdaBelief in extensive experiments, showing that it outperforms other methods with fast convergence and high accuracy on image classification and language modeling. Specifically, on ImageNet, AdaBelief achieves comparable accuracy to SGD. Furthermore, in the training of a GAN on Cifar10, AdaBelief demonstrates high stability and improves the quality of generated samples compared to a well-tuned Adam optimizer.

Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive neural networks*\n\n*Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, Geoffrey E. Hinton*\n\n**Abstract:** Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive.\nOne way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the\nneurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the\ndistribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training\ncases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the\nsummed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces\nthe training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch\nnormalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to\napply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch\nnormalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used\nfor normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a\nsingle training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its\nown adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before\nthe non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs\nexactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also\nstraightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the\nnormalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is\nvery effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks.\nEmpirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the\ntraining time compared with previously published techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2016-07-21\n\n\n\n#### 3.

We introduce MusicGen, a single Language Model (LM) that operates over several streams of compressed discrete music representation, i.e., tokens. Unlike prior work, MusicGen is comprised of a single-stage transformer LM together with efficient token interleaving patterns, which eliminates the need for cascading several models, e.g., hierarchically or upsampling. Following this approach, we demonstrate how MusicGen can generate high-quality samples, both mono and stereo, while being conditioned on textual description or melodic features, allowing better controls over the generated output. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation, considering both automatic and human studies, showing the proposed approach is superior to the evaluated baselines on a standard text-to-music benchmark. Through ablation studies, we shed light over the importance of each of the components comprising MusicGen.

Discrete Autoencoders for Sequence Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression language models*\n\n*\u0141ukasz Kaiser, Samy Bengio*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent models for sequences have been recently successful at many tasks,\nespecially for language modeling and machine translation. Nevertheless, it\nremains challenging to extract good representations from these models. For\ninstance, even though language has a clear hierarchical structure going from\ncharacters through words to sentences, it is not apparent in current language\nmodels. We propose to improve the representation in sequence models by\naugmenting current approaches with an autoencoder that is forced to compress\nthe sequence through an intermediate discrete latent space. In order to\npropagate gradients though this discrete representation we introduce an\nimproved semantic hashing technique. We show that this technique performs well\non a newly proposed quantitative efficiency measure. We also analyze latent\ncodes produced by the model showing how they correspond to words and phrases.\nFinally, we present an application of the autoencoder-augmented model to\ngenerating diverse translations.\n\n**Conference:** discrete-autoencoders-for-sequence-models-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-01-29\n\n\n\n#### 5. Event-based Vision: A Survey\n\n*From Search Query: efficient event detection neural networks*\n\n*Kostas Daniilidis, Guillermo Gallego, Garrick Orchard, Davide Scaramuzza, Tobi Delbruck, Stefan Leutenegger, Joerg Conradt, Chiara Bartolozzi, Brian Taba, Andrew Davison, Andrea Censi*\n\n**Abstract:** Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that differ from conventional frame cameras: Instead of capturing images at a fixed rate, they asynchronously measure per-pixel brightness changes, and output a stream of events that encode the time, location and sign of the brightness changes. Event cameras offer attractive properties compared to traditional cameras: high temporal resolution (in the order of microseconds), very high dynamic range (140 dB vs. 60 dB), low power consumption, and high pixel bandwidth (on the order of kHz) resulting in reduced motion blur. Hence, event cameras have a large potential for robotics and computer vision in challenging scenarios for traditional cameras, such as low-latency, high speed, and high dynamic range. However, novel methods are required to process the unconventional output of these sensors in order to unlock their potential. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of event-based vision, with a focus on the applications and the algorithms developed to unlock the outstanding properties of event cameras. We present event cameras from their working principle, the actual sensors that are available and the tasks that they have been used for, from low-level vision (feature detection and tracking, optic flow, etc.) to high-level vision (reconstruction, segmentation, recognition). We also discuss the techniques developed to process events, including learning-based techniques, as well as specialized processors for these novel sensors, such as spiking neural networks. Additionally, we highlight the challenges that remain to be tackled and the opportunities that lie ahead in the search for a more efficient, bio-inspired way for machines to perceive and interact with the world.\n\n**Published:** 2019-04-17\n\n\n\n#### 6. BirdNET: A deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring\n\n*From Search Query: efficient event detection neural networks*\n\n*Holger Klinck, Maximilian Eibl, Connor M. Wood, Stefan Kahl*\n\n**Abstract:** Variation in avian diversity in space and time is commonly used as a metric to assess environmental changes. Conventionally, such data were collected by expert observers, but passively collected acoustic data is rapidly emerging as an alternative survey technique. However, efficiently extracting accurate species richness data from large audio datasets has proven challenging. Recent advances in deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) have transformed the field of machine learning, frequently outperforming traditional signal processing techniques in the domain of acoustic event detection and classification. We developed a DNN, called BirdNET, capable of identifying 984 North American and European bird species by sound. Our task-specific model architecture was derived from the family of residual networks (ResNets), consisted of 157 layers with more than 27 million parameters, and was trained using extensive data pre-processing, augmentation, and mixup. We tested the model against three independent datasets: (a) 22,960 single-species recordings; (b) 286 h of fully annotated soundscape data collected by an array of autonomous recording units in a design analogous to what researchers might use to measure avian diversity in a field setting; and (c) 33,670 h of soundscape data from a single high-quality omnidirectional microphone deployed near four eBird hotspots frequented by expert birders. We found that domain-specific data augmentation is key to build models that are robust against high ambient noise levels and can cope with overlapping vocalizations. Task-specific model designs and training regimes for audio event recognition perform on-par with very complex architectures used in other domains (e.g., object detection in images). We also found that high temporal resolution of input spectrograms (short FFT window length) improves the classification performance for bird sounds. In summary, BirdNET achieved a mean average precision of 0.791 for single-species recordings, a F0.5 score of 0.414 for annotated soundscapes, and an average correlation of 0.251 with hotspot observation across 121 species and 4 years of audio data. By enabling the efficient extraction of the vocalizations of many hundreds of bird species from potentially vast amounts of audio data, BirdNET and similar tools have the potential to add tremendous value to existing and future passively collected audio datasets and may transform the field of avian ecology and conservation.\n\n**Proceeding:** ecological-informatics-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-01-27\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, especially focusing on training stability, hierarchical compression, efficient event detection, and the integration of adaptive components, here are some key insights and relevant information:\n\n## Methods for Ensuring Training Stability in Adaptive Neural Networks\n\n### Adaptive Learning Rates\nEnsuring training stability in adaptive neural networks can be achieved through dynamic adjustment of the learning rate. Techniques such as adaptive learning rates, decaying learning rates, scheduled drop learning rates, and cycling learning rates can help optimize the convergence speed and stability of the model. These methods adjust the learning rate based on the model's performance and the gradient of the cost function, preventing overshooting or oscillations during training.\n\n### Regularization and Stability Analysis\nThe use of regularization terms and stability analysis can also enhance training stability. For instance, the paper on \"Self-Supervised Meta-Learning for All-Layer DNN-Based Adaptive Control\" introduces a framework that includes regularization coefficients to ensure the model's disturbance prediction capability and minimize the network\u2019s Jacobian norm, thereby enhancing stability during online adaptation.\n\n## Hierarchical Compression Techniques for Language Model States and Activations\n\n### Dynamic Compression Ratios\nHierarchical compression can be achieved by implementing dynamic compression ratios based on content importance. This approach can reduce memory usage significantly while maintaining model quality. For example, the work on \"Adaptive Compression for Language Models\" suggests that dynamic compression ratios can reduce memory usage by up to 70% without compromising model performance[Analysis Note - Round 1].\n\n### Hierarchical State Compression\nHierarchical state compression involves compressing different layers or components of the model based on their importance. This can be integrated with gating mechanisms to control quantization levels, ensuring that critical states are preserved while less important ones are compressed more aggressively[Analysis Note - Round 1].\n\n## Efficient Event Detection Mechanisms\n\n### Event-Driven Optimization\nEvent detection can significantly reduce computational overhead by enabling selective computation. This involves detecting important events or changes in the input data and only updating the model when necessary. Integrating event detection with gating mechanisms can further optimize this process by dynamically adapting the model's computation based on the detected events[Analysis Note - Round 1].\n\n### Simplified Graph Operations\nEfficient event detection can also be achieved by simplifying graph operations. For example, using regularization techniques instead of expensive node-to-node matching modules can maintain high-quality learning while reducing computational overhead[Analysis Note - Round 1].\n\n## Integration of Multiple Adaptive Components While Maintaining Model Stability\n\n### Combining Gating Mechanisms with Quantization\nIntegrating gating mechanisms with vector quantization can help maintain model stability while adapting to different input conditions. This involves using gating to control the quantization levels dynamically, ensuring that the model adapts efficiently without compromising stability[Analysis Note - Round 1].\n\n### Hierarchical Approach to State Management\nA hierarchical approach to state management, where different layers or components are managed based on their importance, can help balance compression and accuracy. This approach ensures that critical states are preserved while less important ones are compressed, maintaining overall model stability and performance[Analysis Note - Round 1].\n\n## Techniques for Balancing Compression Ratios with Model Performance\n\n### Importance-Based Compression\nBalancing compression ratios with model performance can be achieved by implementing importance-based compression. This involves compressing less important states or activations more aggressively while preserving critical information. Dynamic compression ratios based on content importance are a key strategy here[Analysis Note - Round 1].\n\n### Adaptive Estimators and Information Compression\nUsing adaptive estimators that show information compression in deep neural networks can also help balance compression and performance. These estimators can adaptively compress information based on its importance, ensuring that the model maintains its performance while reducing memory usage[Analysis Note - Round 1, Reference 4].\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more stable, efficient, and scalable, while maintaining high performance.\n",

SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.03)\n\n*Rui Zhu, Qihang Zhao, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 54  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper successfully implements `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units, and is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language.\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/SpikeGPT.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/43 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\n2023a. Changze Lv, Jianhan Xu, and Xiaoqing Zheng.

We introduce a method to reduce this to linear scaling with time, based on defining attention via latent vectors. The method is readily usable as a drop-in replacement for the standard attention mechanism. Our\"Latte Transformer\"model can be implemented for both bidirectional and unidirectional tasks, with the causal version allowing a recurrent implementation which is memory and time-efficient during inference of language generation tasks. Whilst next token prediction scales linearly with the sequence length for a standard transformer, a Latte Transformer requires constant time to compute the next token. The empirical performance of our method is comparable to standard attention, yet allows scaling to context windows much larger than practical in standard attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/21 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/46 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022.

R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2019)\t**Cited by** 84  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms, and can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations.\n\n**Abstract:** Fast linear transforms are ubiquitous in machine learning, including the discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and other structured transformations such as convolutions. All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/35 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 190-196, 1999.

We focus on designing top-quality LLMs with fewer than a billion parameters, a practical choice for mobile deployment. Contrary to prevailing belief emphasizing the pivotal role of data and parameter quantity in determining model quality, our investigation underscores the significance of model architecture for sub-billion scale LLMs. Leveraging deep and thin architectures, coupled with embedding sharing and grouped-query attention mechanisms, we establish a strong baseline network denoted as MobileLLM, which attains a remarkable 2.7%/4.3% accuracy boost over preceding 125M/350M state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we propose an immediate block-wise weight-sharing approach with no increase in model size and only marginal latency overhead. The resultant models, denoted as MobileLLM-LS, demonstrate a further accuracy enhancement of 0.7%/0.8% than MobileLLM 125M/350M.

Training Spiking Neural Networks with Event-driven Backpropagation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical event-driven neural networks*\n\n*Yaoyu Zhu, Zhaofei Yu, Wei Fang, Xiaodong Xie, Tiejun Huang, T. Masquelier*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper analyzes the commonly used temporal backpropagation training approach and proves that the sum of gradients remains unchanged between fully-connected and convolutional layers, and proposes a backward kernel that can solve the reverse gradient problem for time-based gradients and keep the property of the invariable sum ofGradients.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural networks (SNNs) represent and transmit information by spatiotemporal spike patterns, which bring two major advantages: biological plausibility and suitability for ultralow-power neuromorphic implementation. Despite this, the binary firing characteristic makes training SNNs more challenging. To learn the parameters of deep SNNs in an event-driven fashion as in inference of SNNs, back-propagation with respect to spike timing is proposed. Although this event-driven learning has the advantages of lower computational cost and memory occupation, the accuracy is far below the recurrent neural network-like learning approaches. In this paper, we first analyze the commonly used temporal backpropagation training approach and prove that the sum of gradients remains unchanged between fully-connected and convolutional layers. Secondly, we show that the max pooling layer meets the above invariance rule, while the average pooling layer does not, which will suffer the gradient vanishing problem but can be revised to meet the requirement. Thirdly, we point out the reverse gradient problem for time-based gradients and propose a backward kernel that can solve this problem and keep the property of the invariable sum of gradients. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR10 among time-based training methods. Also, this is the first time that the time-based backpropagation approach successfully trains SNN on the CIFAR100 dataset.

Differentiable hierarchical and surrogate gradient search for spiking neural networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical event-driven neural networks*\n\n*Kaiwei Che, Luziwei Leng, Kaixuan Zhang, Jianguo Zhang, Qinghu Meng, Jie Cheng, Qinghai Guo, Jianxing Liao*\n\n**TL;DR:** A spike-based differentiable hierarchical search (SpikeDHS) framework, where spike- based computation is realized on both the cell and the layer level search space, which finds effective SNN architectures under limited computation cost and exceeds the accuracy of specially designed ANNs meanwhile.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural network (SNN) has been viewed as a potential candidate for the next generation of artificial intelligence with appealing characteristics such as sparse computation and inherent temporal dynamics. By adopting architectures of deep artificial neural networks (ANNs), SNNs are achieving competitive performances in benchmark tasks such as image classification. However, successful architectures of ANNs are not necessary ideal for SNN and when tasks become more diverse effective architectural variations could be critical. To this end, we develop a spike-based differentiable hierarchical search (SpikeDHS) framework, where spike-based computation is realized on both the cell and the layer level search space. Based on this framework, we find effective SNN architectures under limited computation cost. During the training of SNN, a suboptimal surrogate gradient function could lead to poor approximations of true gradients, making the network enter certain local minima. To address this problem, we extend the differential approach to surrogate gradient search where the SG function is efficiently optimized locally. Our models achieve state-of-the-art performances on classification of CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet with accuracy of 95.50%, 76.25% and 68.64%. On event-based deep stereo, our method finds optimal layer variation and surpasses the accuracy of specially designed ANNs meanwhile with 26 \u00d7 lower energy cost ( 6 . 7mJ ), demonstrating the advantage of SNN in processing highly sparse and dynamic signals.

Temporal Effective Batch Normalization in Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical event-driven neural networks*\n\n*Chaoteng Duan, Jianhao Ding, Shiyan Chen, Zhaofei Yu, Tiejun Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results show that SNNs with TEBN outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer time-steps, and achieve better robustness to hyper-parameters than other normalizations.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising in neuromorphic hardware owing to utilizing spatio-temporal information and sparse event-driven signal processing. However, it is challenging to train SNNs due to the non-differentiable nature of the binary firing function. The surrogate gradients alleviate the training problem and make SNNs obtain comparable performance as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with the same structure. Unfortunately, batch normalization, contributing to the success of ANNs, does not play a prominent role in SNNs because of the additional temporal dimension. To this end, we propose an effective normalization method called temporal effective batch normalization (TEBN). By rescaling the presynaptic inputs with different weights at every time-step, temporal distributions become smoother and uniform. Theoretical analysis shows that TEBN can be viewed as a smoother of SNN\u2019s optimization landscape and could help stabilize the gradient norm. Experimental results on both static and neuromorphic datasets show that SNNs with TEBN outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer time-steps, and achieve better robustness to hyper-parameters than other normalizations.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 64  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 4. Adaptive Smoothing Gradient Learning for Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: gradient flow optimization adaptive networks*\n\n*Ziming Wang, Runhao Jiang, S. Lian, Rui Yan, Huajin Tang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a methodology such that training a prototype neural network will evolve into training an SNN gradually by fusing the learnable relaxation degree into the network with random spike noise, in this way, the network learns adaptively the accurate gradients of loss landscape in SNNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) with biologically inspired spatio-temporal dynamics demonstrate superior energy efficiency on neuromorphic architectures. Error backpropagation in SNNs is pro-hibited by the all-or-none nature of spikes. The existing solution circumvents this problem by a relaxation on the gradient calculation using a continuous function with a constant relaxation degree, so-called surrogate gradient learning. Nevertheless, such a solution introduces additional smoothing error on spike firing which leads to the gradients being estimated inaccurately. Thus, how to adaptively adjust the relaxation degree and eliminate smoothing error progressively is crucial. Here, we propose a methodology such that training a prototype neural network will evolve into training an SNN gradually by fusing the learnable relaxation degree into the network with random spike noise. In this way, the network learns adaptively the accurate gradients of loss landscape in SNNs. The theoretical analysis further shows optimization on such a noisy network could be evolved into optimization on the embedded SNN with shared weights progressively. Moreover, The experiments on static images, dynamic event streams, speech, and instrumental sounds show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all the datasets with remarkable robustness on different relaxation degrees.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Implicit Bias of MSE Gradient Optimization in Underparameterized Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: gradient flow optimization adaptive networks*\n\n*Benjamin Bowman, Guido Mont\u00fafar*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is concluded that damped deviations offers a simple and unifying perspective of the dynamics when optimizing the squared error.\n\n**Abstract:** We study the dynamics of a neural network in function space when optimizing the mean squared error via gradient flow. We show that in the underparameterized regime the network learns eigenfunctions of an integral operator TK\u221e determined by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) at rates corresponding to their eigenvalues. For example, for uniformly distributed data on the sphere Sd\u22121 and rotation invariant weight distributions, the eigenfunctions of TK\u221e are the spherical harmonics. Our results can be understood as describing a spectral bias in the underparameterized regime. The proofs use the concept of \u201cDamped Deviations\u201d, where deviations of the NTK matter less for eigendirections with large eigenvalues due to the occurence of a damping factor. Aside from the underparameterized regime, the damped deviations point-of-view can be used to track the dynamics of the empirical risk in the overparameterized setting, allowing us to extend certain results in the literature. We conclude that damped deviations offers a simple and unifying perspective of the dynamics when optimizing the squared error.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Variational Wasserstein gradient flow\n\n*From Search Query: gradient flow optimization adaptive networks*\n\n*JiaoJiao Fan, Qinsheng Zhang, A. Taghvaei, Yongxin Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes to utilize a variational formulation of the objective function formulated as maximization over a parametric class of functions, to handle objective functions involving density, with inner loop updates that only require a small batch of samples and scale well with the dimension.\n\n**Abstract:** Wasserstein gradient flow has emerged as a promising approach to solve optimization problems over the space of probability distributions. A recent trend is to use the well-known JKO scheme in combination with input convex neural networks to numerically implement the proximal step. The most challenging step, in this setup, is to evaluate functions involving density explicitly, such as entropy, in terms of samples. This paper builds on the recent works with a slight but crucial difference: we propose to utilize a variational formulation of the objective function formulated as maximization over a parametric class of functions. Theoretically, the proposed variational formulation allows the construction of gradient flows directly for empirical distributions with a well-defined and meaningful objective function. Computationally, this approach replaces the computationally expensive step in existing methods, to handle objective functions involving density, with inner loop updates that only require a small batch of samples and scale well with the dimension. The performance and scalability of the proposed method are illustrated with the aid of several numerical experiments involving high-dimensional synthetic and real datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 7. HiNeRV: Video Compression with Hierarchical Encoding based Neural Representation\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic compression neural architectures*\n\n*Ho Man Kwan, Ge Gao, Fan Zhang, Andrew Gower, David R. Bull*\n\n**TL;DR:** HiNeRV is an INR that combines light weight layers with novel hierarchical positional encodings and employs depth-wise convolutional, MLP and interpolation layers to build the deep and wide network architecture with high capacity, which offers higher performance and flexibility than existing methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning-based video compression is currently a popular research topic, offering the potential to compete with conventional standard video codecs. In this context, Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have previously been used to represent and compress image and video content, demonstrating relatively high decoding speed compared to other methods. However, existing INR-based methods have failed to deliver rate quality performance comparable with the state of the art in video compression. This is mainly due to the simplicity of the employed network architectures, which limit their representation capability. In this paper, we propose HiNeRV, an INR that combines light weight layers with novel hierarchical positional encodings. We employs depth-wise convolutional, MLP and interpolation layers to build the deep and wide network architecture with high capacity. HiNeRV is also a unified representation encoding videos in both frames and patches at the same time, which offers higher performance and flexibility than existing methods. We further build a video codec based on HiNeRV and a refined pipeline for training, pruning and quantization that can better preserve HiNeRV's performance during lossy model compression. The proposed method has been evaluated on both UVG and MCL-JCV datasets for video compression, demonstrating significant improvement over all existing INRs baselines and competitive performance when compared to learning-based codecs (72.3% overall bit rate saving over HNeRV and 43.4% over DCVC on the UVG dataset, measured in PSNR).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 8. EVC: Towards Real-Time Neural Image Compression with Mask Decay\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic compression neural architectures*\n\n*G. Wang, Jiahao Li, Bin Li, Yan Lu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Both mask decay and residual representation learning greatly improve the RD performance of the scalable encoder, which significantly narrows the performance gap by 50% and 30% for the medium and small models, respectively.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural image compression has surpassed state-of-the-art traditional codecs (H.266/VVC) for rate-distortion (RD) performance, but suffers from large complexity and separate models for different rate-distortion trade-offs. In this paper, we propose an Efficient single-model Variable-bit-rate Codec (EVC), which is able to run at 30 FPS with 768x512 input images and still outperforms VVC for the RD performance. By further reducing both encoder and decoder complexities, our small model even achieves 30 FPS with 1920x1080 input images. To bridge the performance gap between our different capacities models, we meticulously design the mask decay, which transforms the large model's parameters into the small model automatically. And a novel sparsity regularization loss is proposed to mitigate shortcomings of $L_p$ regularization. Our algorithm significantly narrows the performance gap by 50% and 30% for our medium and small models, respectively. At last, we advocate the scalable encoder for neural image compression. The encoding complexity is dynamic to meet different latency requirements. We propose decaying the large encoder multiple times to reduce the residual representation progressively. Both mask decay and residual representation learning greatly improve the RD performance of our scalable encoder.

Graph Neural Networks are Dynamic Programmers\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic compression neural architectures*\n\n*Andrew Dudzik, Petar Velickovic*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows, using methods from category theory and abstract algebra, that there exists an intricate connection between GNNs and DP, going well beyond the initial observations over individual algorithms such as Bellman-Ford.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in neural algorithmic reasoning with graph neural networks (GNNs) are propped up by the notion of algorithmic alignment. Broadly, a neural network will be better at learning to execute a reasoning task (in terms of sample complexity) if its individual components align well with the target algorithm. Specifically, GNNs are claimed to align with dynamic programming (DP), a general problem-solving strategy which expresses many polynomial-time algorithms. However, has this alignment truly been demonstrated and theoretically quantified? Here we show, using methods from category theory and abstract algebra, that there exists an intricate connection between GNNs and DP, going well beyond the initial observations over individual algorithms such as Bellman-Ford. Exposing this connection, we easily verify several prior findings in the literature, produce better-grounded GNN architectures for edge-centric tasks, and demonstrate empirical results on the CLRS algorithmic reasoning benchmark. We hope our exposition will serve as a foundation for building stronger algorithmically aligned GNNs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 53  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. WaveFormer: transformer-based denoising method for gravitational-wave data\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical event-driven neural networks*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** With the advent of gravitational-wave astronomy and the discovery of more compact binary coalescences, data quality improvement techniques are desired to handle the complex and overwhelming noise in gravitational wave (GW) observational data. Though recent machine learning-based studies have shown promising results for data denoising, they are unable to precisely recover both the GW signal amplitude and phase. To address such an issue, we develop a deep neural network centered workflow, WaveFormer, for significant noise suppression and signal recovery on observational data from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). The WaveFormer has a science-driven architecture design with hierarchical feature extraction across a broad frequency spectrum. As a result, the overall noise and glitch are decreased by more than one order of magnitude and the signal recovery error is roughly 1% and 7% for the phase and amplitude, respectively. Moreover, on 75 reported binary black hole (BBH) events of LIGO we obtain a significant improvement of inverse false alarm rate. Our work highlights the potential of large neural networks in gravitational wave data analysis and, while primarily demonstrated on LIGO data, its adaptable design indicates promise for broader application within the International Gravitational-Wave Observatories Network (IGWN) in future observational runs.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-29\n\n\n\n#### 2. The Spike Gating Flow: A Hierarchical Structure Based Spiking Neural Network for Online Gesture Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical event-driven neural networks*\n\n*Yuan Xie, Junwen Luo, C. -J. Richard Shi, Xiaoan Wang, Jiansong Zhang, Fangbo Tao, Tie XU, Qiaosha Zou, Yanhong Wang, Zihao Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Action recognition is an exciting research avenue for artificial intelligence since it may be a game changer in the emerging industrial fields such as robotic visions and automobiles. However, current deep learning faces major challenges for such applications because of the huge computational cost and the inefficient learning. Hence, we develop a novel brain-inspired Spiking Neural Network (SNN) based system titled Spiking Gating Flow (SGF) for online action learning. The developed system consists of multiple SGF units which assembled in a hierarchical manner. A single SGF unit involves three layers: a feature extraction layer, an event-driven layer and a histogram-based training layer. To demonstrate the developed system capabilities, we employ a standard Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) gesture classification as a benchmark. The results indicate that we can achieve 87.5% accuracy which is comparable with Deep Learning (DL), but at smaller training/inference data number ratio 1.5:1. And only a single training epoch is required during the learning process. Meanwhile, to the best of our knowledge, this is the highest accuracy among the non-backpropagation algorithm based SNNs. At last, we conclude the few-shot learning paradigm of the developed network: 1) a hierarchical structure-based network design involves human prior knowledge; 2) SNNs for content based global dynamic feature detection.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-04\n\n\n\n#### 3. On a continuous time model of gradient descent dynamics and instability in deep learning\n\n*From Search Query: gradient flow optimization adaptive networks*\n\n*Benoit Dherin, Chongli Qin, Yan Wu, Mihaela Rosca*\n\n**Abstract:** The recipe behind the success of deep learning has been the combination of neural networks and gradient-based optimization. Understanding the behavior of gradient descent however, and particularly its instability, has lagged behind its empirical success. To add to the theoretical tools available to study gradient descent we propose the principal flow (PF), a continuous time flow that approximates gradient descent dynamics. To our knowledge, the PF is the only continuous flow that captures the divergent and oscillatory behaviors of gradient descent, including escaping local minima and saddle points. Through its dependence on the eigendecomposition of the Hessian the PF sheds light on the recently observed edge of stability phenomena in deep learning. Using our new understanding of instability we propose a learning rate adaptation method which enables us to control the trade-off between training stability and test set evaluation performance.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-03\n\n\n\n#### 4. Old can be Gold: Better Gradient Flow can Make Vanilla-GCNs Great Again\n\n*From Search Query: gradient flow optimization adaptive networks*\n\n*Zhangyang Wang, Ying Ding, Justin F. Rousseau, Tianlong Chen, Peihao Wang, Ajay Jaiswal*\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the enormous success of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) in modeling graph-structured data, most of the current GCNs are shallow due to the notoriously challenging problems of over-smoothening and information squashing along with conventional difficulty caused by vanishing gradients and over-fitting. Previous works have been primarily focused on the study of over-smoothening and over-squashing phenomena in training deep GCNs. Surprisingly, in comparison with CNNs/RNNs, very limited attention has been given to understanding how healthy gradient flow can benefit the trainability of deep GCNs. In this paper, firstly, we provide a new perspective of gradient flow to understand the substandard performance of deep GCNs and hypothesize that by facilitating healthy gradient flow, we can significantly improve their trainability, as well as achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) level performance from vanilla-GCNs. Next, we argue that blindly adopting the Glorot initialization for GCNs is not optimal, and derive a topology-aware isometric initialization scheme for vanilla-GCNs based on the principles of isometry. Additionally, contrary to ad-hoc addition of skip-connections, we propose to use gradient-guided dynamic rewiring of vanilla-GCNs} with skip connections. Our dynamic rewiring method uses the gradient flow within each layer during training to introduce on-demand skip-connections adaptively. We provide extensive empirical evidence across multiple datasets that our methods improve gradient flow in deep vanilla-GCNs and significantly boost their performance to comfortably compete and outperform many fancy state-of-the-art methods.

Compound Word Transformer: Learning to Compose Full-Song Music over Dynamic Directed Hypergraphs\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic compression neural architectures*\n\n*Yi-Hsuan Yang, Yin-Cheng Yeh, Jen-Yu Liu, Wen-Yi Hsiao*\n\n**Abstract:** To apply neural sequence models such as the Transformers to music generation tasks, one has to represent a piece of music by a sequence of tokens drawn from a finite set of pre-defined vocabulary. Such a vocabulary usually involves tokens of various types. For example, to describe a musical note, one needs separate tokens to indicate the note's pitch, duration, velocity (dynamics), and placement (onset time) along the time grid. While different types of tokens may possess different properties, existing models usually treat them equally, in the same way as modeling words in natural languages. In this paper, we present a conceptually different approach that explicitly takes into account the type of the tokens, such as note types and metric types. And, we propose a new Transformer decoder architecture that uses different feed-forward heads to model tokens of different types. With an expansion-compression trick, we convert a piece of music to a sequence of compound words by grouping neighboring tokens, greatly reducing the length of the token sequences. We show that the resulting model can be viewed as a learner over dynamic directed hypergraphs. And, we employ it to learn to compose expressive Pop piano music of full-song length (involving up to 10K individual tokens per song), both conditionally and unconditionally. Our experiment shows that, compared to state-of-the-art models, the proposed model converges 5--10 times faster at training (i.e., within a day on a single GPU with 11 GB memory), and with comparable quality in the generated music.\n\n**Published:** 2021-01-07\n\n\n\n#### 6. Evaluation of CNN-based Automatic Music Tagging Models\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic compression neural architectures*\n\n*Minz Won, Andres Ferraro, Xavier Serra, Dmitry Bogdanov*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning accelerated the development of content-based automatic music tagging systems. Music information retrieval (MIR) researchers proposed various architecture designs, mainly based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), that achieve state-of-the-art results in this multi-label binary classification task. However, due to the differences in experimental setups followed by researchers, such as using different dataset splits and software versions for evaluation, it is difficult to compare the proposed architectures directly with each other. To facilitate further research, in this paper we conduct a consistent evaluation of different music tagging models on three datasets (MagnaTagATune, Million Song Dataset, and MTG-Jamendo) and provide reference results using common evaluation metrics (ROC-AUC and PR-AUC). Furthermore, all the models are evaluated with perturbed inputs to investigate the generalization capabilities concerning time stretch, pitch shift, dynamic range compression, and addition of white noise. For reproducibility, we provide the PyTorch implementations with the pre-trained models.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hierarchical event-driven processing, gradient flow optimization, dynamic compression, and efficient implementations, here are some key insights and relevant references:\n\n## Methods for Integrating Hierarchical Compression with Event-Driven Processing\n\n- The concept of hierarchical processing can be inspired by the hierarchical RL approach described in the Salesforce blog. This approach involves breaking down tasks into smaller parts using a hierarchy of policy networks, which can be adapted for hierarchical compression in neural networks. By decomposing tasks into simpler subtasks, you can implement hierarchical compression where each level of the hierarchy can apply different compression strategies based on the importance of the data.\n\n- The use of developmental plasticity-inspired adaptive pruning (DPAP) as described in the arXiv paper can also be integrated with hierarchical compression. DPAP dynamically prunes redundant synapses and neurons based on their activity levels, which can be applied at multiple hierarchical levels to optimize compression.\n\n## Techniques for Optimizing Gradient Flow in Adaptive Neural Architectures\n\n- The AdaBelief optimizer, mentioned in the analysis note, is a technique that adapts the stepsize according to the 'belief' in the current gradient direction. This can help stabilize the training of complex adaptive models by adjusting the learning rate based on the deviation of the observed gradient from the predicted gradient[Analysis Note].\n\n- Layer normalization, as discussed in the analysis note, is effective in stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks, which can be crucial for maintaining stable gradient flow in adaptive architectures[Analysis Note].\n\n## Approaches for Dynamically Adapting Compression Ratios Based on Input Characteristics\n\n- Dynamic compression ratios can be achieved by using importance-based regularization and adaptive learning rates. For example, the LoSparse method combines low-rank and sparse approximations for weight matrices, which can be dynamically adjusted based on the importance scores of the input data[Analysis Note].\n\n- The DPAP method also allows for dynamic pruning based on neuronal activity levels, which can be extended to adapt compression ratios based on the input characteristics and their importance.\n\n## Integration of Multiple Adaptive Mechanisms in Neural Networks\n\n- Integrating multiple adaptive mechanisms such as hierarchical compression, dynamic pruning, and adaptive learning rates can be achieved by combining techniques like AdaBelief optimization, layer normalization, and DPAP. For instance, using AdaBelief for stable training, layer normalization for stable hidden states, and DPAP for dynamic pruning can create a robust and adaptive neural architecture[Analysis Note].\n\n## Efficient Implementations of Hierarchical Event Processing\n\n- The SparseProp method for efficient event-based simulation and training of sparse recurrent spiking neural networks can be adapted for hierarchical event processing. This method reduces the computational cost of both forward and backward pass operations, enabling efficient simulations of large spiking networks[Analysis Note].\n\n- Event-driven design principles, as discussed in the Restack article, emphasize the use of hierarchical and modular architectures inspired by the human brain. These architectures can process information in layers, effectively managing complexity and data volume, which is crucial for efficient hierarchical event processing.\n\nBy combining these approaches, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that integrate hierarchical compression with event-driven processing, optimize gradient flow in adaptive architectures, dynamically adapt compression ratios, and implement efficient hierarchical event processing.\n",

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Rui Zhu, Qihang Zhao, J.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations.

(2019), codebooks are parameterized using EMA-smoothed k-means. ### 3.4.2 TRAINING UPDATES\n\nInstead of updating on the full sequence loss given above, we generally update every $W / L$ query blocks, where $W \\ll T$, which resembles a strategy used in prior works Dai et al., 2019, Wu et al., 2022, Hutchins et al. 2022). Each update is obtained by backpropagating through a window of $W$ timesteps, with gradients computed on the corresponding terms in the per-token average losses above. Codebooks are also updated every $W / L$ query blocks. When $W / L=1$, using Theorem 3.7 is an efficient equivalent to a variable-length key-value cache. When $W / L>1$, a learning signal is sent through any value vectors added to the compressed cache within the backpropagation window. ## 4 RELATED WORK\n\n### 4.1 Hierarchical AtTENTION\n\nCombiner Ren et al. 2021) proposes an approximation of softmax using a simple graphical model, and parameterizes its internal probabilities using max-pooling over query/key features, enabling decoder-only self-attention in subquadratic time. H-Transformer-1D (Zhu \\& Soricut, 2021) uses average-pooling operations over queries/keys to reduce the complexity of encoder-only self-attention. Transformer-LS (Zhu et al. 2021) uses dynamic projections to downsample long-range features in transformers by a user-specified factor. Hourglass Transformer (Nawrot et al. 2021) and MegaByte (Yu et al. 2023) eschew pooling in favor of convolutions or reshaping for temporal downsampling, and apply these techniques to reduce computation in the interior layers of decoder-only transformers. Transformer-VQ differs from these works in that it uses vector quantization (VQ), a well-understood method for compression, instead of newly-designed heuristic methods. In addition, it does not rely on token contiguity to guide the compression process. Instead, it utilizes an equivalence to dense attention. Notably, Transformer-VQ is easier to sample from compared to previous hierarchical attention models; since the cache update logic can be equivalently applied every token instead of every $L$ tokens, there are no sporadic 'feature consolidation' operations required during sampling. ### 4.2 KERNELIZABLE ATTENTION\n\nKernelizable attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020, Choromanski et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) computes query and key features and applies the same nonlinearity to both of them separately, omitting additional nonlinearities when computing attention weights. By using the associativity of matrix multiplication, kernelized attention reduces attention to linear complexity. Transformer-VQ is distinguished from kernelizable attention through an asymmetric treatment of queries and keys, a deterministic equivalence to softmax-based attention, training stability, and strong quantitative results on long-context autoregressive modeling benchmarks. Clustering attention (Vyas et al. 2020) uses vector-quantized queries and is also kernelizable. However, it requires learning per-layer codebooks for each sequence and uses a modified form of Lloyd's iterations based on Hamming distance and locality-sensitive hashing. This yields a complex non-causal algorithm which is only suitable for non-causal attention and is slow on TPUs. Transformer-VQ is strongly differentiated from clustering attention by its simplicity, applicability to decoder-only tasks, efficiency on TPUs, and large-scale experimental validation. ### 4.3 COMPRESSIVE ATTENTION\n\nCompressive Transformers (Rae et al. 2020) directly learn a compression function for long-range features. LUNA (Ma et al., 2021) and Recurrent Transformers (Bulatov et al., 2022, Hutchins et al., 2022) use cross-attention to compress long-range features into a recurrent state. Notably, our model implements a kind of block-recurrent mechanism for its cache, but is significantly more parameter-efficient than the mechanisms proposed by Ma et al.\n```\n\n#### 4.

In these retrieval augmented models, the model is conditioned on documents from the training corpus or a knowledge base, with the hope that information from related articles can help improve the factual accuracy of the models. Discrete latent models for sequences Discrete latent models using Vector Quantization (VQ) have been widely used in speech (van den Oord et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018; Schneider et al., 2019) to learn unsupervised representations of audio signals. Their use for modeling text sequences were studied in Kaiser et al. (2018); Roy et al. (2018) where the motivation was to reduce the inference latency for neural machine translation models by decoding in the latent space. $N$-gram models for statistical language modeling $N$-gram models have a long history in statistical modeling of language, see e.g., Brown et al. (1992, 1993); Katz (1987); Kneser and Ney (1995); Chen and Goodman (1999). Before the advent of word vectors and distributed representations of language via neural networks (Mikolov et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2016), $n$-gram language models were the standard in the field of statistical language modeling. More recent related work on combining neural sequence models with $n$-gram information is due to Sun and Iyyer (2021) who propose concatenating the representations within a local context, while Huang et al. (2021) propose combining RNN models with $n$-gram embedding tables. Our work differs from them in that we use an $n$-gram look-up table on a discrete latent representation of the sequence, which leads to a more meaningful assignment of shared $n$-gram representations.

(2016); Hinton \\& Plaut (1987). In the brain, short-term and long-term memory have developed in a specialized way. Short-term memory is allowed to change very quickly to react to immediate sensory inputs and perception. It also tends towards high capacity storage of all pieces of information which may be relevant for future reasoning Jonides et al. (2008); Atkinson \\& Shiffrin (1971); Averbach \\& Coriell (1961). By contrast, long-term memory changes slowly Kolodner (1983); Jeneson \\& Squire (2012), is highly selective and involves repeated consolidation. It contains a set of memories that summarize the entire past, only storing details about observations which are most relevant Goelet et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 14 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: temporal vector quantization neural networks, hierarchical adaptive compression techniques, multi-mechanism integration stability\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. VQ-GNN: A Universal Framework to Scale up Graph Neural Networks using Vector Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: temporal vector quantization neural networks*\n\n*Mucong Ding, Kezhi Kong, Jingling Li, Chen Zhu, John P. Dickerson, Furong Huang, T. Goldstein*\n\n**TL;DR:** VQ-GNN, a universal framework to scale up any convolution-based GNNs using Vector Quantization (VQ) without compromising the performance, is proposed and it is shown that such a compact low-rank version of the gigantic convolution matrix is sufficient both theoretically and experimentally.\n\n**Abstract:** Most state-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can be defined as a form of graph convolution which can be realized by message passing between direct neighbors or beyond. To scale such GNNs to large graphs, various neighbor-, layer-, or subgraph-sampling techniques are proposed to alleviate the\"neighbor explosion\"problem by considering only a small subset of messages passed to the nodes in a mini-batch. However, sampling-based methods are difficult to apply to GNNs that utilize many-hops-away or global context each layer, show unstable performance for different tasks and datasets, and do not speed up model inference. We propose a principled and fundamentally different approach, VQ-GNN, a universal framework to scale up any convolution-based GNNs using Vector Quantization (VQ) without compromising the performance. In contrast to sampling-based techniques, our approach can effectively preserve all the messages passed to a mini-batch of nodes by learning and updating a small number of quantized reference vectors of global node representations, using VQ within each GNN layer. Our framework avoids the\"neighbor explosion\"problem of GNNs using quantized representations combined with a low-rank version of the graph convolution matrix. We show that such a compact low-rank version of the gigantic convolution matrix is sufficient both theoretically and experimentally. In company with VQ, we design a novel approximated message passing algorithm and a nontrivial back-propagation rule for our framework. Experiments on various types of GNN backbones demonstrate the scalability and competitive performance of our framework on large-graph node classification and link prediction benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 38  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2. Codebook Features: Sparse and Discrete Interpretability for Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: temporal vector quantization neural networks*\n\n*Alex Tamkin, Mohammad Taufeeque, Noah D. Goodman*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies codes in Transformer language models representing diverse, disentangled concepts and finds that they can guide the model to generate different topics by activating the appropriate codes during inference, and appears to be a promising unit of analysis and control for neural networks and interpretability.\n\n**Abstract:** Understanding neural networks is challenging in part because of the dense, continuous nature of their hidden states. We explore whether we can train neural networks to have hidden states that are sparse, discrete, and more interpretable by quantizing their continuous features into what we call codebook features. Codebook features are produced by finetuning neural networks with vector quantization bottlenecks at each layer, producing a network whose hidden features are the sum of a small number of discrete vector codes chosen from a larger codebook. Surprisingly, we find that neural networks can operate under this extreme bottleneck with only modest degradation in performance. This sparse, discrete bottleneck also provides an intuitive way of controlling neural network behavior: first, find codes that activate when the desired behavior is present, then activate those same codes during generation to elicit that behavior. We validate our approach by training codebook Transformers on several different datasets. First, we explore a finite state machine dataset with far more hidden states than neurons. In this setting, our approach overcomes the superposition problem by assigning states to distinct codes, and we find that we can make the neural network behave as if it is in a different state by activating the code for that state. Second, we train Transformer language models with up to 410M parameters on two natural language datasets. We identify codes in these models representing diverse, disentangled concepts (ranging from negative emotions to months of the year) and find that we can guide the model to generate different topics by activating the appropriate codes during inference. Overall, codebook features appear to be a promising unit of analysis and control for neural networks and interpretability.

Straightening Out the Straight-Through Estimator: Overcoming Optimization Challenges in Vector Quantized Networks\n\n*From Search Query: temporal vector quantization neural networks*\n\n*Minyoung Huh, Brian Cheung, Pulkit Agrawal, Phillip Isola*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work examines the challenges of training neural networks using vector quantization using straight-through estimation and proposes an improvement to the commitment loss to ensure better alignment between the codebook representation and the model embedding.\n\n**Abstract:** This work examines the challenges of training neural networks using vector quantization using straight-through estimation. We find that a primary cause of training instability is the discrepancy between the model embedding and the code-vector distribution. We identify the factors that contribute to this issue, including the codebook gradient sparsity and the asymmetric nature of the commitment loss, which leads to misaligned code-vector assignments. We propose to address this issue via affine re-parameterization of the code vectors. Additionally, we introduce an alternating optimization to reduce the gradient error introduced by the straight-through estimation. Moreover, we propose an improvement to the commitment loss to ensure better alignment between the codebook representation and the model embedding. These optimization methods improve the mathematical approximation of the straight-through estimation and, ultimately, the model performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on several common model architectures, such as AlexNet, ResNet, and ViT, across various tasks, including image classification and generative modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4.

Abbeel, Jonathan Ho*\n\n**TL;DR:** Bit-Swap is proposed, a new compression scheme that generalizes BB-ANS and achieves strictly better compression rates for hierarchical latent variable models with Markov chain structure and results in lossless compression rates that are empirically superior to existing techniques.\n\n**Abstract:** The bits-back argument suggests that latent variable models can be turned into lossless compression schemes. Translating the bits-back argument into efficient and practical lossless compression schemes for general latent variable models, however, is still an open problem. Bits-Back with Asymmetric Numeral Systems (BB-ANS), recently proposed by Townsend et al. (2019), makes bits-back coding practically feasible for latent variable models with one latent layer, but it is inefficient for hierarchical latent variable models. In this paper we propose Bit-Swap, a new compression scheme that generalizes BB-ANS and achieves strictly better compression rates for hierarchical latent variable models with Markov chain structure. Through experiments we verify that Bit-Swap results in lossless compression rates that are empirically superior to existing techniques.

Recent advancements in the field provide several mechanisms for speeding up the training, including {\\em compressed communication}, {\\em variance reduction} and {\\em acceleration}. However, none of these methods is capable of exploiting the inherently rich data-dependent smoothness structure of the local losses beyond standard smoothness constants. In this paper, we argue that when training supervised models, {\\em smoothness matrices} -- information-rich generalizations of the ubiquitous smoothness constants -- can and should be exploited for further dramatic gains, both in theory and practice. In order to further alleviate the communication burden inherent in distributed optimization, we propose a novel communication sparsification strategy that can take full advantage of the smoothness matrices associated with local losses. To showcase the power of this tool, we describe how our sparsification technique can be adapted to three distributed optimization algorithms -- DCGD, DIANA and ADIANA -- yielding significant savings in terms of communication complexity. The new methods always outperform the baselines, often dramatically so.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6. Adaptive Estimators Show Information Compression in Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical adaptive compression techniques*\n\n*Ivan Chelombiev, Conor J. Houghton, Cian O\u2019Donnell*\n\n**TL;DR:** More robust mutual information estimation techniques are developed, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions, which explore compression in networks with a range of different activation functions.\n\n**Abstract:** To improve how neural networks function it is crucial to understand their learning process. The information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes that neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their representations to disregard information that is not relevant to the task. However, empirical evidence for this theory is conflicting, as compression was only observed when networks used saturating activation functions. In contrast, networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of task performance but did not show compression. In this paper we developed more robust mutual information estimation techniques, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions. Using these adaptive estimation techniques, we explored compression in networks with a range of different activation functions. With two improved methods of estimation, firstly, we show that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression, and the amount of compression varies between different activation functions. We also find that there is a large amount of variation in compression between different network initializations. Secondary, we see that L2 regularization leads to significantly increased compression, while preventing overfitting. Finally, we show that only compression of the last layer is positively correlated with generalization.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 7.

However, existing methods tend to provide human-unfriendly interpretation, and are prone to sub-optimal performance due to one-side promotion, i.e. either inference promotion with interpretation or vice versa. In this paper, we propose a multi-level Mutual Promotion mechanism for self-evolved Inference and sentence-level Interpretation (MPII). Specifically, from the model-level, we propose a Step-wise Integration Mechanism to jointly perform and deeply integrate inference and interpretation in an autoregressive manner. From the optimization-level, we propose an Adversarial Fidelity Regularization to improve the fidelity between inference and interpretation with the Adversarial Mutual Information training strategy. Extensive experiments on NLI and CQA tasks reveal that the proposed MPII approach can significantly outperform baseline models for both the inference performance and the interpretation quality.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9.

Specifically, communication mechanism, intent, and semantic frame are imported as multi-grained signals that control the empathy realization from coarse to fine levels. We then design a specific masking strategy to reflect the relationship between multi-grained signals and response tokens, and integrate it into the diffusion model to influence the generative process.

Vector Quantized Time Series Generation with a Bidirectional Prior Model\n\n*From Search Query: temporal vector quantization neural networks*\n\n*Erlend Aune, Sara Malacarne, Daesoo Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** Time series generation (TSG) studies have mainly focused on the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) combined with recurrent neural network (RNN) variants. However, the fundamental limitations and challenges of training GANs still remain. In addition, the RNN-family typically has difficulties with temporal consistency between distant timesteps. Motivated by the successes in the image generation (IMG) domain, we propose TimeVQVAE, the first work, to our knowledge, that uses vector quantization (VQ) techniques to address the TSG problem. Moreover, the priors of the discrete latent spaces are learned with bidirectional transformer models that can better capture global temporal consistency. We also propose VQ modeling in a time-frequency domain, separated into low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF). This allows us to retain important characteristics of the time series and, in turn, generate new synthetic signals that are of better quality, with sharper changes in modularity, than its competing TSG methods. Our experimental evaluation is conducted on all datasets from the UCR archive, using well-established metrics in the IMG literature, such as Fr\\'echet inception distance and inception scores.

APCodec: A Neural Audio Codec with Parallel Amplitude and Phase Spectrum Encoding and Decoding\n\n*From Search Query: temporal vector quantization neural networks*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces a novel neural audio codec targeting high waveform sampling rates and low bitrates named APCodec, which seamlessly integrates the strengths of parametric codecs and waveform codecs. The APCodec revolutionizes the process of audio encoding and decoding by concurrently handling the amplitude and phase spectra as audio parametric characteristics like parametric codecs. It is composed of an encoder and a decoder with the modified ConvNeXt v2 network as the backbone, connected by a quantizer based on the residual vector quantization (RVQ) mechanism. The encoder compresses the audio amplitude and phase spectra in parallel, amalgamating them into a continuous latent code at a reduced temporal resolution. This code is subsequently quantized by the quantizer. Ultimately, the decoder reconstructs the audio amplitude and phase spectra in parallel, and the decoded waveform is obtained by inverse short-time Fourier transform. To ensure the fidelity of decoded audio like waveform codecs, spectral-level loss, quantization loss, and generative adversarial network (GAN) based loss are collectively employed for training the APCodec. To support low-latency streamable inference, we employ feed-forward layers and causal deconvolutional layers in APCodec, incorporating a knowledge distillation training strategy to enhance the quality of decoded audio. Experimental results confirm that our proposed APCodec can encode 48 kHz audio at bitrate of just 6 kbps, with no significant degradation in the quality of the decoded audio. At the same bitrate, our proposed APCodec also demonstrates superior decoded audio quality and faster generation speed compared to well-known codecs, such as Encodec, AudioDec and DAC.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-16\n\n\n\n#### 3. Comb, Prune, Distill: Towards Unified Pruning for Vision Model Compression\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical adaptive compression techniques*\n\n*Rainer Stiefelhagen, Jiaming Zhang, Junwei Zheng, Ruiping Liu, Jonas Schmitt*\n\n**Abstract:** Lightweight and effective models are essential for devices with limited resources, such as intelligent vehicles. Structured pruning offers a promising approach to model compression and efficiency enhancement. However, existing methods often tie pruning techniques to specific model architectures or vision tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel unified pruning framework Comb, Prune, Distill (CPD), which addresses both model-agnostic and task-agnostic concerns simultaneously. Our framework employs a combing step to resolve hierarchical layer-wise dependency issues, enabling architecture independence. Additionally, the pruning pipeline adaptively remove parameters based on the importance scoring metrics regardless of vision tasks. To support the model in retaining its learned information, we introduce knowledge distillation during the pruning step. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalizability of our framework, encompassing both convolutional neural network (CNN) and transformer models, as well as image classification and segmentation tasks. In image classification we achieve a speedup of up to x4.3 with a accuracy loss of 1.8% and in semantic segmentation up to x1.89 with a 5.1% loss in mIoU.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-06\n\n\n\n#### 4.

This representation is storage-efficient, less ambiguous, and more informative, thus facilitating large-scale autonomy and the acquisition of actionable information in highly unstructured, GPS-denied environments. In this letter, we propose an integrated system that can perform large-scale autonomous flights and real-time semantic mapping in challenging under-canopy environments. We detect and model tree trunks and ground planes from LiDAR data, which are associated across scans and used to constrain robot poses as well as tree trunk models. The autonomous navigation module utilizes a multi-level planning and mapping framework and computes dynamically feasible trajectories that lead the UAV to build a semantic map of the user-defined region of interest in a computationally and storage efficient manner. A drift-compensation mechanism is designed to minimize the odometry drift using semantic SLAM outputs in real time, while maintaining planner optimality and controller stability.

Enhancing the Transferability of Adversarial Attacks through Variance Tuning\n\n*From Search Query: multi-mechanism integration stability*\n\n*Kun He, Xiaosen Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples that mislead the models with imperceptible perturbations. Though adversarial attacks have achieved incredible success rates in the white-box setting, most existing adversaries often exhibit weak transferability in the black-box setting, especially under the scenario of attacking models with defense mechanisms. In this work, we propose a new method called variance tuning to enhance the class of iterative gradient based attack methods and improve their attack transferability. Specifically, at each iteration for the gradient calculation, instead of directly using the current gradient for the momentum accumulation, we further consider the gradient variance of the previous iteration to tune the current gradient so as to stabilize the update direction and escape from poor local optima. Empirical results on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our method could significantly improve the transferability of gradient-based adversarial attacks. Besides, our method could be used to attack ensemble models or be integrated with various input transformations. Incorporating variance tuning with input transformations on iterative gradient-based attacks in the multi-model setting, the integrated method could achieve an average success rate of 90.1% against nine advanced defense methods, improving the current best attack performance significantly by 85.1% . Code is available at https://github.com/JHL-HUST/VT.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-03-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, especially in the context of integrating temporal normalization with vector quantization, hierarchical event processing with adaptive compression, and ensuring stability when combining multiple adaptive mechanisms, here are some relevant insights and techniques from the provided sources and additional analysis:\n\n## Methods for Integrating Temporal Normalization with Vector Quantization\n\n- The concept of **temporal effective batch normalization (TEBN)** can be adapted to stabilize the training of models that incorporate vector quantization. TEBN smooths the temporal distributions of inputs, which could help in maintaining stable hidden states when combined with vector quantization layers.\n- The \"rotation trick\" proposed in the context of vector quantized-Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAEs) can help in propagating gradients smoothly through the vector quantization layer. This method ensures that gradients flow back from the decoder to the encoder unimpeded, which could be crucial for integrating temporal normalization techniques.\n\n## Techniques for Hierarchical Event Processing with Adaptive Compression\n\n- **Hierarchical compression** techniques, such as those described in the context of video compression, can be adapted for language models. For instance, hierarchical encoding based on importance can be used to dynamically adjust compression ratios based on the temporal importance of the data. This approach can be integrated with event-driven state updates to optimize computational overhead.\n- **Event-driven state updates** with adaptive compression can be implemented by using techniques like SparseProp, which demonstrates efficient event-based simulation and training. This can help in reducing computational overhead while maintaining the accuracy of the model[Analysis Note - Round 3].\n\n## Approaches for Ensuring Stability When Combining Multiple Adaptive Mechanisms\n\n- **AdaBelief optimization** can be used to stabilize the training of complex adaptive models. Combining AdaBelief with layer normalization techniques, such as TEBN, can help maintain stable hidden states and ensure robust gradient flow[Analysis Note - Round 3].\n- **Adaptive smoothing gradient learning** can help in optimizing the network to learn accurate gradients of the loss landscape, even in noisy environments. This approach can be particularly useful when combining multiple adaptive mechanisms to ensure stability and accurate gradient estimation[Analysis Note - Round 3].\n\n## Efficient Implementations of Temporal-Aware Compression\n\n- **Vector quantization regularized latent spaces**, as discussed in the context of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), can achieve high sample quality despite some diminishment in reconstruction capabilities. This approach can be adapted for temporal-aware compression in language models, ensuring efficient use of latent spaces.\n- **Continuous-time neural networks**, such as CellNNs, can offer substantial benefits in terms of sample quality by directly executing diffusion processes. While this is more relevant to image generation, the concept of continuous-time processing can inspire more efficient temporal-aware compression techniques in language models.\n\n## Integration Strategies for Combining Temporal and Event-Driven Processing\n\n- **Temporal-aware processing** can be integrated with event-driven state updates by using techniques that analyze temporal information, such as those inspired by hyperdimensional computing principles. This involves recognizing firing patterns over time and incorporating temporal information into the decoding procedures, which can be adapted for language models to handle temporal and event-driven data efficiently.\n- **Hierarchical event detection with importance scoring** can help in efficiently processing events by prioritizing the most important temporal information. This approach can be combined with adaptive compression to optimize the model's performance and reduce computational overhead[Analysis Note - Round 3].\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop more robust, efficient, and scalable autoregressive language models that leverage temporal normalization, hierarchical adaptive compression, and stable multi-mechanism integration.\n",

Weighted Grouped Query Attention in Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.03)\n\n*Sai Sena Chinnakonduru, Astarag Mohapatra*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA), is proposed, introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning.\n\n**Abstract:** The attention mechanism forms the foundational blocks for transformer language models. Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 10  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper seeks to enable compute and memory cost per token in any pre-trained long convolution architecture to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput during generation, and introduces architectural improvements to convolution-based layers such as Hyena.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in attention-free sequence models rely on convolutions as alternatives to the attention operator at the core of Transformers. In particular, long convolution sequence models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many domains, but incur a significant cost during auto-regressive inference workloads -- naively requiring a full pass (or caching of activations) over the input sequence for each generated token -- similarly to attention-based models. In this paper, we seek to enable $\\mathcal O(1)$ compute and memory cost per token in any pre-trained long convolution architecture to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput during generation. Concretely, our methods consist in extracting low-dimensional linear state-space models from each convolution layer, building upon rational interpolation and model-order reduction techniques. We further introduce architectural improvements to convolution-based layers such as Hyena: by weight-tying the filters across channels into heads, we achieve higher pre-training quality and reduce the number of filters to be distilled. The resulting model achieves 10x higher throughput than Transformers and 1.5x higher than Hyena at 1.3B parameters, without any loss in quality after distillation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/64 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nThe U.S. Government is authorized to reproduce and distribute reprints for Governmental purposes notwithstanding any copyright notation thereon.

Efficiency Our distillation methods for constant-memory, high throughput inference in long convolution sequence models (LCSMs) can lead to energy savings during model deployement, enabling processing of longer-form content at a fraction of the cost and reducing environmental impact. Improved efficiency may also affect other aspects of AI safety, as it may make it easier produce malicious or harmful content.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/38 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 42/46 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\n[N/A]\n(b) Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?

This work takes inspiration from a wide array of work on introducing multiple scales of processing into recurrent neural networks (Chung et al. 2016; Hihi \\& Bengio, 1995; Mozer, 1991, Schmidhuber, 1991, Koutn\u00edk et al., 2014). These works divide the processing into multiple streams each operating at a different temporal granularity. While these works mainly focus on recurrent neural networks and their application is mainly on natural language tasks, we focus on introducing multiple streams of processing and a hierarchical structure into Transformers while also focusing on a broader range of domains beyond natural language. Transformers. Some of the components we describe in the proposed model have been used previously in various Transformer models. Transformer XL (Dai et al., 2019) also divides the input into segments. Each segment considers the tokens from the current segment and the previous segment for attention without passing gradients into the previous segments. A number of previous works (Zhang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021b, Wu et al., 2021, Yuan et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021) have worked on introducing a hierarchical structure in Transformers mainly in the domain of vision. The main goal of these works has been to introduce convolution-like hierarchies into Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020). While these works progressively reduce the spatial resolution of the inputs in order to introduce hierarchies, we introduce hierarchies by adding another slow stream of information processing and without reducing the spatial resolution of the inputs. We also provision for the higher level of the hierarchy (i.e. the slow stream) to provide information to the lower levels as top-down conditioning which is not possible in any of the previous works. Top-Down Conditioning. Top-down information is information propagated from higher to lower levels of the network.

Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Linear Symmetric Quantization of Neural Networks for Low-precision Integer Hardware\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficiency implementation*\n\n*Xiandong Zhao, Ying Wang, Xuyi Cai, Cheng Liu, Lei Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A learned linear symmetric quantizer for integer neural network processors is proposed, which not only quantizes neural parameters and activations to low-bit integer but also accelerates hardware inference by using batch normalization fusion and low-precision accumulators and multipliers.\n\n**Abstract:** With the proliferation of specialized neural network processors that operate on low-precision integers, the performance of Deep Neural Network inference becomes increasingly dependent on the result of quantization. Despite plenty of prior work on the quantization of weights or activations for neural networks, there is still a wide gap between the software quantizers and the low-precision accelerator implementation, which degrades either the efficiency of networks or that of the hardware for the lack of software and hardware coordination at design-phase. In this paper, we propose a learned linear symmetric quantizer for integer neural network processors, which not only quantizes neural parameters and activations to low-bit integer but also accelerates hardware inference by using batch normalization fusion and low-precision accumulators (e.g., 16-bit) and multipliers (e.g., 4-bit). We use a unified way to quantize weights and activations, and the results outperform many previous approaches for various networks such as AlexNet, ResNet, and lightweight models like MobileNet while keeping friendly to the accelerator architecture. Additional, we also apply the method to object detection models and witness high performance and accuracy in YOLO-v2. Finally, we deploy the quantized models on our specialized integer-arithmetic-only DNN accelerator to show the effectiveness of the proposed quantizer. We show that even with linear symmetric quantization, the results can be better than asymmetric or non-linear methods in 4-bit networks. In evaluation, the proposed quantizer induces less than 0.4\\% accuracy drop in ResNet18, ResNet34, and AlexNet when quantizing the whole network as required by the integer processors.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 58  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 3. Bag of Tricks for Optimizing Transformer Efficiency\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficiency implementation*\n\n*Ye Lin, Yanyang Li, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper shows that the efficiency of Transformer can be improved by combining some simple and hardware-agnostic methods, including tuning hyper-parameters, better design choices and training strategies.\n\n**Abstract:** Improving Transformer efficiency has become increasingly attractive recently. A wide range of methods has been proposed, e.g., pruning, quantization, new architectures and etc. But these methods are either sophisticated in implementation or dependent on hardware. In this paper, we show that the efficiency of Transformer can be improved by combining some simple and hardware-agnostic methods, including tuning hyper-parameters, better design choices and training strategies. On the WMT news translation tasks, we improve the inference efficiency of a strong Transformer system by 3.80X on CPU and 2.52X on GPU.

A New Benchmark and Reverse Validation Method for Passage-level Hallucination Detection\n\n*From Search Query: empirical validation methods*\n\n*Shiping Yang, Renliang Sun, Xiao-Yi Wan*\n\n**TL;DR:** A self-check approach based on reverse validation to detect factual errors automatically in a zero-resource fashion to detect hallucinations in large Language Models, and considerably outperforms the baselines while costing fewer tokens and less time.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown their ability to collaborate effectively with humans in real-world scenarios. However, LLMs are apt to generate hallucinations, i.e., makeup incorrect text and unverified information, which can cause significant damage when deployed for mission-critical tasks. In this paper, we propose a self-check approach based on reverse validation to detect factual errors automatically in a zero-resource fashion. To facilitate future studies and assess different methods, we construct a hallucination detection benchmark named PHD, which is generated by ChatGPT and annotated by human annotators. Contrasting previous studies of zero-resource hallucination detection, our method and benchmark concentrate on passage-level detection instead of sentence-level. We empirically evaluate our method and existing zero-resource detection methods on two datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method considerably outperforms the baselines while costing fewer tokens and less time. Furthermore, we manually analyze some hallucination cases that LLM failed to capture, revealing the shared limitation of zero-resource methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 28  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Expected Validation Performance and Estimation of a Random Variable's Maximum\n\n*From Search Query: empirical validation methods*\n\n*Jesse Dodge, Suchin Gururangan, Dallas Card, Roy Schwartz, Noah A. Smith*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper analyzes three statistical estimators for expected validation performance, a tool used for reporting performance as a function of computational budget, and finds that the two biased estimators lead to the fewest incorrect conclusions, which hints at the importance of minimizing variance and MSE.\n\n**Abstract:** Research in NLP is often supported by experimental results, and improved reporting of such results can lead to better understanding and more reproducible science. In this paper we analyze three statistical estimators for expected validation performance, a tool used for reporting performance (e.g., accuracy) as a function of computational budget (e.g., number of hyperparameter tuning experiments). Where previous work analyzing such estimators focused on the bias, we also examine the variance and mean squared error (MSE). In both synthetic and realistic scenarios, we evaluate three estimators and find the unbiased estimator has the highest variance, and the estimator with the smallest variance has the largest bias; the estimator with the smallest MSE strikes a balance between bias and variance, displaying a classic bias-variance tradeoff. We use expected validation performance to compare between different models, and analyze how frequently each estimator leads to drawing incorrect conclusions about which of two models performs best. We find that the two biased estimators lead to the fewest incorrect conclusions, which hints at the importance of minimizing variance and MSE.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6.

A Comparative Analysis of Unsupervised Language Adaptation Methods\n\n*From Search Query: comparative architecture analysis*\n\n*Gil Rocha, Henrique Lopes Cardoso*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that adversarial training methods are more suitable when the source and target language datasets contain other variations in content besides the language shift, and sentence encoder alignment methods are very effective and can yield scores on the target language that are close to the source language scores.\n\n**Abstract:** To overcome the lack of annotated resources in less-resourced languages, recent approaches have been proposed to perform unsupervised language adaptation. In this paper, we explore three recent proposals: Adversarial Training, Sentence Encoder Alignment and Shared-Private Architecture. We highlight the differences of these approaches in terms of unlabeled data requirements and capability to overcome additional domain shift in the data. A comparative analysis in two different tasks is conducted, namely on Sentiment Classification and Natural Language Inference. We show that adversarial training methods are more suitable when the source and target language datasets contain other variations in content besides the language shift. Otherwise, sentence encoder alignment methods are very effective and can yield scores on the target language that are close to the source language scores.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8.

Specifically, we build a series of simple yet insightful neural baselines to deal with E2E-ABSA. The experimental results show that even with a simple linear classification layer, our BERT-based architecture can outperform state-of-the-art works. Besides, we also standardize the comparative study by consistently utilizing a hold-out validation dataset for model selection, which is largely ignored by previous works.

A Comparative Analysis of Task-Agnostic Distillation Methods for Compressing Transformer Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: comparative architecture analysis*\n\n*Takuma Udagawa, Aashka Trivedi, Michele Merler, Bishwaranjan Bhattacharjee*\n\n**TL;DR:** Overall, it is shown that MHA transfer based on MiniLMv2 is generally the best option for distillation and explains the potential reasons behind its success, while HS transfer remains as a competitive baseline, especially under a sophisticated layer mapping strategy, while OD transfer consistently lags behind other approaches.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have become a vital component in modern NLP, achieving state of the art performance in a variety of tasks. However, they are often inefficient for real-world deployment due to their expensive inference costs. Knowledge distillation is a promising technique to improve their efficiency while retaining most of their effectiveness. In this paper, we reproduce, compare and analyze several representative methods for task-agnostic (general-purpose) distillation of Transformer language models. Our target of study includes Output Distribution (OD) transfer, Hidden State (HS) transfer with various layer mapping strategies, and Multi-Head Attention (MHA) transfer based on MiniLMv2. Through our extensive experiments, we study the effectiveness of each method for various student architectures in both monolingual (English) and multilingual settings. Overall, we show that MHA transfer based on MiniLMv2 is generally the best option for distillation and explain the potential reasons behind its success. Moreover, we show that HS transfer remains as a competitive baseline, especially under a sophisticated layer mapping strategy, while OD transfer consistently lags behind other approaches. Findings from this study helped us deploy efficient yet effective student models for latency-critical applications.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 1 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Lambek vs. Lambek: Functorial Vector Space Semantics and String Diagrams\n  for Lambek Calculus\n\n*From Search Query: empirical validation methods*\n\n*Bob Coecke, Edward Grefenstette, Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh*\n\n**Abstract:** The Distributional Compositional Categorical (DisCoCat) model is a\nmathematical framework that provides compositional semantics for meanings of\nnatural language sentences. It consists of a computational procedure for\nconstructing meanings of sentences, given their grammatical structure in terms\nof compositional type-logic, and given the empirically derived meanings of\ntheir words. For the particular case that the meaning of words is modelled\nwithin a distributional vector space model, its experimental predictions,\nderived from real large scale data, have outperformed other empirically\nvalidated methods that could build vectors for a full sentence. This success\ncan be attributed to a conceptually motivated mathematical underpinning, by\nintegrating qualitative compositional type-logic and quantitative modelling of\nmeaning within a category-theoretic mathematical framework.\n  The type-logic used in the DisCoCat model is Lambek's pregroup grammar.\nPregroup types form a posetal compact closed category, which can be passed, in\na functorial manner, on to the compact closed structure of vector spaces,\nlinear maps and tensor product. The diagrammatic versions of the equational\nreasoning in compact closed categories can be interpreted as the flow of word\nmeanings within sentences. Pregroups simplify Lambek's previous type-logic, the\nLambek calculus, which has been extensively used to formalise and reason about\nvarious linguistic phenomena. The apparent reliance of the DisCoCat on\npregroups has been seen as a shortcoming. This paper addresses this concern, by\npointing out that one may as well realise a functorial passage from the\noriginal type-logic of Lambek, a monoidal bi-closed category, to vector spaces,\nor to any other model of meaning organised within a monoidal bi-closed\ncategory. The corresponding string diagram calculus, due to Baez and Stay, now\ndepicts the flow of word meanings.\n\n**Published:** 2013-02-02T15:57:26Z  (*Updated: 2013-02-02T15:57:26Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Hardware-efficient entangled measurements for variational quantum algorithms\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficiency implementation*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Variational algorithms have received significant attention in recent years due to their potential to solve practical problems using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. A fundamental step of these algorithms is the evaluation of the expected value of Hamiltonians, and hence efficient schemes to perform this task are required. The standard approach employs local measurements of Pauli operators and requires a large number of circuits. An alternative is to make use of entangled measurements, which might introduce additional gates between physically disconnected qubits that harm the performance. As a solution to this problem, we propose hardware-efficient entangled measurements (HEEM), that is, measurements that permit only entanglement between physically connected qubits. We show that this strategy enhances the evaluation of molecular Hamiltonians in NISQ devices by reducing the number of circuits required without increasing their depth. We provide quantitative metrics of how this approach offers better results than local measurements and arbitrarily entangled measurements. We estimate the ground-state energy of the H$_2$O molecule with classical simulators and quantum hardware using the variational quantum eigensolver with HEEM.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-14\n\n\n\n#### 2. HELP: Hardware-Adaptive Efficient Latency Prediction for NAS via Meta-Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficiency implementation*\n\n*Sung Ju Hwang, Song Chong, Sewoong Lee, Hayeon Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** For deployment, neural architecture search should be hardware-aware, in order to satisfy the device-specific constraints (e.g., memory usage, latency and energy consumption) and enhance the model efficiency. Existing methods on hardware-aware NAS collect a large number of samples (e.g., accuracy and latency) from a target device, either builds a lookup table or a latency estimator. However, such approach is impractical in real-world scenarios as there exist numerous devices with different hardware specifications, and collecting samples from such a large number of devices will require prohibitive computational and monetary cost. To overcome such limitations, we propose Hardware-adaptive Efficient Latency Predictor (HELP), which formulates the device-specific latency estimation problem as a meta-learning problem, such that we can estimate the latency of a model's performance for a given task on an unseen device with a few samples. To this end, we introduce novel hardware embeddings to embed any devices considering them as black-box functions that output latencies, and meta-learn the hardware-adaptive latency predictor in a device-dependent manner, using the hardware embeddings. We validate the proposed HELP for its latency estimation performance on unseen platforms, on which it achieves high estimation performance with as few as 10 measurement samples, outperforming all relevant baselines. We also validate end-to-end NAS frameworks using HELP against ones without it, and show that it largely reduces the total time cost of the base NAS method, in latency-constrained settings.

MobileOne: An Improved One millisecond Mobile Backbone\n\n*From Search Query: comparative architecture analysis*\n\n*Anurag Ranjan, Oncel Tuzel, Jeff Zhu, James Gabriel, Pavan Kumar Anasosalu Vasu*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient neural network backbones for mobile devices are often optimized for metrics such as FLOPs or parameter count. However, these metrics may not correlate well with latency of the network when deployed on a mobile device. Therefore, we perform extensive analysis of different metrics by deploying several mobile-friendly networks on a mobile device. We identify and analyze architectural and optimization bottlenecks in recent efficient neural networks and provide ways to mitigate these bottlenecks. To this end, we design an efficient backbone MobileOne, with variants achieving an inference time under 1 ms on an iPhone12 with 75.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. We show that MobileOne achieves state-of-the-art performance within the efficient architectures while being many times faster on mobile. Our best model obtains similar performance on ImageNet as MobileFormer while being 38x faster. Our model obtains 2.3% better top-1 accuracy on ImageNet than EfficientNet at similar latency. Furthermore, we show that our model generalizes to multiple tasks - image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation with significant improvements in latency and accuracy as compared to existing efficient architectures when deployed on a mobile device.

PP-StructureV2: A Stronger Document Analysis System\n\n*From Search Query: comparative architecture analysis*\n\n*dianhai yu, Xiaoguang Hu, Yi Liu, Lingfeng Zhu, Yuning Du, Mengtao An, Jun Zhou, Ruoyu Guo, Chenxia Li*\n\n**Abstract:** A large amount of document data exists in unstructured form such as raw images without any text information. Designing a practical document image analysis system is a meaningful but challenging task. In previous work, we proposed an intelligent document analysis system PP-Structure. In order to further upgrade the function and performance of PP-Structure, we propose PP-StructureV2 in this work, which contains two subsystems: Layout Information Extraction and Key Information Extraction. Firstly, we integrate Image Direction Correction module and Layout Restoration module to enhance the functionality of the system. Secondly, 8 practical strategies are utilized in PP-StructureV2 for better performance. For Layout Analysis model, we introduce ultra light-weight detector PP-PicoDet and knowledge distillation algorithm FGD for model lightweighting, which increased the inference speed by 11 times with comparable mAP. For Table Recognition model, we utilize PP-LCNet, CSP-PAN and SLAHead to optimize the backbone module, feature fusion module and decoding module, respectively, which improved the table structure accuracy by 6\\% with comparable inference speed. For Key Information Extraction model, we introduce VI-LayoutXLM which is a visual-feature independent LayoutXLM architecture, TB-YX sorting algorithm and U-DML knowledge distillation algorithm, which brought 2.8\\% and 9.1\\% improvement respectively on the Hmean of Semantic Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction tasks.

Techniques such as hierarchical attention mechanisms and sparse attention can reduce memory usage. For example, the \"Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model\" mentioned in the analysis note uses a multi-resolution framework that could be optimized for memory efficiency by focusing on key components and reducing redundant computations.\n\n### Efficient Temporal Processing\n- Adaptive normalization techniques, such as those described in \"Adaptive Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series\" (SAN), can be adapted for temporal processing in autoregressive models. SAN's approach to normalizing time series data at the local temporal slice level can be applied to improve the efficiency of temporal processing in language models.\n- Temporal Effective Batch Normalization (TEBN) can also be integrated to smooth the optimization landscape, which can lead to more efficient training and inference processes.\n\n### Adaptive Component Coordination\n- The \"AdaBelief Optimizer\" and \"SAPE: Spatially-Adaptive Progressive Encoding\" provide insights into adaptive component coordination. These methods can be adapted to manage the interactions between different components in an autoregressive model, ensuring stable and efficient training.\n\n## Empirical Validation Approaches\n\n### Training Stability Metrics\n- Empirical validation of training stability can be achieved by monitoring metrics such as gradient norms, loss functions, and convergence rates. The \"AdaBelief Optimizer\" paper provides a framework for evaluating the stability of adaptive optimization methods, which can be applied to autoregressive models.\n\n### Temporal Normalization Effectiveness\n- To validate the effectiveness of temporal normalization, metrics such as the smoothness of the optimization landscape and the stability of the training process can be used. The \"Temporal Effective Batch Normalization\" paper offers a method to evaluate the impact of temporal normalization on the training process.\n\n### Hierarchical Processing Efficiency\n- Evaluating the efficiency of hierarchical processing involves measuring the computational overhead and the accuracy of the model. The \"SpeechFormer++\" paper provides a framework for evaluating hierarchical processing efficiency in speech models, which can be adapted for language models.\n\n## Comparative Analysis Frameworks\n\n### Architecture Benchmarking\n- Benchmarking different architectures involves comparing performance metrics such as perplexity, accuracy, and computational efficiency. A comparative analysis framework should include standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols to ensure fair comparisons. For example, comparing the performance of models using different normalization techniques (e.g., SAN vs. TEBN) can provide valuable insights into their relative efficiencies.\n\n### Performance Metrics\n- Key performance metrics for autoregressive language models include perplexity, accuracy on downstream tasks, and robustness to variant inputs. A comparative analysis should include these metrics to evaluate the overall performance of different architectures. The analysis note provides a summary of how different models perform on these metrics, which can be used as a starting point for comparison[Analysis Note].\n\n### Resource Utilization\n- Evaluating resource utilization involves measuring the memory, computational power, and energy consumption of different models. Techniques such as model pruning, quantization, and efficient attention mechanisms can be compared to determine their impact on resource utilization. For instance, the use of sparse attention mechanisms can significantly reduce memory and computational requirements.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n### Agile and CI/CD Practices\n- Adopting Agile methodologies and Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) practices, as discussed in the context of hardware development, can also be beneficial for software development, including autoregressive language models. These practices can help in early detection of design flaws, integration issues, and performance inefficiencies, thereby improving the overall development process.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop more efficient, stable, and performant autoregressive language models that are optimized for both hardware and software aspects.\n",

You Only Scan Once: Efficient Multi-dimension Sequential Modeling with LightNet (Avg.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

ChordMixer: A Scalable Neural Attention Model for Sequences with Different Lengths (Avg. Score: 0.47)\n\n*Ruslan Khalitov, Tong Yu, Lei Cheng, Zhirong Yang*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple neural network building block called ChordMixer which can model the attention for long sequences with variable lengths, and substantially outperforms other neural attention models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sequential data naturally have different lengths in many domains, with some very long sequences. As an important modeling tool, neural attention should capture long-range interaction in such sequences. However, most existing neural attention models admit only short sequences, or they have to employ chunking or padding to enforce a constant input length. Here we propose a simple neural network building block called ChordMixer which can model the attention for long sequences with variable lengths. Each ChordMixer block consists of a position-wise rotation layer without learnable parameters and an element-wise MLP layer. Repeatedly applying such blocks forms an effective network backbone that mixes the input signals towards the learning targets. We have tested ChordMixer on the synthetic adding problem, long document classification, and DNA sequence-based taxonomy classification. The experiment results show that our method substantially outperforms other neural attention models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), volume 30, 2017.

Score: 0.40)\n\n*Ali Behrouz, Michele Santacatterina, Ramin Zabih*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 12  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have mainly relied on Transformers due to their data dependency and ability to learn at scale. The attention module in these architectures, however, exhibits quadratic time and space in input size, limiting their scalability for long-sequence modeling. Despite recent attempts to design efficient and effective architecture backbone for multi-dimensional data, such as images and multivariate time series, existing models are either data independent, or fail to allow inter- and intra-dimension communication. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), and more specifically Selective State Space Models, with efficient hardware-aware implementation, have shown promising potential for long sequence modeling. Motivated by the success of SSMs, we present MambaMixer, a new architecture with data-dependent weights that uses a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels, called Selective Token and Channel Mixer. MambaMixer connects selective mixers using a weighted averaging mechanism, allowing layers to have direct access to early features. As a proof of concept, we design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Time Series MambaMixer (TSM2) architectures based on the MambaMixer block and explore their performance in various vision and time series forecasting tasks. Our results underline the importance of selective mixing across both tokens and channels. In ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, ViM2 achieves competitive performance with well-established vision models and outperforms SSM-based vision models. In time series forecasting, TSM2 achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating significantly improved computational cost. These results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/35 (Score: 0.40)*\n\n```\nMartin, E. and Cundy, C.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

Current innovations, including State Space Models, were initially celebrated for surpassing Transformer performance on language modeling tasks. However, these models have revealed deficiencies in essential In-Context Learning capabilities - a domain where the Transformer traditionally shines. The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field. In our work, we present a singular, elegant alteration to the Based kernel that amplifies its In-Context Learning abilities evaluated with the Multi-Query Associative Recall task and overall language modeling process, as demonstrated on the Pile dataset.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/25 (Score: 0.24)*\n\n```\nDaniel Y.

Temporal Effective Batch Normalization in Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: temporal normalization neural networks*\n\n*Chaoteng Duan, Jianhao Ding, Shiyan Chen, Zhaofei Yu, Tiejun Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results show that SNNs with TEBN outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer time-steps, and achieve better robustness to hyper-parameters than other normalizations.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising in neuromorphic hardware owing to utilizing spatio-temporal information and sparse event-driven signal processing. However, it is challenging to train SNNs due to the non-differentiable nature of the binary firing function. The surrogate gradients alleviate the training problem and make SNNs obtain comparable performance as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with the same structure. Unfortunately, batch normalization, contributing to the success of ANNs, does not play a prominent role in SNNs because of the additional temporal dimension. To this end, we propose an effective normalization method called temporal effective batch normalization (TEBN). By rescaling the presynaptic inputs with different weights at every time-step, temporal distributions become smoother and uniform. Theoretical analysis shows that TEBN can be viewed as a smoother of SNN\u2019s optimization landscape and could help stabilize the gradient norm. Experimental results on both static and neuromorphic datasets show that SNNs with TEBN outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer time-steps, and achieve better robustness to hyper-parameters than other normalizations.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 64  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 2.

Dynamic Normalization and Relay for Video Action Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: temporal normalization neural networks*\n\n*Dongqi Cai, Anbang Yao, Yurong Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Dynamic Normalization and Relay (DNR), an improved normalization design, is presented, to augment the spatial-temporal representation learning of any deep action recognition model, adapting to small batch size training settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been the dominant model for video action recognition. Due to the huge memory and compute demand, popular action recognition networks need to be trained with small batch sizes, which makes learning discriminative spatial-temporal representations for videos become a challenging problem. In this paper, we present Dynamic Normalization and Relay (DNR), an improved normalization design, to augment the spatial-temporal representation learning of any deep action recognition model, adapting to small batch size training settings. We observe that state-of-the-art action recognition networks usually apply the same normalization parameters to all video data, and ignore the dependencies of the estimated normalization parameters between neighboring frames (at the same layer) and between neighboring layers (with all frames of a video clip). Inspired by this, DNR introduces two dynamic normalization relay modules to explore the potentials of cross-temporal and cross-layer feature distribution dependencies for estimating accurate layer-wise normalization parameters. These two DNR modules are instantiated as a light-weight recurrent structure conditioned on the current input features, and the normalization parameters estimated from the neighboring frames based features at the same layer or from the whole video clip based features at the preceding layers. We \ufb01rst plug DNR into prevailing 2D CNN backbones and test its performance on public action recognition datasets including Kinetics and Something-Something. Experimental results show that DNR brings large performance improvements to the baselines, achieving over 4.4 % absolute margins in top-1 accuracy without training bells and whistles. More experiments on 3D backbones and several latest 2D spatial-temporal networks further validate its effectiveness.

QuIP: 2-Bit Quantization of Large Language Models With Guarantees\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive vector quantization language models*\n\n*Jerry Chee, Yaohui Cai, Volodymyr Kuleshov, Chris De Sa*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces quantization with incoherence processing (QuIP), a new method based on the insight that quantization benefits from incoherent weight and Hessian matrices that improves several existing quantization algorithms and yields the first LLM quantization methods that produce viable results using only two bits per weight.\n\n**Abstract:** This work studies post-training parameter quantization in large language models (LLMs). We introduce quantization with incoherence processing (QuIP), a new method based on the insight that quantization benefits from incoherent weight and Hessian matrices, i.e., from the weights being even in magnitude and the directions in which it is important to round them accurately being unaligned with the coordinate axes. QuIP consists of two steps: (1) an adaptive rounding procedure minimizing a quadratic proxy objective; (2) efficient pre- and post-processing that ensures weight and Hessian incoherence via multiplication by random orthogonal matrices. We complement QuIP with the first theoretical analysis for an LLM-scale quantization algorithm, and show that our theory also applies to an existing method, OPTQ. Empirically, we find that our incoherence preprocessing improves several existing quantization algorithms and yields the first LLM quantization methods that produce viable results using only two bits per weight.

QLLM: Accurate and Efficient Low-Bitwidth Quantization for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive vector quantization language models*\n\n*Jing Liu, Ruihao Gong, Xiuying Wei, Zhiwei Dong, Jianfei Cai, Bohan Zhuang*\n\n**TL;DR:** QLLM is proposed, an accurate and efficient low-bitwidth PTQ method designed for LLMs that introduces an adaptive channel reassembly technique that reallocates the magnitude of outliers to other channels, thereby mitigating their impact on the quantization range.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in NLP, but their demands hinder their widespread deployment. While Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) offers a solution, its extensive training costs make Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) a more practical approach for LLMs. In existing studies, activation outliers in particular channels are identified as the bottleneck to PTQ accuracy. They propose to transform the magnitudes from activations to weights, which however offers limited alleviation or suffers from unstable gradients, resulting in a severe performance drop at low-bitwidth. In this paper, we propose QLLM, an accurate and efficient low-bitwidth PTQ method designed for LLMs. QLLM introduces an adaptive channel reassembly technique that reallocates the magnitude of outliers to other channels, thereby mitigating their impact on the quantization range. This is achieved by channel disassembly and channel assembly, which first breaks down the outlier channels into several sub-channels to ensure a more balanced distribution of activation magnitudes. Then similar channels are merged to maintain the original channel number for efficiency. Additionally, an adaptive strategy is designed to autonomously determine the optimal number of sub-channels for channel disassembly. To further compensate for the performance loss caused by quantization, we propose an efficient tuning method that only learns a small number of low-rank weights while freezing the pre-trained quantized model. After training, these low-rank parameters can be fused into the frozen weights without affecting inference. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2 show that QLLM can obtain accurate quantized models efficiently. For example, QLLM quantizes the 4-bit LLaMA-2-70B within 10 hours on a single A100-80G GPU, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art method by 7.89% on the average accuracy across five zero-shot tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 38  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 6. Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive vector quantization language models*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Wei Zhang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper compress generative PLMs by quantization with comparable performance with the full-precision models, and proposes a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing size of generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have greatly increased the demand for model compression. Despite various methods to compress BERT or its variants, there are few attempts to compress generative PLMs, and the underlying difficulty remains unclear. In this paper, we compress generative PLMs by quantization. We find that previous quantization methods fail on generative tasks due to the homogeneous word embeddings caused by reduced capacity and the varied distribution of weights. Correspondingly, we propose a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules. Empirical results on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compression methods on generative PLMs by a clear margin. With comparable performance with the full-precision models, we achieve 14.4x and 13.4x compression rate on GPT-2 and BART, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 89  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 7.

He, Zhouchen Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is elucidated that spiking time can function as an additional dimension to encode relation properties via a neural-generalized path formulation in SNNs, revealing that SNNs are proficient in executing (knowledge) graph reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are investigated as biologically inspired models of neural computation, distinguished by their computational capability and energy efficiency due to precise spiking times and sparse spikes with event-driven computation. A significant question is how SNNs can emulate human-like graph-based reasoning of concepts and relations, especially leveraging the temporal domain optimally. This paper reveals that SNNs, when amalgamated with synaptic delay and temporal coding, are proficient in executing (knowledge) graph reasoning. It is elucidated that spiking time can function as an additional dimension to encode relation properties via a neural-generalized path formulation. Empirical results highlight the efficacy of temporal delay in relation processing and showcase exemplary performance in diverse graph reasoning tasks. The spiking model is theoretically estimated to achieve $20\\times$ energy savings compared to non-spiking counterparts, deepening insights into the capabilities and potential of biologically inspired SNNs for efficient reasoning.

Meirom, Shie Mannor, Gal Chechik*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a new supervised learning setup called Em Cascade, where an agent is shown a video of a physically simulated dynamic scene, and is asked to intervene and trigger a cascade of events, such that the system reaches a \"counterfactual\"goal.\n\n**Abstract:** Reasoning and interacting with dynamic environments is a fundamental problem in AI, but it becomes extremely challenging when actions can trigger cascades of cross-dependent events. We introduce a new supervised learning setup called {\\em Cascade} where an agent is shown a video of a physically simulated dynamic scene, and is asked to intervene and trigger a cascade of events, such that the system reaches a\"counterfactual\"goal. For instance, the agent may be asked to\"Make the blue ball hit the red one, by pushing the green ball\". The agent intervention is drawn from a continuous space, and cascades of events makes the dynamics highly non-linear. We combine semantic tree search with an event-driven forward model and devise an algorithm that learns to search in semantic trees in continuous spaces. We demonstrate that our approach learns to effectively follow instructions to intervene in previously unseen complex scenes. It can also reason about alternative outcomes, when provided an observed cascade of events.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. LLMs Learn Task Heuristics from Demonstrations: A Heuristic-Driven Prompting Strategy for Document-Level Event Argument Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: event-driven processing efficiency*\n\n*Hanzhang Zhou, Junlang Qian, Zijian Feng, Hui Lu, Zixiao Zhu, Kezhi Mao*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Heuristic-Driven Link-of-Analogy prompting is introduced, which enables LLMs to process new situations by drawing analogies to known situations, enhancing their performance on unseen classes beyond limited ICL examples.\n\n**Abstract:** In this study, we investigate in-context learning (ICL) in document-level event argument extraction (EAE) to alleviate the dependency on large-scale labeled data for this task. We introduce the Heuristic-Driven Link-of-Analogy (HD-LoA) prompting to address the challenge of example selection and to develop a prompting strategy tailored for EAE. Specifically, we hypothesize and validate that LLMs learn task-specific heuristics from demonstrations via ICL. Building upon this hypothesis, we introduce an explicit heuristic-driven demonstration construction approach, which transforms the haphazard example selection process into a methodical method that emphasizes task heuristics. Additionally, inspired by the analogical reasoning of human, we propose the link-of-analogy prompting, which enables LLMs to process new situations by drawing analogies to known situations, enhancing their performance on unseen classes beyond limited ICL examples. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing prompting methods and few-shot supervised learning methods on document-level EAE datasets. Additionally, the HD-LoA prompting shows effectiveness in diverse tasks like sentiment analysis and natural language inference, demonstrating its broad adaptability.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Temporal FiLM: Capturing Long-Range Sequence Dependencies with Feature-Wise Modulations.\n\n*From Search Query: temporal normalization neural networks*\n\n*Zayd Enam, Sawyer Birnbaum, Volodymyr Kuleshov, Pang Wei W. Koh, Stefano Ermon*\n\n**Abstract:** Learning representations that accurately capture long-range dependencies in sequential inputs --- including text, audio, and genomic data --- is a key problem in deep learning. Feed-forward convolutional models capture only feature interactions within finite receptive fields while recurrent architectures can be slow and difficult to train due to vanishing gradients. Here, we propose Temporal Feature-Wise Linear Modulation (TFiLM) --- a novel architectural component inspired by adaptive batch normalization and its extensions --- that uses a recurrent neural network to alter the activations of a convolutional model. This approach expands the receptive field of convolutional sequence models with minimal computational overhead. Empirically, we find that TFiLM significantly improves the learning speed and accuracy of feed-forward neural networks on a range of generative and discriminative learning tasks, including text classification and audio super-resolution.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2019-12\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. Real-Time Super-Resolution System of 4K-Video Based on Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: temporal normalization neural networks*\n\n*He Li, Yongming Tang, Changjun Song, Chengcheng Wang, Yanpeng Cao*\n\n**Abstract:** Video super-resolution (VSR) technology excels in reconstructing low-quality video, avoiding unpleasant blur effect caused by interpolation-based algorithms. However, vast computation complexity and memory occupation hampers the edge of deplorability and the runtime inference in real-life applications, especially for large-scale VSR task. This paper explores the possibility of real-time VSR system and designs an efficient and generic VSR network, termed EGVSR. The proposed EGVSR is based on spatio-temporal adversarial learning for temporal coherence. In order to pursue faster VSR processing ability up to 4K resolution, this paper tries to choose lightweight network structure and efficient upsampling method to reduce the computation required by EGVSR network under the guarantee of high visual quality. Besides, we implement the batch normalization computation fusion, convolutional acceleration algorithm and other neural network acceleration techniques on the actual hardware platform to optimize the inference process of EGVSR network. Finally, our EGVSR achieves the real-time processing capacity of 4K@29.61FPS. Compared with TecoGAN, the most advanced VSR network at present, we achieve 85.04% reduction of computation density and 7.92x performance speedups. In terms of visual quality, the proposed EGVSR tops the list of most metrics (such as LPIPS, tOF, tLP, etc.) on the public test dataset Vid4 and surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in overall performance score.

SNAC: Multi-Scale Neural Audio Codec\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive vector quantization language models*\n\n*Luca A. Lanzend\u00f6rfer, Florian Gr\u00f6tschla, Hubert Siuzdak*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural audio codecs have recently gained popularity because they can represent audio signals with high fidelity at very low bitrates, making it feasible to use language modeling approaches for audio generation and understanding. Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) has become the standard technique for neural audio compression using a cascade of VQ codebooks. This paper proposes the Multi-Scale Neural Audio Codec, a simple extension of RVQ where the quantizers can operate at different temporal resolutions. By applying a hierarchy of quantizers at variable frame rates, the codec adapts to the audio structure across multiple timescales. This leads to more efficient compression, as demonstrated by extensive objective and subjective evaluations.

PiSSA: Principal Singular Values and Singular Vectors Adaptation of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive vector quantization language models*\n\n*Muhan Zhang, Zhaohui Wang, Fanxu Meng*\n\n**Abstract:** To parameter-efficiently fine-tune (PEFT) large language models (LLMs), the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method approximates the model changes $\\Delta W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ through the product of two matrices $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times r}$ and $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times n}$, where $r \\ll \\min(m, n)$, $A$ is initialized with Gaussian noise, and $B$ with zeros. LoRA freezes the original model $W$ and updates the \"Noise & Zero\" adapter, which may lead to slow convergence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Principal Singular values and Singular vectors Adaptation (PiSSA). PiSSA shares the same architecture as LoRA, but initializes the adaptor matrices $A$ and $B$ with the principal components of the original matrix $W$, and put the remaining components into a residual matrix $W^{res} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ which is frozen during fine-tuning. Compared to LoRA, PiSSA updates the principal components while freezing the \"residual\" parts, allowing faster convergence and enhanced performance. Comparative experiments of PiSSA and LoRA across 12 different models, ranging from 184M to 70B, encompassing 5 NLG and 8 NLU tasks, reveal that PiSSA consistently outperforms LoRA under identical experimental setups. On the GSM8K benchmark, Mistral-7B fine-tuned with PiSSA achieves an accuracy of 72.86%, surpassing LoRA's 67.7% by 5.16%. Due to the same architecture, PiSSA is also compatible with quantization to further reduce the memory requirement of fine-tuning. Compared to QLoRA, QPiSSA (PiSSA with 4-bit quantization) exhibits smaller quantization errors in the initial stages. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3-70B on GSM8K, QPiSSA attains an accuracy of 86.05%, exceeding the performances of QLoRA at 81.73%. Leveraging a fast SVD technique, PiSSA can be initialized in only a few seconds, presenting a negligible cost for transitioning from LoRA to PiSSA.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-03\n\n\n\n#### 5. SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: event-driven processing efficiency*\n\n*Guoqi Li, Jason K. Eshraghian, Qihang Zhao, Rui-Jie Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations.

FederatedScope: A Flexible Federated Learning Platform for Heterogeneity\n\n*From Search Query: event-driven processing efficiency*\n\n*Daoyuan Chen, Dawei Gao, Jingren Zhou, Bolin Ding, Yaliang Li, Weirui Kuang, Liuyi Yao, Zhen Wang, Yuexiang Xie*\n\n**Abstract:** Although remarkable progress has been made by existing federated learning (FL) platforms to provide infrastructures for development, these platforms may not well tackle the challenges brought by various types of heterogeneity, including the heterogeneity in participants' local data, resources, behaviors and learning goals. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel FL platform, named FederatedScope, which employs an event-driven architecture to provide users with great flexibility to independently describe the behaviors of different participants. Such a design makes it easy for users to describe participants with various local training processes, learning goals and backends, and coordinate them into an FL course with synchronous or asynchronous training strategies. Towards an easy-to-use and flexible platform, FederatedScope enables rich types of plug-in operations and components for efficient further development, and we have implemented several important components to better help users with privacy protection, attack simulation and auto-tuning. We have released FederatedScope at https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope to promote academic research and industrial deployment of federated learning in a wide range of scenarios.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on the areas of temporal normalization, adaptive vector quantization, and event-driven processing, here are some key points and relevant information from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n### Temporal Normalization Techniques in Neural Networks\n\n#### Methods for Stabilizing Training with Temporal Dependencies\n- Temporal normalization is crucial for stabilizing training in models with temporal dependencies. In the context of spatio-temporal data, models like the Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (STGCN) use temporal convolution modules to analyze temporal patterns. These modules often employ techniques such as dilated convolution to extend the receptive field without increasing parameters, which helps in stabilizing the training process by capturing wider temporal information efficiently.\n\n#### Applications in Language Models\n- While the provided sources do not directly discuss temporal normalization in language models, the concept can be adapted from other domains. For instance, techniques like batch normalization can be modified for temporal data. Research on \"Temporal Effective Batch Normalization\" in spiking neural networks suggests that similar approaches could be applied to language models to normalize temporal dependencies, improving training stability and feature representation.\n\n#### Impact on Gradient Flow and Training Stability\n- Temporal normalization can significantly impact gradient flow by reducing the vanishing gradient problem, which is common in models with long-term dependencies. Adaptive smoothing mechanisms, as mentioned in the initial analysis, can help stabilize gradients during training. This is similar to the \"Adaptive Smoothing Gradient Learning\" approach in spiking neural networks, which could be adapted for language models to enhance training stability.\n\n### Adaptive Vector Quantization Approaches\n\n#### Integration of Temporal Information\n- Adaptive vector quantization can be integrated with temporal information by using dynamic compression ratios based on the temporal importance of the data. This approach is not directly discussed in the provided sources but is a logical extension of existing quantization methods. The idea is to compress less important temporal features more aggressively while preserving critical information, similar to how dynamic compression is used in other contexts.\n\n#### Dynamic Compression Ratios and Model Quality\n- Dynamic compression ratios can help maintain model quality while reducing memory usage. This involves adjusting the compression level based on the temporal significance of the data. For example, in the context of anomaly detection, models like STGCN_Hyper use multi-scale feature extraction to capture features at different temporal scales, which could be adapted to include dynamic compression.\n\n### Event-Driven Processing Architectures\n\n#### Hierarchical Compression and State Management\n- Hierarchical compression can be implemented using event-driven processing architectures. For instance, the STGCN_Hyper model uses a hypergraph-based structure to capture high-order correlations and multi-hop relationships, which can be seen as a form of hierarchical compression. This approach efficiently manages states by dynamically learning inter-variable relationships during training.\n\n#### Scaling with Sequence Length\n- Event-driven processing architectures can scale well with sequence length by using techniques such as multi-scale temporal convolution networks (TCNs). These networks can extract short-term, mid-term, and long-term feature patterns in parallel, ensuring training efficiency and scalability with longer sequences.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Temporal Encoding and Normalization**: The use of temporal encoding and normalization, as seen in the ovarian cancer survival prediction model, involves sequentially ordering and normalizing time series data. This approach can be adapted to language models to improve the handling of temporal dependencies.\n\n- **Multi-Component Adaptive Systems**: The integration of multiple adaptive components, such as combining RNNs and GNNs, can enhance training stability and model performance. This is evident in models that blend temporal modeling with relational context, improving the feature representation and prediction accuracy.\n\n- **Gradient Flow Optimization**: Techniques like adaptive smoothing and temporal-aware training can optimize gradient flow, reducing the risk of vanishing gradients and improving overall training stability. These methods can be crucial in autoregressive language models where long-term dependencies are common.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, the researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that leverages temporal normalization for stable training, adaptive vector quantization for efficient compression, and event-driven processing for scalable and efficient handling of sequence data.\n",

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2. MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.13)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/38 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.12)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Caglar Gulcehre, KyungHyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

Large Language Models as Commonsense Knowledge for Large-Scale Task Planning\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale temporal processing language models*\n\n*Zirui Zhao, W. Lee, David Hsu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper shows that LLMs provide a commonsense model of the world in addition to a policy that acts on it, and proposes a new LLM-MCTS algorithm, which outperforms both MCTS alone and policies induced by LLMs by a wide margin.\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale task planning is a major challenge. Recent work exploits large language models (LLMs) directly as a policy and shows surprisingly interesting results. This paper shows that LLMs provide a commonsense model of the world in addition to a policy that acts on it. The world model and the policy can be combined in a search algorithm, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), to scale up task planning. In our new LLM-MCTS algorithm, the LLM-induced world model provides a commonsense prior belief for MCTS to achieve effective reasoning; the LLM-induced policy acts as a heuristic to guide the search, vastly improving search efficiency. Experiments show that LLM-MCTS outperforms both MCTS alone and policies induced by LLMs (GPT2 and GPT3.5) by a wide margin, for complex, novel tasks. Further experiments and analyses on multiple tasks -- multiplication, multi-hop travel planning, object rearrangement -- suggest minimum description length (MDL) as a general guiding principle: if the description length of the world model is substantially smaller than that of the policy, using LLM as a world model for model-based planning is likely better than using LLM solely as a policy.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 117  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2.

Scaling the diversity and quality of such data, although straightforward, stands a great chance of leading to improved performance. This paper aims to improve the upper bound of open-source models further. We first provide a systematically designed, diverse, informative, large-scale dataset of instructional conversations, UltraChat, which does not involve human queries. Our objective is to capture the breadth of interactions that a human might have with an AI assistant and employs a comprehensive framework to generate multi-turn conversation iteratively. UltraChat contains 1.5 million high-quality multi-turn dialogues and covers a wide range of topics and instructions. Our statistical analysis of UltraChat reveals its superiority in various key metrics, including scale, average length, diversity, coherence, etc., solidifying its position as a leading open-source dataset. Building upon UltraChat, we fine-tune a LLaMA model to create a powerful conversational model, UltraLLaMA. Our evaluations indicate that UltraLLaMA consistently outperforms other open-source models, including Vicuna, the previously recognized state-of-the-art open-source model.

COST-EFF: Collaborative Optimization of Spatial and Temporal Efficiency with Slenderized Multi-exit Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale temporal processing language models*\n\n*Bowen Shen, Zheng Lin, Yuanxin Liu, Zhengxiao Liu, Lei Wang, Weiping Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a collaborative optimization for PLMs that integrates static model compression and dynamic inference acceleration, and proposes a joint training approach that calibrates slenderization and preserves contributive structures to each exit instead of only the final layer.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) mostly suffer from excessive overhead despite their advanced capacity. For resource-constrained devices, there is an urgent need for a spatially and temporally efficient model which retains the major capacity of PLMs. However, existing statically compressed models are unaware of the diverse complexities between input instances, potentially resulting in redundancy and inadequacy for simple and complex inputs. Also, miniature models with early exiting encounter challenges in the trade-off between making predictions and serving the deeper layers. Motivated by such considerations, we propose a collaborative optimization for PLMs that integrates static model compression and dynamic inference acceleration. Specifically, the PLM is slenderized in width while the depth remains intact, complementing layer-wise early exiting to speed up inference dynamically. To address the trade-off of early exiting, we propose a joint training approach that calibrates slenderization and preserves contributive structures to each exit instead of only the final layer. Experiments are conducted on GLUE benchmark and the results verify the Pareto optimality of our approach at high compression and acceleration rate with 1/8 parameters and 1/19 FLOPs of BERT.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Temporal Dynamic Quantization for Diffusion Models\n\n*From Search Query: temporal quantization efficiency*\n\n*Junhyuk So, Jungwon Lee, Daehyun Ahn, Hyungjun Kim, Eunhyeok Park*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel quantization method that dynamically adjusts the quantization interval based on time step information, significantly improving output quality and has no computational overhead during inference.\n\n**Abstract:** The diffusion model has gained popularity in vision applications due to its remarkable generative performance and versatility. However, high storage and computation demands, resulting from the model size and iterative generation, hinder its use on mobile devices. Existing quantization techniques struggle to maintain performance even in 8-bit precision due to the diffusion model's unique property of temporal variation in activation. We introduce a novel quantization method that dynamically adjusts the quantization interval based on time step information, significantly improving output quality. Unlike conventional dynamic quantization techniques, our approach has no computational overhead during inference and is compatible with both post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT). Our extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in output quality with the quantized diffusion model across various datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 5.

This paper focuses on post-training quantization (PTQ) in LLMs, specifically 4-bit weight and 8-bit activation (W4A8) quantization, to enhance computational efficiency -- a topic less explored compared to weight-only quantization. We present two innovative techniques: activation-quantization-aware scaling (AQAS) and sequence-length-aware calibration (SLAC) to enhance PTQ by considering the combined effects on weights and activations and aligning calibration sequence lengths to target tasks. Moreover, we introduce dINT, a hybrid data format combining integer and denormal representations, to address the underflow issue in W4A8 quantization, where small values are rounded to zero. Through rigorous evaluations of LLMs, including OPT and LLaMA, we demonstrate that our techniques significantly boost task accuracies to levels comparable with full-precision models. By developing arithmetic units compatible with dINT, we further confirm that our methods yield a 2$\\times$ hardware efficiency improvement compared to 8-bit integer MAC unit.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. OmniQuant: Omnidirectionally Calibrated Quantization for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: temporal quantization efficiency*\n\n*Wenqi Shao, Mengzhao Chen, Zhaoyang Zhang, Peng Xu, Lirui Zhao, Zhiqiang Li, Kaipeng Zhang, Peng Gao, Y. Qiao, Ping Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** An Omnidirectionally calibrated Quantization technique for LLMs is introduced, which achieves good performance in diverse quantization settings while maintaining the computational efficiency of PTQ by efficiently optimizing various quantization parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. However, their practical deployment is hindered by their immense memory and computation requirements. Although recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are effective in reducing memory footprint and improving the computational efficiency of LLM, they hand-craft quantization parameters, leading to low performance, especially in extremely low-bit quantization. To tackle this issue, we introduce an Omnidirectionally calibrated Quantization (\\textbf{OmniQuant}) technique for LLMs, which achieves good performance in diverse quantization settings while maintaining the computational efficiency of PTQ by efficiently optimizing various quantization parameters. OmniQuant comprises two innovative components including Learnable Weight Clipping (LWC) and Learnable Equivalent Transformation (LET). LWC modulates the extreme values of weights by optimizing the clipping threshold. Meanwhile, LET tackles activation outliers by shifting the challenge of quantization from activations to weights. Operating within a differentiable framework using block-wise error minimization, OmniQuant can optimize the quantization process efficiently for both weight-only and weight-activation quantization. For instance, the LLaMA-2 model family size 7-70B can be processed with OmniQuant on a single A100-40G GPU within 1-16 hours using 128 samples. Extensive experiments validate OmniQuant's superior performance across diverse quantization configurations such as W4A4 (4-bit weight, 4-bit activation), W6A6, W4A16, W3A16, and W2A16. Additionally, OmniQuant demonstrates effectiveness in instruction-tuned models and delivers notable improvements in inference speed and memory reduction on real devices.

Improving Inference for Neural Image Compression\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression neural networks*\n\n*Yibo Yang, Robert Bamler, S.

State-of-the-art methods build on hierarchical variational autoencoders (VAEs) and learn inference networks to predict a compressible latent representation of each data point. Drawing on the variational inference perspective on compression, we identify three approximation gaps which limit performance in the conventional approach: (i) an amortization gap, (ii) a discretization gap, and (iii) a marginalization gap. We propose improvements to each of these three shortcomings based on ideas related to iterative inference, stochastic annealing for discrete optimization, and bits-back coding, resulting in the first application of bits-back coding to lossy compression. In our experiments, which include extensive baseline comparisons and ablation studies, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on lossy image compression using an established VAE architecture, by changing only the inference method.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 107  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 8.

Anaraki, Lei Guo*\n\n**TL;DR:** C2FAR is the first method to simultaneously handle discrete and continuous series of arbitrary scale and distribution shape, which enables a variety of time series use cases, including anomaly detection, interpolation, and compression.\n\n**Abstract:** We present coarse-to-fine autoregressive networks (C2FAR), a method for modeling the probability distribution of univariate, numeric random variables. C2FAR generates a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine discretization of a variable autoregressively; progressively finer intervals of support are generated from a sequence of binned distributions, where each distribution is conditioned on previously-generated coarser intervals. Unlike prior (flat) binned distributions, C2FAR can represent values with exponentially higher precision, for only a linear increase in complexity. We use C2FAR for probabilistic forecasting via a recurrent neural network, thus modeling time series autoregressively in both space and time. C2FAR is the first method to simultaneously handle discrete and continuous series of arbitrary scale and distribution shape. This flexibility enables a variety of time series use cases, including anomaly detection, interpolation, and compression. C2FAR achieves improvements over the state-of-the-art on several benchmark forecasting datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Spatio-Temporal Side Tuning Pre-trained Foundation Models for Video-based Pedestrian Attribute Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale temporal processing language models*\n\n*Yonghong Tian, YaoWei Wang, Bo Jiang, Futian Wang, Jun Zhu, Jiandong Jin, Qian Zhu, Xiao Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Existing pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) algorithms are mainly developed based on a static image, however, the performance is unreliable in challenging scenarios, such as heavy occlusion, motion blur, etc. In this work, we propose to understand human attributes using video frames that can fully use temporal information by fine-tuning a pre-trained multi-modal foundation model efficiently. Specifically, we formulate the video-based PAR as a vision-language fusion problem and adopt a pre-trained foundation model CLIP to extract the visual features. More importantly, we propose a novel spatiotemporal side-tuning strategy to achieve parameter-efficient optimization of the pre-trained vision foundation model. To better utilize the semantic information, we take the full attribute list that needs to be recognized as another input and transform the attribute words/phrases into the corresponding sentence via split, expand, and prompt operations. Then, the text encoder of CLIP is utilized for embedding processed attribute descriptions. The averaged visual tokens and text tokens are concatenated and fed into a fusion Transformer for multi-modal interactive learning. The enhanced tokens will be fed into a classification head for pedestrian attribute prediction. Extensive experiments on two large-scale video-based PAR datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Fine-tuned CLIP Models are Efficient Video Learners\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale temporal processing language models*\n\n*Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Salman Khan, Muhammad Maaz, Muhammad Uzair Khattak, Hanoona Rasheed*\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale multi-modal training with image-text pairs imparts strong generalization to CLIP model. Since training on a similar scale for videos is infeasible, recent approaches focus on the effective transfer of image-based CLIP to the video domain. In this pursuit, new parametric modules are added to learn temporal information and inter-frame relationships which require meticulous design efforts. Furthermore, when the resulting models are learned on videos, they tend to overfit on the given task distribution and lack in generalization aspect. This begs the following question: How to effectively transfer image-level CLIP representations to videos? In this work, we show that a simple Video Fine-tuned CLIP (ViFi-CLIP) baseline is generally sufficient to bridge the domain gap from images to videos. Our qualitative analysis illustrates that the frame-level processing from CLIP image-encoder followed by feature pooling and similarity matching with corresponding text embeddings helps in implicitly modeling the temporal cues within ViFi-CLIP. Such fine-tuning helps the model to focus on scene dynamics, moving objects and inter-object relationships. For low-data regimes where full fine-tuning is not viable, we propose a `bridge and prompt' approach that first uses fine-tuning to bridge the domain gap and then learns prompts on language and vision side to adapt CLIP representations. We extensively evaluate this simple yet strong baseline on zero-shot, base-to-novel generalization, few-shot and fully supervised settings across five video benchmarks.

SNAC: Multi-Scale Neural Audio Codec\n\n*From Search Query: temporal quantization efficiency*\n\n*Luca A. Lanzend\u00f6rfer, Florian Gr\u00f6tschla, Hubert Siuzdak*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural audio codecs have recently gained popularity because they can represent audio signals with high fidelity at very low bitrates, making it feasible to use language modeling approaches for audio generation and understanding. Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) has become the standard technique for neural audio compression using a cascade of VQ codebooks. This paper proposes the Multi-Scale Neural Audio Codec, a simple extension of RVQ where the quantizers can operate at different temporal resolutions. By applying a hierarchy of quantizers at variable frame rates, the codec adapts to the audio structure across multiple timescales. This leads to more efficient compression, as demonstrated by extensive objective and subjective evaluations.

LVAC: Learned Volumetric Attribute Compression for Point Clouds using Coordinate Based Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression neural networks*\n\n*George Toderici, Nick Johnston, Sung Jin Hwang, Philip A. Chou, Berivan Isik*\n\n**Abstract:** We consider the attributes of a point cloud as samples of a vector-valued volumetric function at discrete positions. To compress the attributes given the positions, we compress the parameters of the volumetric function. We model the volumetric function by tiling space into blocks, and representing the function over each block by shifts of a coordinate-based, or implicit, neural network. Inputs to the network include both spatial coordinates and a latent vector per block. We represent the latent vectors using coefficients of the region-adaptive hierarchical transform (RAHT) used in the MPEG geometry-based point cloud codec G-PCC. The coefficients, which are highly compressible, are rate-distortion optimized by back-propagation through a rate-distortion Lagrangian loss in an auto-decoder configuration. The result outperforms RAHT by 2--4 dB. This is the first work to compress volumetric functions represented by local coordinate-based neural networks. As such, we expect it to be applicable beyond point clouds, for example to compression of high-resolution neural radiance fields.\n\n**Published:** 2021-11-17\n\n\n\n#### 6.

Empirically, we achieve\nthe new state-of-the-art on all metrics (including human evaluation) on the\nCNN/Daily Mail dataset, as well as significantly higher abstractiveness scores.\nMoreover, by first operating at the sentence-level and then the word-level, we\nenable parallel decoding of our neural generative model that results in\nsubstantially faster (10-20x) inference speed as well as 4x faster training\nconvergence than previous long-paragraph encoder-decoder models. We also\ndemonstrate the generalization of our model on the test-only DUC-2002 dataset,\nwhere we achieve higher scores than a state-of-the-art model.\n\n**Conference:** fast-abstractive-summarization-with-reinforce-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-05-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on multi-scale temporal processing, joint temporal normalization and quantization, and hierarchical compression, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Multi-scale Temporal Processing in Language Models\n\n### Hierarchical Temporal Feature Extraction\n- The concept of hierarchical temporal feature extraction can be inspired by models like the Enhanced Multi-Temporal Network (E-MTN) used in video analysis. This model incorporates pyramid dilated convolution (PDC) blocks and transformer encoder blocks to extract multi-scale temporal features, which could be adapted for language models to handle different time scales effectively.\n\n### Scale-Adaptive Processing Mechanisms\n- Models like PatchTST, which segment time series data into patches to capture long-term dependencies efficiently, can be a reference point. This approach allows for the handling of long-range temporal patterns, which is crucial for language models dealing with long sequences. The patch-based method can be integrated with self-attention mechanisms to enhance the model's ability to capture multi-scale temporal information.\n\n### Integration with Attention Mechanisms\n- Attention mechanisms, such as those used in hierarchical time series modeling, can dynamically weight different time series components. This approach can be applied to language models to focus on relevant temporal information at different scales. Dual-axis attention, which disentangles seasonality and trend directly within the latent space, could be a valuable technique for adapting to changing patterns in language data.\n\n## Joint Temporal Normalization and Quantization Approaches\n\n### Dynamic Precision Allocation\n- The concept of adaptive quantization, as seen in QuIP and QLLM, can be extended to include temporal awareness. This involves dynamically allocating precision based on the temporal importance of the data, which could help in maintaining model quality while reducing memory usage[Analysis Note].\n\n### Temporal-Aware Compression Techniques\n- Temporal Effective Batch Normalization (TEBN) can be integrated with quantization techniques to stabilize the training process and improve gradient flow. This approach smooths the temporal distributions, making the optimization landscape more stable. Channel-wise adaptation techniques from QLLM could also be valuable for temporal-aware compression[Analysis Note].\n\n### Stability Analysis of Quantized Temporal Models\n- Theoretical analysis of TEBN shows its potential as a smoother of the optimization landscape, which could help in stabilizing the gradient norm. Similar stability analysis should be conducted for quantized temporal models to ensure they maintain performance and stability[Analysis Note].\n\n## Hierarchical Compression Techniques\n\n### Memory-Efficient State Representations\n- Event-driven architectures like SpikeGPT demonstrate significant efficiency gains by leveraging sparse, event-driven activations. This can be combined with hierarchical state management to reduce computational overhead and memory usage. Hierarchical event processing can help manage long sequences efficiently[Analysis Note].\n\n### Multi-Level Feature Compression\n- The use of multi-level feature compression, as seen in the enhanced MTN model, can be applied to language models. This involves using techniques like pyramid dilated convolution and transformer encoder blocks to compress features at multiple scales, ensuring that important temporal information is retained while reducing memory usage.\n\n### Adaptive State Management\n- Adaptive state management can be achieved by integrating techniques like dynamic precision allocation and temporal-aware compression. This allows the model to adaptively manage its state based on the temporal importance of the data, ensuring efficient use of resources while maintaining performance[Analysis Note].\n\nIn summary, to improve autoregressive language models, researchers can explore:\n\n- **Hierarchical temporal feature extraction** using techniques like PDC blocks and transformer encoder blocks.\n- **Scale-adaptive processing mechanisms** inspired by models like PatchTST.\n- **Integration with attention mechanisms** to dynamically weight temporal information.\n- **Temporal-aware quantization** combining TEBN with adaptive quantization methods.\n- **Hierarchical compression** using event-driven architectures and multi-level feature compression.\n- **Adaptive state management** to efficiently manage model states based on temporal importance.\n\nThese approaches can help in achieving better performance, efficiency, and scalability in autoregressive language models.\n",

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers (Ring Attention), which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/23 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 2023.

Originally designed for continuous signals, SSMs have shown superior performance on a plethora of tasks, in vision and audio; however, SSMs still lag Transformer performance in Language Modeling tasks. In this work, we propose a hybrid layer named Block-State Transformer (BST), that internally combines an SSM sublayer for long-range contextualization, and a Block Transformer sublayer for short-term representation of sequences. We study three different, and completely parallelizable, variants that integrate SSMs and block-wise attention. We show that our model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language modeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences. In addition, the Block-State Transformer demonstrates more than tenfold increase in speed at the layer level compared to the Block-Recurrent Transformer when model parallelization is employed.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/28 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/1805.04623, 2018.

Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/46 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32, 2019 .

However, computing the attention matrix, which is their key component, has quadratic complexity with respect to the sequence length, thus making them prohibitively expensive for large sequences. To address this, we propose clustered attention, which instead of computing the attention for every query, groups queries into clusters and computes attention just for the centroids. To further improve this approximation, we use the computed clusters to identify the keys with the highest attention per query and compute the exact key/query dot products. This results in a model with linear complexity with respect to the sequence length for a fixed number of clusters. We evaluate our approach on two automatic speech recognition datasets and show that our model consistently outperforms vanilla transformers for a given computational budget. Finally, we demonstrate that our model can approximate arbitrarily complex attention distributions with a minimal number of clusters by approximating a pretrained BERT model on GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks with only 25 clusters and no loss in performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/27 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\n517-520.

SAPE: Spatially-Adaptive Progressive Encoding for Neural Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive systems*\n\n*Amir Hertz, Or Perel, R. Giryes, O. Sorkine-Hornung, D. Cohen-Or*\n\n**TL;DR:** A spatially adaptive progressive encoding scheme for input signals of MLP networks is presented, which enables them to better fit a wide range of frequencies without sacrificing training stability or requiring any domain specific preprocessing.\n\n**Abstract:** Multilayer-perceptrons (MLP) are known to struggle with learning functions of high-frequencies, and in particular cases with wide frequency bands. We present a spatially adaptive progressive encoding (SAPE) scheme for input signals of MLP networks, which enables them to better fit a wide range of frequencies without sacrificing training stability or requiring any domain specific preprocessing. SAPE gradually unmasks signal components with increasing frequencies as a function of time and space. The progressive exposure of frequencies is monitored by a feedback loop throughout the neural optimization process, allowing changes to propagate at different rates among local spatial portions of the signal space. We demonstrate the advantage of SAPE on a variety of domains and applications, including regression of low dimensional signals and images, representation learning of occupancy networks, and a geometric task of mesh transfer between 3D shapes.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 60  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 2.

This defense ability, however, is challenged in this paper. We identify a novel threat model named stability attack, which aims to hinder robust availability by slightly manipulating the training data. Under this threat, we show that adversarial training using a conventional defense budget $\\epsilon$ provably fails to provide test robustness in a simple statistical setting, where the non-robust features of the training data can be reinforced by $\\epsilon$-bounded perturbation. Further, we analyze the necessity of enlarging the defense budget to counter stability attacks. Finally, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that stability attacks are harmful on benchmark datasets, and thus the adaptive defense is necessary to maintain robustness.

AdaBelief Optimizer: Adapting Stepsizes by the Belief in Observed Gradients\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive systems*\n\n*Juntang Zhuang, Tommy M. Tang, Yifan Ding, S. Tatikonda, N. Dvornek, X. Papademetris, J. Duncan*\n\n**TL;DR:** AdaBelief is proposed to simultaneously achieve three goals: fast convergence as in adaptive methods, good generalization as in SGD, and training stability; it outperforms other methods with fast convergence and high accuracy on image classification and language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** Most popular optimizers for deep learning can be broadly categorized as adaptive methods (e.g. Adam) and accelerated schemes (e.g. stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum). For many models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), adaptive methods typically converge faster but generalize worse compared to SGD; for complex settings such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), adaptive methods are typically the default because of their stability.We propose AdaBelief to simultaneously achieve three goals: fast convergence as in adaptive methods, good generalization as in SGD, and training stability. The intuition for AdaBelief is to adapt the stepsize according to the \"belief\" in the current gradient direction. Viewing the exponential moving average (EMA) of the noisy gradient as the prediction of the gradient at the next time step, if the observed gradient greatly deviates from the prediction, we distrust the current observation and take a small step; if the observed gradient is close to the prediction, we trust it and take a large step. We validate AdaBelief in extensive experiments, showing that it outperforms other methods with fast convergence and high accuracy on image classification and language modeling. Specifically, on ImageNet, AdaBelief achieves comparable accuracy to SGD.

Adaptive Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting: A Temporal Slice Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: temporal normalization integration*\n\n*Zhiding Liu, Mingyue Cheng, Zhi Li, Zhenya Huang, Qi Liu, Yanhu Xie, Enhong Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel slice-level adaptive normalization scheme, referred to SAN, is proposed, which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization and could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning models have progressively advanced time series forecasting due to their powerful capacity in capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to make accurate predictions due to the existence of non-stationarity in real-world data, denoting the data distribution rapidly changes over time. To mitigate such a dilemma, several efforts have been conducted by reducing the non-stationarity with normalization operation. However, these methods typically overlook the distribution discrepancy between the input series and the horizon series, and assume that all time points within the same instance share the same statistical properties, which is too ideal and may lead to suboptimal relative improvements. To this end, we propose a novel slice-level adaptive normalization, referred to SAN , which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization. SAN includes two crucial designs. First, SAN tries to eliminate the non-stationarity of time series in units of a local temporal slice (i.e., sub-series) rather than a global instance. Second, SAN employs a slight network module to independently model the evolving trends of statistical properties of raw time series. Consequently, SAN could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data. We instantiate the proposed SAN on four widely used forecasting models and test their prediction results on benchmark datasets to evaluate its effectiveness. Also, we report some insightful findings to deeply analyze and understand our proposed SAN. We make our codes publicly available 2 .\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 5. Temporal Effective Batch Normalization in Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: temporal normalization integration*\n\n*Chaoteng Duan, Jianhao Ding, Shiyan Chen, Zhaofei Yu, Tiejun Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results show that SNNs with TEBN outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer time-steps, and achieve better robustness to hyper-parameters than other normalizations.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising in neuromorphic hardware owing to utilizing spatio-temporal information and sparse event-driven signal processing. However, it is challenging to train SNNs due to the non-differentiable nature of the binary firing function. The surrogate gradients alleviate the training problem and make SNNs obtain comparable performance as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with the same structure. Unfortunately, batch normalization, contributing to the success of ANNs, does not play a prominent role in SNNs because of the additional temporal dimension. To this end, we propose an effective normalization method called temporal effective batch normalization (TEBN). By rescaling the presynaptic inputs with different weights at every time-step, temporal distributions become smoother and uniform. Theoretical analysis shows that TEBN can be viewed as a smoother of SNN\u2019s optimization landscape and could help stabilize the gradient norm. Experimental results on both static and neuromorphic datasets show that SNNs with TEBN outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer time-steps, and achieve better robustness to hyper-parameters than other normalizations.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 64  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 6. Integration-free Training for Spatio-temporal Multimodal Covariate Deep Kernel Point Processes\n\n*From Search Query: temporal normalization integration*\n\n*Yixuan Zhang, Quyu Kong, Feng Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** To address the intractable training procedure of DKMPP due to the non-integrable deep kernel, an integration-free method based on score matching is utilized, and efficiency is improved by adopting a scalable denoising score matching method.\n\n**Abstract:** In this study, we propose a novel deep spatio-temporal point process model, Deep Kernel Mixture Point Processes (DKMPP), that incorporates multimodal covariate information. DKMPP is an enhanced version of Deep Mixture Point Processes (DMPP), which uses a more flexible deep kernel to model complex relationships between events and covariate data, improving the model's expressiveness. To address the intractable training procedure of DKMPP due to the non-integrable deep kernel, we utilize an integration-free method based on score matching, and further improve efficiency by adopting a scalable denoising score matching method.

Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model for Realistic Image Deblurring\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing efficiency*\n\n*Zheng Chen, Yulun Zhang, Ding Liu, Bin Xia, Jinjin Gu, L. Kong, X. Yuan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff) is proposed, which designs the hierarchical integration module to fuse the prior into the regression-based model from multiple scales, enabling better generalization in complex blurry scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** Diffusion models (DMs) have recently been introduced in image deblurring and exhibited promising performance, particularly in terms of details reconstruction. However, the diffusion model requires a large number of inference iterations to recover the clean image from pure Gaussian noise, which consumes massive computational resources. Moreover, the distribution synthesized by the diffusion model is often misaligned with the target results, leading to restrictions in distortion-based metrics. To address the above issues, we propose the Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff), for realistic image deblurring. Specifically, we perform the DM in a highly compacted latent space to generate the prior feature for the deblurring process. The deblurring process is implemented by a regression-based method to obtain better distortion accuracy. Meanwhile, the highly compact latent space ensures the efficiency of the DM. Furthermore, we design the hierarchical integration module to fuse the prior into the regression-based model from multiple scales, enabling better generalization in complex blurry scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world blur datasets demonstrate that our HI-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

While this has been demonstrated empirically over time in a variety of tasks, theoretical results quantifying the ben-e\ufb01ts of such methods are still few and far between.

We show that, under reasonable assumptions, a model-based Thompson sampling-style HRL algorithm that exploits this structure is statistically ef\ufb01cient, as established through a \ufb01nite-time regret bound.

A Multi-Resolution Framework for U-Nets with Applications to Hierarchical VAEs\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing efficiency*\n\n*Fabian Falck, Christopher Williams, D. Danks, George Deligiannidis, C. Yau, Chris C. Holmes, A. Doucet, M. Willetts*\n\n**TL;DR:** A multi-resolution framework is formulated which identifies U-Nets as finite-dimensional truncations of models on an infinite-dimensional function space and identifies state-of-the-art hierarchical VAEs (HVAEs) as a type of two-step forward Euler discretisation of multi- resolution diffusion processes which flow from a point mass, introducing sampling instabilities.\n\n**Abstract:** U-Net architectures are ubiquitous in state-of-the-art deep learning, however their regularisation properties and relationship to wavelets are understudied. In this paper, we formulate a multi-resolution framework which identifies U-Nets as finite-dimensional truncations of models on an infinite-dimensional function space. We provide theoretical results which prove that average pooling corresponds to projection within the space of square-integrable functions and show that U-Nets with average pooling implicitly learn a Haar wavelet basis representation of the data. We then leverage our framework to identify state-of-the-art hierarchical VAEs (HVAEs), which have a U-Net architecture, as a type of two-step forward Euler discretisation of multi-resolution diffusion processes which flow from a point mass, introducing sampling instabilities. We also demonstrate that HVAEs learn a representation of time which allows for improved parameter efficiency through weight-sharing. We use this observation to achieve state-of-the-art HVAE performance with half the number of parameters of existing models, exploiting the properties of our continuous-time formulation.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. On-Device Training Under 256KB Memory\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive systems*\n\n*Song Han, Chuang Gan, Wei-Chen Wang, Wei-Ming Chen, Ligeng Zhu, Ji Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** On-device training enables the model to adapt to new data collected from the sensors by fine-tuning a pre-trained model. Users can benefit from customized AI models without having to transfer the data to the cloud, protecting the privacy. However, the training memory consumption is prohibitive for IoT devices that have tiny memory resources. We propose an algorithm-system co-design framework to make on-device training possible with only 256KB of memory. On-device training faces two unique challenges: (1) the quantized graphs of neural networks are hard to optimize due to low bit-precision and the lack of normalization; (2) the limited hardware resource does not allow full back-propagation. To cope with the optimization difficulty, we propose Quantization-Aware Scaling to calibrate the gradient scales and stabilize 8-bit quantized training. To reduce the memory footprint, we propose Sparse Update to skip the gradient computation of less important layers and sub-tensors. The algorithm innovation is implemented by a lightweight training system, Tiny Training Engine, which prunes the backward computation graph to support sparse updates and offload the runtime auto-differentiation to compile time. Our framework is the first solution to enable tiny on-device training of convolutional neural networks under 256KB SRAM and 1MB Flash without auxiliary memory, using less than 1/1000 of the memory of PyTorch and TensorFlow while matching the accuracy on tinyML application VWW. Our study enables IoT devices not only to perform inference but also to continuously adapt to new data for on-device lifelong learning.

Language and Noise Transfer in Speech Enhancement Generative Adversarial Network\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive systems*\n\n*Kang-Hun Ahn, Joan Serr\u00e0, Santiago Pascual, Antonio Bonafonte, Maruchan Park*\n\n**Abstract:** Speech enhancement deep learning systems usually require large amounts of\ntraining data to operate in broad conditions or real applications. This makes\nthe adaptability of those systems into new, low resource environments an\nimportant topic. In this work, we present the results of adapting a speech\nenhancement generative adversarial network by finetuning the generator with\nsmall amounts of data.

XceptionTime: A Novel Deep Architecture based on Depthwise Separable Convolutions for Hand Gesture Classification\n\n*From Search Query: temporal normalization integration*\n\n*Arash Mohammadi, Seyed Farokh Atashzar, Amir Asif, Soheil Zabihi, Elahe Rahimian*\n\n**Abstract:** Capitalizing on the need for addressing the existing challenges associated with gesture recognition via sparse multichannel surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals, the paper proposes a novel deep learning model, referred to as the XceptionTime architecture. The proposed innovative XceptionTime is designed by integration of depthwise separable convolutions, adaptive average pooling, and a novel non-linear normalization technique. At the heart of the proposed architecture is several XceptionTime modules concatenated in series fashion designed to capture both temporal and spatial information-bearing contents of the sparse multichannel sEMG signals without the need for data augmentation and/or manual design of feature extraction. In addition, through integration of adaptive average pooling, Conv1D, and the non-linear normalization approach, XceptionTime is less prone to overfitting, more robust to temporal translation of the input, and more importantly is independent from the input window size. Finally, by utilizing the depthwise separable convolutions, the XceptionTime network has far fewer parameters resulting in a less complex network. The performance of XceptionTime is tested on a sub Ninapro dataset, DB1, and the results showed a superior performance in comparison to any existing counterparts. In this regard, 5:71% accuracy improvement, on a window size 200ms, is reported in this paper, for the first time.\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-09\n\n\n\n#### 4. GaitSet: Cross-view Gait Recognition through Utilizing Gait as a Deep Set\n\n*From Search Query: temporal normalization integration*\n\n*Jianfeng Feng, Junping Zhang, Yiwei He, Kun Wang, Hanqing Chao*\n\n**Abstract:** Gait is a unique biometric feature that can be recognized at a distance; thus, it has broad applications in crime prevention, forensic identification, and social security. To portray a gait, existing gait recognition methods utilize either a gait template which makes it difficult to preserve temporal information, or a gait sequence that maintains unnecessary sequential constraints and thus loses the flexibility of gait recognition. In this paper, we present a novel perspective that utilizes gait as a deep set, which means that a set of gait frames are integrated by a global-local fused deep network inspired by the way our left- and right-hemisphere processes information to learn information that can be used in identification. Based on this deep set perspective, our method is immune to frame permutations, and can naturally integrate frames from different videos that have been acquired under different scenarios, such as diverse viewing angles, different clothes, or different item-carrying conditions. Experiments show that under normal walking conditions, our single-model method achieves an average rank-1 accuracy of 96.1% on the CASIA-B gait dataset and an accuracy of 87.9% on the OU-MVLP gait dataset. Under various complex scenarios, our model also exhibits a high level of robustness. It achieves accuracies of 90.8% and 70.3% on CASIA-B under bag-carrying and coat-wearing walking conditions respectively, significantly outperforming the best existing methods. Moreover, the proposed method maintains a satisfactory accuracy even when only small numbers of frames are available in the test samples; for example, it achieves 85.0% on CASIA-B even when using only 7 frames.

SpeechFormer++: A Hierarchical Efficient Framework for Paralinguistic Speech Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing efficiency*\n\n*Lan Du, Jianxin Pang, Xiangmin Xu, Xiaofen Xing, Weidong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Paralinguistic speech processing is important in addressing many issues, such as sentiment and neurocognitive disorder analyses. Recently, Transformer has achieved remarkable success in the natural language processing field and has demonstrated its adaptation to speech. However, previous works on Transformer in the speech field have not incorporated the properties of speech, leaving the full potential of Transformer unexplored. In this paper, we consider the characteristics of speech and propose a general structure-based framework, called SpeechFormer++, for paralinguistic speech processing. More concretely, following the component relationship in the speech signal, we design a unit encoder to model the intra- and inter-unit information (i.e., frames, phones, and words) efficiently. According to the hierarchical relationship, we utilize merging blocks to generate features at different granularities, which is consistent with the structural pattern in the speech signal. Moreover, a word encoder is introduced to integrate word-grained features into each unit encoder, which effectively balances fine-grained and coarse-grained information. SpeechFormer++ is evaluated on the speech emotion recognition (IEMOCAP & MELD), depression classification (DAIC-WOZ) and Alzheimer's disease detection (Pitt) tasks. The results show that SpeechFormer++ outperforms the standard Transformer while greatly reducing the computational cost. Furthermore, it delivers superior results compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-27\n\n\n\n#### 6. Efficient Sparse Coding using Hierarchical Riemannian Pursuit\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing efficiency*\n\n*Songfu Cai, Vincent Lau, Ye Xue*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse coding is a class of unsupervised methods for learning a sparse representation of the input data in the form of a linear combination of a dictionary and a sparse code. This learning framework has led to state-of-the-art results in various image and video processing tasks. However, classical methods learn the dictionary and the sparse code based on alternating optimizations, usually without theoretical guarantees for either optimality or convergence due to non-convexity of the problem. Recent works on sparse coding with a complete dictionary provide strong theoretical guarantees thanks to the development of the non-convex optimization. However, initial non-convex approaches learn the dictionary in the sparse coding problem sequentially in an atom-by-atom manner, which leads to a long execution time. More recent works seek to directly learn the entire dictionary at once, which substantially reduces the execution time. However, the associated recovery performance is degraded with a finite number of data samples. In this paper, we propose an efficient sparse coding scheme with a two-stage optimization. The proposed scheme leverages the global and local Riemannian geometry of the two-stage optimization problem and facilitates fast implementation for superb dictionary recovery performance by a finite number of samples without atom-by-atom calculation. We further prove that, with high probability, the proposed scheme can exactly recover any atom in the target dictionary with a finite number of samples if it is adopted to recover one atom of the dictionary. An application on wireless sensor data compression is also proposed. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on training stability, integration of temporal normalization, and efficient hierarchical processing, here are some key insights and references that can be useful:\n\n## Training Stability in Systems with Multiple Adaptive Components\n\n### Gradient Flow Optimization and Multi-Component Coordination\n- For training stability in systems with multiple adaptive components, methods like adaptive learning rate optimization are crucial. Techniques such as AdaGrad, RMSprop, and Adam adjust the learning rate based on historical gradients, which can improve training stability.\n- The paper on \"Self-Supervised Meta-Learning for All-Layer DNN-Based Adaptive Control\" discusses a framework that pretrains a DNN via self-supervised meta-learning and adapts the full DNN online using composite adaptation. This approach includes stability guarantees through careful design of control laws and adaptation laws, which can be relevant for ensuring stability in multi-component adaptive systems.\n\n### Stability Analysis Methods\n- The SSML-AC framework mentioned in the paper includes a stability analysis using Lyapunov analysis, which guarantees exponential stability of the closed-loop system. This approach can be adapted to ensure stability in autoregressive language models by designing similar stability guarantees for the training process.\n\n## Integration of Temporal Normalization with Other Techniques\n\n### Joint Optimization Approaches\n- Temporal normalization can be integrated with other techniques through joint optimization approaches. For instance, the \"Temporal Dynamic Quantization\" method adjusts quantization intervals based on time step information, which can be combined with temporal normalization to enhance model performance. This dynamic adjustment can be optimized jointly with other model parameters to improve overall efficiency and performance.\n\n### Hybrid Architectures\n- Hybrid architectures that combine different techniques, such as dense connections and multi-exit strategies, can benefit from integrating temporal normalization. For example, the \"DenseMamba\" model introduces dense hidden connections between layers, which can be combined with temporal normalization to enhance information flow and maintain efficiency.\n\n### Performance Impact Analysis\n- The integration of temporal normalization with quantization and other techniques should be analyzed for its performance impact. Studies like \"OmniQuant\" and \"Temporal Dynamic Quantization\" provide insights into how learnable parameters and dynamic adjustments can improve performance. Similar analyses can be conducted to evaluate the impact of temporal normalization on autoregressive language models.\n\n## Efficient Implementation of Hierarchical Processing\n\n### Memory Management Strategies\n- Efficient memory management is crucial for hierarchical processing. Techniques such as model pruning and quantization can help reduce memory usage. For example, \"OmniQuant\" introduces learnable weight clipping and equivalent transformation, which can be applied to hierarchical models to manage memory efficiently.\n\n### Parallel Processing Techniques\n- Parallel processing can significantly enhance the efficiency of hierarchical models. The \"DenseMamba\" model, for instance, retains training parallelizability and inference efficiency despite introducing dense connections between layers. Similar strategies can be applied to autoregressive language models to leverage parallel processing.\n\n### Hardware Optimization Methods\n- Hardware optimization methods, such as those used in \"SpikeGPT,\" can be highly effective. This model leverages neuromorphic hardware to process sparse, event-driven activations, reducing computational overhead. Similar hardware optimizations can be explored for autoregressive language models to improve efficiency.\n\nIn summary, to achieve the goal of improving autoregressive language model design, researchers can focus on:\n\n- **Training Stability**: Utilize adaptive learning rate methods and stability analysis techniques like those in the SSML-AC framework.\n- **Temporal Normalization Integration**: Combine temporal normalization with dynamic quantization and other techniques through joint optimization and hybrid architectures.\n- **Efficient Hierarchical Processing**: Implement efficient memory management, leverage parallel processing, and explore hardware optimization methods to enhance overall model efficiency and performance.\n",

Hierarchical Event Processor:\n```python\nclass HEProcessor(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, dim, levels=3):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.event_detector = EventDetector(dim)\n        self.compressors = nn.ModuleList([\n            AdaptiveCompressor(dim // (2**i))\n            for i in range(levels)\n        ])\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Detect events and importance\n        events, importance = self.event_detector(x)\n        \n        # Select compression level\n        level = self.select_level(importance)\n        \n        # Apply hierarchical compression\n        x_compressed = self.compressors[level](x)\n        return x_compressed, events\n```\n\n3. Adaptive Integration Controller:\n```python\nclass AIntegrationController(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, dim):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.smoother = AdaptiveGradientSmoother(dim)\n        self.stabilizer = StabilityController(dim)\n        \n    def forward(self, x, gate_output, quant_output):\n        # Smooth gradients\n        smooth_grads = self.smoother(x)\n        \n        # Stabilize integration\n        output = self.stabilizer(gate_output, quant_output, smooth_grads)\n        return output\n```\n\n### 4.2 Mathematical Formulation\n\n1.

Temporal Normalization:\n```python\ndef apply_temporal_norm(x, epsilon=1e-5):\n    # Compute temporal statistics\n    mean = x.mean(dim=1, keepdim=True)\n    var = x.var(dim=1, keepdim=True)\n    \n    # Apply normalization\n    x_norm = (x - mean) / torch.sqrt(var + epsilon)\n    return x_norm\n```\n\n2. Adaptive Quantization:\n```python\ndef quantize_adaptive(x, importance, codebooks):\n    # Select quantization level\n    level = select_quantization_level(importance)\n    \n    # Apply quantization\n    x_q = apply_quantization(x, codebooks[level])\n    return x_q\n```\n\n3. Event Processing:\n```python\ndef process_events(x, states):\n    # Detect events\n    events = detect_events(x)\n    \n    # Update states\n    new_states = update_states(states, events)\n    \n    # Compress states\n    compressed_states = compress_states(new_states)\n    return compressed_states\n```\n\n## 5.
