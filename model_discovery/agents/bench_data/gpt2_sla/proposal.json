Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Linear Attention with Tiling\n\nWe use a tiling technique to compute linear attention in a causal setting. Specifically, we first divide $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into two blocks by rows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\mathbf{X}=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\n\\mathbf{X}_{1} \\\\\n\\mathbf{X}_{2}\n\\end{array}\\right], \\mathbf{X}_{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d}, \\mathbf{X}_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(n-m) \\times d} \\\\\n\\mathbf{X} \\in\\{\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}\\}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThen, by unfolding Eq. 3, we get (note that $\\mathbf{k v}_{0}=0$ ):\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{v}_{s}=\\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{v}_{0}+\\sum_{j=1}^{s} \\mathbf{k}_{j} \\mathbf{v}_{j}^{\\top}, s=1, \\ldots, m \\\\\n& \\mathbf{o}_{s}^{\\top}=\\mathbf{q}_{s}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{v}_{s}=\\mathbf{q}_{s}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{v}_{0}+\\mathbf{q}_{s}^{\\top} \\sum_{j=1}^{s} \\mathbf{k}_{j} \\mathbf{v}_{j}^{\\top}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n```\nAlgorithm 3 Lightning Attention Forward Pass\n    Input: \\(\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}\\), block sizes \\(B\\). Divide \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) into \\(T=\\frac{n}{B}\\) blocks \\(\\mathbf{X}_{1}, \\mathbf{X}_{2}, \\ldots \\mathbf{X}_{T}\\) of size \\(B \\times d\\)\n    each, where \\(\\mathbf{X} \\in\\{\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}, \\mathbf{O}\\}\\). Initialize mask \\(\\mathbf{M} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B \\times B}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{M}_{t s}=1\\), if \\(t \\geq s\\), else 0 . Initialize \\(\\mathbf{K V}=0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}\\). for \\(t=1, \\ldots, T\\) do\n        Load \\(\\mathbf{Q}_{t}, \\mathbf{K}_{t}, \\mathbf{V}_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B \\times d}\\) from HBM to on-chip SRAM. On chip, compute \\(\\mathbf{O}_{\\text {intra }}=\\left[\\left(\\mathbf{Q}_{t} \\mathbf{K}_{t}^{\\top}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{M}\\right] \\mathbf{V}_{t}\\). On chip, compute \\(\\mathbf{O}_{\\text {inter }}=\\mathbf{Q}_{t}(\\mathbf{K V})\\). On chip, compute \\(\\mathbf{K V}=\\mathbf{K V}+\\mathbf{K}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}_{t}\\). Write \\(\\mathbf{O}_{t}=\\mathbf{O}_{\\text {intra }}+\\mathbf{O}_{\\text {inter }}\\) to HBM as the \\(t\\)-th block of \\(\\mathbf{O}\\). end for\n    Return O. ```\n\nIn block form, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{O}_{1} & =\\mathbf{Q}_{1} \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{v}_{0}+\\left[\\left(\\mathbf{Q}_{1} \\mathbf{K}_{1}^{\\top}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{M}\\right] \\mathbf{V}_{1} \\\\\n& \\triangleq \\mathbf{Q}_{1} \\mathbf{K} \\mathbf{V}_{0}+\\left[\\left(\\mathbf{Q}_{1} \\mathbf{K}_{1}^{\\top}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{M}\\right] \\mathbf{V}_{1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe above formula shows that the forward causal linear attention can be divided into two parts:\n\n- The computation within the block $\\left[\\left(\\mathbf{Q}_{1} \\mathbf{K}_{1}^{\\top}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{M}\\right] \\mathbf{V}_{1}$ (intra blocks) can use the Left Product;\n- The computation between blocks $\\mathbf{Q}_{1} \\mathbf{K V} \\mathbf{V}_{0}$ (inter blocks) can use the Right Product. It is worth noting that the second block can be computed using the same idea as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{v}_{m+t} & =\\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{v}_{m}+\\sum_{j=m+1}^{m+t} \\mathbf{k}_{j} \\mathbf{v}_{j}^{\\top}, t=1, \\ldots, n-m \\\\\n\\mathbf{o}_{m+t}^{\\top} & =\\mathbf{q}_{m+t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{v}_{m+t} \\\\\n\\mathbf{O}_{2} & =\\mathbf{Q}_{2} \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{v}_{m}+\\left[\\left(\\mathbf{Q}_{2} \\mathbf{K}_{2}^{\\top}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{M}\\right] \\mathbf{V}_{2} \\\\\n& \\triangleq \\mathbf{Q}_{2} \\mathbf{K} \\mathbf{V}_{1}+\\left[\\left(\\mathbf{Q}_{2} \\mathbf{K}_{2}^{\\top}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{M}\\right] \\mathbf{V}_{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that to compute the second block, we have to use $\\mathbf{K V} \\mathbf{V}_{1}=\\mathbf{k v}_{m}$, which can be computed by:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{K} \\mathbf{V}_{1}=\\mathbf{K} \\mathbf{V}_{0}+\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\mathbf{k}_{m} \\mathbf{v}_{m}^{\\top}=\\mathbf{K} \\mathbf{V}_{0}+\\mathbf{K}_{1}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}_{1}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{K V}_{0}=\\mathbf{k v}_{0}$. By using the above strategy to divide the matrix into multiple blocks, we obtain the Lightning Attention Forward Pass. More detailed derivation can be found in the Appendix C. For the backward propagation, according to (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), we can rewrite the process as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathbf{d q}_{t}^{\\top}=\\mathbf{d o}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k v}_{t}^{\\top}, \\mathbf{d k}_{t}^{\\top}=\\mathbf{v}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{v}_{t}^{\\top}, \\mathbf{d v}_{t}^{\\top}=\\mathbf{k}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{v}_{t} \\\\\n& \\mathbf{d k v} \\mathbf{v}_{n+1}=0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}, \\mathbf{d k v}_{t-1}=\\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{v}_{t}+\\mathbf{q}_{t-1} \\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{o}_{t-1}^{\\top}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the calculation of the backward propagation is consistent with the forward Eq. 4, and the Lightning Attention Backward Pass can also be obtained using the tiling technique.\n```\n\n#### 2.

TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanisms, tensor normalization, and inference acceleration and stabilization. Specifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique that accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces memory usage by a remarkable four times. To further enhance the performance of TransNormer, we leverage a gating mechanism for smooth training and a new tensor normalization scheme to accelerate the model, resulting in an impressive acceleration of over $20\\%$. Furthermore, we develop a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length, showcasing superior efficiency during both training and inference stages. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models, i.e., LLMs with 175B parameters. We validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of 385M, 1B, and 7B on our self-collected corpus.

Introduction\n\nThe Transformer architecture has achieved widespread adoption, particularly in the domain of large language models\n\n[^0]Preliminary work., Copyright 2024 by the author(s). (LLM) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Peng et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b) and multi-modal models (Li et al., 2022; 2023a; Liu et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b; Lu et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023a; Hao et al., 2024). However, its computational complexity grows quadratically with the length of the input sequence, making it challenging to model extremely long sequences. Unlimited sequence length stands out as a noteworthy aspect within the realm of LLM, attracting considerable attention from researchers who seek intelligent solutions. The potential applications of LLM with unlimited sequence length are diverse, encompassing extended conversations in various professional domains and handling a vast number of tokens in multimodal modeling tasks. In response to the quadratic complexity challenge, a promising resolution emerges in the form of linear attention. This method involves the elimination of the softmax operation and capitalizes on the associativity property of matrix products. Consequently, it significantly accelerates both training and inference procedures. To elaborate, linear attention reduces the computational complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) to compute the attention matrices, where $n$ represents the sequence length. This avenue holds substantial promise for augmenting the efficiency of transformer-style models across a broad spectrum of applications. It is important to note that the notable reduction in complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ in linear attention is only theoretical and may not directly translate to a proportional improvement in computational efficiency on hardware in practice. The realization of practical wall-clock speedup faces challenges, primarily stemming from two issues: 1). the dominance of memory access (I/O) on the GPU could impact the overall computation speed of attention. 2). the cumulative summation (cumsum) needed by the linear attention kernel trick prevents it from reaching its theoretical training speed in the causal setting. The first issue has been successfully addressed by Lightning Attention-1 (Qin et al., 2023b). In this paper, we introduce\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ae38c698417dafba3079g-02.jpg?height=521&width=1709&top_left_y=213&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 1. Speed Showdown: FlashAttention vs. Lightning Attention in Expanding Sequence Lengths and Model Sizes. The diagram above provides a comparative illustration of training speed, Token per GPU per Second (TGS) for LLaMA with FlashAttention-2, TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-1 and TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-2, implemented across three model sizes: 400M, 1B, and 3B from left to right. It is strikingly evident that Lightning Attention-2 manifests a consistent training speed irrespective of the increasing sequence length. Conversely, the other methods significantly decline training speed as the sequence length expands. Lightning Attention-2 to solve the second issue. The key idea is to leverage the concept of \"divide and conquer\" by separately handling the intra block and inter block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, for the intra blocks, we maintain the use of conventional attention computation mechanism to compute the product of QKV, while for the inter blocks, we employ the linear attention kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b). Tiling techniques are implemented in both forward and backward procedures to fully leverage GPU hardware capabilities. As a result, the Lightning Attention-2 can train LLMs with unlimited sequence length without extra cost ${ }^{1}$, as its computational speed remains constant with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of Lightning Attention-2 across a diverse range of sequence lengths to assess its accuracy and compare its computational speed and memory utilization with FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) and Lightning Attention-1.

Discussion A recent method, GLA (Yang et al., 2023) models sequences using linear attention with data-dependent decay. Its chunk-wise Block-Parallel Algorithm employs tiling and IO-aware concepts. However, unlike Lightning Attention-2, it uses parallel computations for each block, which leads to higher memory usage.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-09\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To address the researcher's goals of improving autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on causality preservation using tiling or block-wise processing, here are some key techniques and insights:\n\n## Causality Preservation Techniques\n\n### Lightning Attention-2 and Similar Models\n\nWhile the provided sources do not explicitly mention \"Lightning Attention-2,\" we can infer relevant techniques from similar models and general practices in efficient attention mechanisms.\n\n1. **Tiling Approach**:\n   - Models like the one described in the Movie Gen paper use temporal tiling to process large inputs efficiently. This involves dividing the input into tiles along the temporal dimension, processing each tile, and then stitching the results together. To maintain causality, each tile is processed sequentially, ensuring that the model does not attend to future tokens within the same tile or across tiles.\n\n2. **Hierarchical Processing**:\n   - Hierarchical attention mechanisms can be used to maintain causality. For example, a model might use a hierarchical structure where lower-level tiles or blocks are processed first, and their outputs are then used as inputs for higher-level processing. This ensures that the model respects the causal order of the input sequence.\n\n3. **Block-wise Processing with Causal Masks**:\n   - In autoregressive models, causal attention masks are used to enforce token causality. This means that each token can only attend to previous tokens in the sequence. When using block-wise processing, these causal masks are applied within each block to ensure that tokens within a block do not attend to future tokens. This approach is similar to the structured causal attention masks mentioned in the Movie Gen paper, which differ from full bi-directional attention.\n\n### Mathematical Formulations\n\n- **Causal Attention Masks**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d}} + M\\right)V\n  \\]\n  Here, \\(M\\) is the causal mask matrix where \\(M_{ij} = -\\infty\\) if \\(i > j\\) and \\(0\\) otherwise, ensuring that the model only attends to previous tokens.\n\n- **Tiling and Stitching**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Output} = \\text{Stitch}(\\text{Encode}(x_1), \\text{Encode}(x_2), \\ldots, \\text{Encode}(x_n))\n  \\]\n  Where \\(x_i\\) represents the \\(i\\)-th tile of the input sequence, and the stitching function combines the outputs of each tile while ensuring causal consistency.\n\n## Hardware Optimization and Efficiency Analysis\n\n### Modern Hardware-Specific Optimizations\n\n- **Mixed Precision Training**:\n  Using mixed precision (combining float16 and float32) can significantly reduce memory usage and increase computational speed without compromising model accuracy. This approach is particularly useful for large models and can be applied to attention mechanisms to reduce computational overhead.\n\n- **Efficient Inference Using Tiling**:\n  Similar to the Movie Gen approach, dividing the input into tiles and processing each tile separately can reduce memory requirements and make inference more efficient. This involves encoding and decoding each tile and then blending the results to remove boundary artifacts.\n\n### Techniques for Reducing Computational Overhead\n\n- **Efficient Attention Mechanisms**:\n  Techniques such as sparse attention or hierarchical attention can reduce the computational complexity of attention mechanisms. For example, sparse attention can limit the number of tokens that each token attends to, reducing the quadratic complexity of full attention.\n\n- **Differential Operations**:\n  Optimizing differential operations, such as using half precision for certain parts of the computation, can speed up training and inference. However, careful analysis is needed to ensure that such optimizations do not lead to gradient divergence or other stability issues.\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models that maintain causality while leveraging modern hardware optimizations. Future searches can delve deeper into training stability, regularization techniques, empirical validation, and differentiation from existing models to further enhance the model's performance.\n",

Introduction\n\nThe Transformer architecture has achieved widespread adoption, particularly in the domain of large language models\n\n[^0]Preliminary work., Copyright 2024 by the author(s). (LLM) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Peng et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b) and multi-modal models (Li et al., 2022; 2023a; Liu et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b; Lu et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023a; Hao et al., 2024). However, its computational complexity grows quadratically with the length of the input sequence, making it challenging to model extremely long sequences. Unlimited sequence length stands out as a noteworthy aspect within the realm of LLM, attracting considerable attention from researchers who seek intelligent solutions. The potential applications of LLM with unlimited sequence length are diverse, encompassing extended conversations in various professional domains and handling a vast number of tokens in multimodal modeling tasks. In response to the quadratic complexity challenge, a promising resolution emerges in the form of linear attention. This method involves the elimination of the softmax operation and capitalizes on the associativity property of matrix products. Consequently, it significantly accelerates both training and inference procedures. To elaborate, linear attention reduces the computational complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) to compute the attention matrices, where $n$ represents the sequence length. This avenue holds substantial promise for augmenting the efficiency of transformer-style models across a broad spectrum of applications. It is important to note that the notable reduction in complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ in linear attention is only theoretical and may not directly translate to a proportional improvement in computational efficiency on hardware in practice. The realization of practical wall-clock speedup faces challenges, primarily stemming from two issues: 1). the dominance of memory access (I/O) on the GPU could impact the overall computation speed of attention. 2). the cumulative summation (cumsum) needed by the linear attention kernel trick prevents it from reaching its theoretical training speed in the causal setting. The first issue has been successfully addressed by Lightning Attention-1 (Qin et al., 2023b).

The diagram above provides a comparative illustration of training speed, Token per GPU per Second (TGS) for LLaMA with FlashAttention-2, TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-1 and TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-2, implemented across three model sizes: 400M, 1B, and 3B from left to right. It is strikingly evident that Lightning Attention-2 manifests a consistent training speed irrespective of the increasing sequence length. Conversely, the other methods significantly decline training speed as the sequence length expands. Lightning Attention-2 to solve the second issue. The key idea is to leverage the concept of \"divide and conquer\" by separately handling the intra block and inter block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, for the intra blocks, we maintain the use of conventional attention computation mechanism to compute the product of QKV, while for the inter blocks, we employ the linear attention kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b). Tiling techniques are implemented in both forward and backward procedures to fully leverage GPU hardware capabilities. As a result, the Lightning Attention-2 can train LLMs with unlimited sequence length without extra cost ${ }^{1}$, as its computational speed remains constant with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of Lightning Attention-2 across a diverse range of sequence lengths to assess its accuracy and compare its computational speed and memory utilization with FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) and Lightning Attention-1. The findings indicate that Lightning Attention-2 exhibits a notable advantage in computational speed, attributed to its innovative intra-inter separation strategy. Additionally, Lightning Attention-2 demonstrates a reduced memory footprint compared to its counterparts without compromising performance. ## 2. Related Work\n\n### 2.1.

However, they usually suffer from degraded performances on various tasks and corpus. In this paper, we examine existing kernel-based linear transformers and identify two key issues that lead to such performance gaps: 1) unbounded gradients in the attention computation adversely impact the convergence of linear transformer models; 2) attention dilution which trivially distributes attention scores over long sequences while neglecting neighbouring structures. To address these issues, we first identify that the scaling of attention matrices is the devil in unbounded gradients, which turns out unnecessary in linear attention as we show theoretically and empirically. To this end, we propose a new linear attention that replaces the scaling operation with a normalization to stabilize gradients. For the issue of attention dilution, we leverage a diagonal attention to confine attention to only neighbouring tokens in early layers. Benefiting from the stable gradients and improved attention, our new linear transformer model, transNormer, demonstrates superior performance on text classification and language modeling tasks, as well as on the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark, surpassing vanilla transformer and existing linear variants by a clear margin while being significantly more space-time efficient.

Specifically, our network consists of two types of attention: DiagAttention for the early stage of the model and NORMATTENTION for the later stage. The former addresses the attention dilution issue and the later aims to stabilize training gradients. Note that by properly reshaping the inputs, the diagonal attention can be efficiently computed in linear space-time, thus preserving the overall linear complexity. ### 4.2 NormAtTEntion\n\nTable 1: Ablation of linear attention with scaling operation.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Codes and models are available at https://github. com/GATECH-EIC/Linearized-LLM. ## 1. Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 7 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: linear attention training stability regularization\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

In this work, we investigate the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers. In particular, we track the attention entropy for each attention head during the course of training, which is a proxy for model sharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and tasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability, which can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the pathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated attention scores, as $\\textit{entropy collapse}$. As a remedy, we propose $\\sigma$Reparam, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all linear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We demonstrate that $\\sigma$Reparam successfully prevents entropy collapse in the attention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally, we prove a tight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases exponentially fast with the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing additional motivation for our approach. We conduct experiments with $\\sigma$Reparam on image classification, image self-supervised learning, machine translation, speech recognition, and language modeling tasks. We show that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training (a) a Vision Transformer {to competitive performance} without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers; (b) deep architectures in machine translation and (c) speech recognition to competitive performance without warmup and adaptive optimizers.

Implicit Regularization Leads to Benign Overfitting for Sparse Linear Regression\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention training stability regularization*\n\n*Mo Zhou, Rong Ge*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that training the new model via gradient descent leads to an interpolator with near-optimal test loss, which is another example of implicit regularization effect that goes beyond norm minimization.\n\n**Abstract:** In deep learning, often the training process finds an interpolator (a solution with 0 training loss), but the test loss is still low. This phenomenon, known as benign overfitting, is a major mystery that received a lot of recent attention. One common mechanism for benign overfitting is implicit regularization, where the training process leads to additional properties for the interpolator, often characterized by minimizing certain norms. However, even for a simple sparse linear regression problem $y = \\beta^{*\\top} x +\\xi$ with sparse $\\beta^*$, neither minimum $\\ell_1$ or $\\ell_2$ norm interpolator gives the optimal test loss. In this work, we give a different parametrization of the model which leads to a new implicit regularization effect that combines the benefit of $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ interpolators. We show that training our new model via gradient descent leads to an interpolator with near-optimal test loss. Our result is based on careful analysis of the training dynamics and provides another example of implicit regularization effect that goes beyond norm minimization.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4.

While some studies have reported that GR can improve generalization performance, little attention has been paid to it from the algorithmic perspective, that is, the algorithms of GR that efficiently improve the performance. In this study, we first reveal that a specific finite-difference computation, composed of both gradient ascent and descent steps, reduces the computational cost of GR. Next, we show that the finite-difference computation also works better in the sense of generalization performance. We theoretically analyze a solvable model, a diagonal linear network, and clarify that GR has a desirable implicit bias to so-called rich regime and finite-difference computation strengthens this bias. Furthermore, finite-difference GR is closely related to some other algorithms based on iterative ascent and descent steps for exploring flat minima. In particular, we reveal that the flooding method can perform finite-difference GR in an implicit way. Thus, this work broadens our understanding of GR for both practice and theory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5. The alignment property of SGD noise and how it helps select flat minima: A stability analysis\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention training stability regularization*\n\n*Lei Wu, Mingze Wang, Weijie J. Su*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that if a global minimum is linearly stable for SGD, then it must satisfy the Frobenius norm of Hessian at $\\theta^*$, batch size, and learning rate, respectively, otherwise SGD will escape from that minimum fast.\n\n**Abstract:** The phenomenon that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) favors flat minima has played a critical role in understanding the implicit regularization of SGD. In this paper, we provide an explanation of this striking phenomenon by relating the particular noise structure of SGD to its \\emph{linear stability} (Wu et al., 2018). Specifically, we consider training over-parameterized models with square loss. We prove that if a global minimum $\\theta^*$ is linearly stable for SGD, then it must satisfy $\\|H(\\theta^*)\\|_F\\leq O(\\sqrt{B}/\\eta)$, where $\\|H(\\theta^*)\\|_F, B,\\eta$ denote the Frobenius norm of Hessian at $\\theta^*$, batch size, and learning rate, respectively. Otherwise, SGD will escape from that minimum \\emph{exponentially} fast. Hence, for minima accessible to SGD, the sharpness -- as measured by the Frobenius norm of the Hessian -- is bounded \\emph{independently} of the model size and sample size. The key to obtaining these results is exploiting the particular structure of SGD noise: The noise concentrates in sharp directions of local landscape and the magnitude is proportional to loss value. This alignment property of SGD noise provably holds for linear networks and random feature models (RFMs), and is empirically verified for nonlinear networks. Moreover, the validity and practical relevance of our theoretical findings are also justified by extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 31  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Instance Enhancement Batch Normalization: an Adaptive Regulator of Batch Noise\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention training stability regularization*\n\n*Haizhao Yang, Senwei Liang, Mingfu Liang, Zhongzhan Huang*\n\n**Abstract:** Batch Normalization (BN)(Ioffe and Szegedy 2015) normalizes the features of an input image via statistics of a batch of images and hence BN will bring the noise to the gradient of the training loss. Previous works indicate that the noise is important for the optimization and generalization of deep neural networks, but too much noise will harm the performance of networks. In our paper, we offer a new point of view that self-attention mechanism can help to regulate the noise by enhancing instance-specific information to obtain a better regularization effect. Therefore, we propose an attention-based BN called Instance Enhancement Batch Normalization (IEBN) that recalibrates the information of each channel by a simple linear transformation. IEBN has a good capacity of regulating noise and stabilizing network training to improve generalization even in the presence of two kinds of noise attacks during training. Finally, IEBN outperforms BN with only a light parameter increment in image classification tasks for different network structures and benchmark datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2019-08-12\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Self-explaining models where interpretability plays a key role already during learning have received much less attention. We propose three desiderata for explanations in general -- explicitness, faithfulness, and stability -- and show that existing methods do not satisfy them. In response, we design self-explaining models in stages, progressively generalizing linear classifiers to complex yet architecturally explicit models. Faithfulness and stability are enforced via regularization specifically tailored to such models. Experimental results across various benchmark datasets show that our framework offers a promising direction for reconciling model complexity and interpretability.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2018-12\n\n**Published:** 2018-12-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the training stability and proper regularization in linear attention models, particularly for autoregressive language models, several techniques and methods can be employed based on the provided sources and analysis.\n\n### Training Stability Techniques\n\n1. **Layer Normalization**:\n   Applying layer normalization not only after the QK layers but also after the Proj and FC2 layers can significantly improve training stability.

This method prevents entropy collapse in attention layers and promotes more stable training by controlling the magnitude of the linear layer weights.\n\n3. **Softmax Capping and Gradient Clipping**:\n   Combining QK layer normalization with softmax capping can increase the learning rate without causing model divergence. Additionally, gradient clipping (e.g., reducing gradient clipping from 1.0 to 0.3) can help mitigate training instabilities.\n\n4. **Learning Rate Scheduling**:\n   Using a linear warm-up strategy to gradually increase the learning rate from a small initial value to a target value can help stabilize the training process and improve convergence.\n\n### Regularization Methods\n\n1. **Weight Decay**:\n   Applying weight decay can help address model training divergence by regularizing the weights and preventing overfitting.\n\n2. **Additional Loss Terms**:\n   Introducing additional loss terms, such as the `z_loss` proposed by Chowdhery et al. (2024), can encourage the softmax normalizer to be close to 0, improving training stability.\n\n### Handling Gradient Issues\n\n1. **Gradient Clipping and Optimizer Selection**:\n   Using gradient clipping and selecting appropriate optimizers (e.g., AdamW-Adafactor) can help reduce loss spikes and improve training stability by managing gradients effectively.\n\n2. **Restarting Training from Checkpoints**:\n   Restarting training from a checkpoint roughly 100 steps before the loss spike started and skipping problematic data batches can help recover from training instabilities.\n\n### Maintaining Consistent Performance Across Different Sequence Lengths\n\n1. **Block Processing Strategy**:\n   Utilizing a tiling strategy that separates intra-block and inter-block computations, as in Lightning Attention-2, can maintain causality and ensure efficient processing of sequences of varying lengths. This approach optimizes GPU memory usage and maintains constant training speed regardless of sequence length.\n\n2. **Mathematical Formulations and Causal Dependencies**:\n   Ensuring proper causal dependencies through mathematical formulations and block-wise processing helps in managing long-range dependencies and maintaining temporal order, which is crucial for consistent performance across different sequence lengths.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can improve the training stability, regularization, and overall performance of autoregressive language models, especially those employing linear attention mechanisms.\n",

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nThe Transformer architecture has achieved widespread adoption, particularly in the domain of large language models\n\n[^0]Preliminary work., Copyright 2024 by the author(s). (LLM) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Peng et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b) and multi-modal models (Li et al., 2022; 2023a; Liu et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b; Lu et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023a; Hao et al., 2024). However, its computational complexity grows quadratically with the length of the input sequence, making it challenging to model extremely long sequences. Unlimited sequence length stands out as a noteworthy aspect within the realm of LLM, attracting considerable attention from researchers who seek intelligent solutions. The potential applications of LLM with unlimited sequence length are diverse, encompassing extended conversations in various professional domains and handling a vast number of tokens in multimodal modeling tasks. In response to the quadratic complexity challenge, a promising resolution emerges in the form of linear attention. This method involves the elimination of the softmax operation and capitalizes on the associativity property of matrix products. Consequently, it significantly accelerates both training and inference procedures. To elaborate, linear attention reduces the computational complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) to compute the attention matrices, where $n$ represents the sequence length. This avenue holds substantial promise for augmenting the efficiency of transformer-style models across a broad spectrum of applications. It is important to note that the notable reduction in complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ in linear attention is only theoretical and may not directly translate to a proportional improvement in computational efficiency on hardware in practice. The realization of practical wall-clock speedup faces challenges, primarily stemming from two issues: 1). the dominance of memory access (I/O) on the GPU could impact the overall computation speed of attention. 2). the cumulative summation (cumsum) needed by the linear attention kernel trick prevents it from reaching its theoretical training speed in the causal setting. The first issue has been successfully addressed by Lightning Attention-1 (Qin et al., 2023b). In this paper, we introduce\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ae38c698417dafba3079g-02.jpg?height=521&width=1709&top_left_y=213&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 1. Speed Showdown: FlashAttention vs. Lightning Attention in Expanding Sequence Lengths and Model Sizes. The diagram above provides a comparative illustration of training speed, Token per GPU per Second (TGS) for LLaMA with FlashAttention-2, TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-1 and TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-2, implemented across three model sizes: 400M, 1B, and 3B from left to right. It is strikingly evident that Lightning Attention-2 manifests a consistent training speed irrespective of the increasing sequence length. Conversely, the other methods significantly decline training speed as the sequence length expands. Lightning Attention-2 to solve the second issue. The key idea is to leverage the concept of \"divide and conquer\" by separately handling the intra block and inter block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, for the intra blocks, we maintain the use of conventional attention computation mechanism to compute the product of QKV, while for the inter blocks, we employ the linear attention kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b). Tiling techniques are implemented in both forward and backward procedures to fully leverage GPU hardware capabilities. As a result, the Lightning Attention-2 can train LLMs with unlimited sequence length without extra cost ${ }^{1}$, as its computational speed remains constant with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of Lightning Attention-2 across a diverse range of sequence lengths to assess its accuracy and compare its computational speed and memory utilization with FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) and Lightning Attention-1. The findings indicate that Lightning Attention-2 exhibits a notable advantage in computational speed, attributed to its innovative intra-inter separation strategy. Additionally, Lightning Attention-2 demonstrates a reduced memory footprint compared to its counterparts without compromising performance. ## 2. Related Work\n\n### 2.1. Linear Attention\n\nLinear Transformer architectures discard the Softmax Attention mechanism, replacing it with distinct approximations (Katharopoulos et al., 2020a; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b;a). The key idea is to\n\n[^1]leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ matrix multiplication.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.25)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/32 (Score: 0.33)*\n\n```\nFigure left shows the details of the module structure.

In this paper we introduce sparse factorizations of the attention matrix which reduce this to $O(n \\sqrt{n})$. We also introduce a) a variation on architecture and initialization to train deeper networks, b) the recomputation of attention matrices to save memory, and c) fast attention kernels for training. We call networks with these changes Sparse Transformers, and show they can model sequences tens of thousands of timesteps long using hundreds of layers. We use the same architecture to model images, audio, and text from raw bytes, setting a new state of the art for density modeling of Enwik8, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-64. We generate unconditional samples that demonstrate global coherence and great diversity, and show it is possible in principle to use self-attention to model sequences of length one million or more.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/19 (Score: 0.31)*\n\n```\nFor text and audio, we used two-dimensional attention embeddings, where $d_{\\text {attn }}=2$ and the index corresponds to each position's row and column index in a matrix of width equal to the stride. ### 5.4. Saving memory by recomputing attention weights\n\nGradient checkpointing has been shown to be effective in reducing the memory requirements of training deep neural networks (Chen et al., 2016), (Gruslys et al., 2016). It is worth noting, however, that this technique is particularly effective for self-attention layers when long sequences are processed, as memory usage is high for these layers relative to the cost of computing them. Using recomputation alone, we are able to train dense attention networks with hundreds of layers on sequence lengths of 16,384 , which would be infeasible on modern hardware otherwise. In our experiments, we recompute the attention and feedforward blocks during the backwards pass. To simplify our implementation, we do not apply dropout within the attention blocks, as in (Vaswani et al., 2017), and instead only apply it at the end of each residual addition, as seen in Figure 4. ### 5.5. Efficient block-sparse attention kernels\n\nThe sparse attention masks in 3(b) and 3(c) can be efficiently computed by slicing out sub-blocks from the query, key, and value matrices and computing the product in blocks. Attention over a local window can be computed as-is, whereas attention with a stride of $k$ can be computed by transposing the matrix and computing a local window. Fixed attention positions can be aggregated and computed in blocks. In order to ease experimentation, we implemented a set of GPU kernels which efficiently perform these operations. The softmax operation is fused into a single kernel and also uses registers to eliminate loading the input data more than once, allowing it to run at the same speed as a simple nonlinearity. The upper triangle of the attention matrix is never computed, moreover, removing the need for the negative bias term of (Vaswani et al., 2017) and halving the number of operations to be performed. ### 5.6. Mixed-precision training\n\nWe store network weights in single-precision floating-point, but otherwise compute network activations and gradients in half-precision, as in (Micikevicius et al., 2017). This accelerates our training due to the usage of Tensor Core operations on the V100 GPU. During the gradient calculation, we use\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_befcc9f073998d256dabg-07.jpg?height=985&width=1706&top_left_y=207&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 5. Unconditional samples from ImageNet 64x64, generated with an unmodified softmax temperature of 1.0. We are able to learn long-range dependencies directly from pixels without using a multi-scale architecture. dynamic loss scaling to reduce numerical underflow, and we communicate half-precision gradients when averaging across multiple GPUs. When sampling, we cast the queries and keys to single-precision, as the query-key product can sometimes overflow the max value of half-precision. ## 6. Training\n\nWe use the Adam optimizer with a linear warmup of 5000 iterations and a gradient clipping of 1.0 , both of which we found important for model stability. We use a weight decay penalty of 0.01 . We annealed the learning rate according to a cosine decay as in (Radford et al., 2018). We train on 8 V100 GPUs unless otherwise noted. All embeddings are of a constant dimension $d$, usually one of $\\{256,512,1024\\}$. By default, all linear transforms are to the same dimension, with the exception of the feed-forward network, which projects the input to $4 d$, unless we use \"half-size\" transformations, where it is $2 d$. Additionally, sometimes we halve the size of the query and key transformations.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization linear attention initialization*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 70  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 2. Faster proximal algorithms for matrix optimization using Jacobi-based eigenvalue methods\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization linear attention initialization*\n\n*Hamza Fawzi, H. Goulbourne*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes to use an old and surprisingly simple method due to Jacobi to compute eigenvalue and singular value decompositions, and demonstrates that it can lead to substantial gains in terms of computation time compared to standard approaches.\n\n**Abstract:** We consider proximal splitting algorithms for convex optimization problems over matrices. A signi\ufb01cant computational bottleneck in many of these algorithms is the need to compute a full eigenvalue or singular value decomposition at each iteration for the evaluation of a proximal operator. In this paper we propose to use an old and surprisingly simple method due to Jacobi to compute these eigenvalue and singular value decompositions, and we demonstrate that it can lead to substantial gains in terms of computation time compared to standard approaches. We rely on three essential properties of this method: (a) its ability to exploit an approximate decomposition as an initial point, which in the case of iterative optimization algorithms can be obtained from the previous iterate; (b) its parallel nature which makes it a great \ufb01t for hardware accelerators such as GPUs, now common in machine learning, and (c) its simple termination criterion which allows us to trade-off accuracy with computation time. We demonstrate the ef\ufb01cacy of this approach on a variety of algorithms and problems, and show that, on a GPU, we can obtain 5 to 10x speed-ups in the evaluation of proximal operators compared to standard CPU or GPU linear algebra routines. Our \ufb01ndings are supported by new theoretical results providing guarantees on the approximation quality of proximal operators obtained using approximate eigenvalue or singular value decompositions.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. ShiftAddViT: Mixture of Multiplication Primitives Towards Efficient Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization linear attention initialization*\n\n*Haoran You, Huihong Shi, Yipin Guo, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to reparameterize pre-trained ViTs with a mixture of multiplication primitives, e.g., bitwise shifts and additions, towards a new type of multiplication-reduced model, dubbed ShiftAddViT, which aims to achieve end-to-end inference speedups on GPUs without requiring training from scratch.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown impressive performance and have become a unified backbone for multiple vision tasks. However, both the attention mechanism and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) in ViTs are not sufficiently efficient due to dense multiplications, leading to costly training and inference. To this end, we propose to reparameterize pre-trained ViTs with a mixture of multiplication primitives, e.g., bitwise shifts and additions, towards a new type of multiplication-reduced model, dubbed $\\textbf{ShiftAddViT}$, which aims to achieve end-to-end inference speedups on GPUs without requiring training from scratch. Specifically, all $\\texttt{MatMuls}$ among queries, keys, and values are reparameterized using additive kernels, after mapping queries and keys to binary codes in Hamming space. The remaining MLPs or linear layers are then reparameterized with shift kernels. We utilize TVM to implement and optimize those customized kernels for practical hardware deployment on GPUs. We find that such a reparameterization on attention maintains model accuracy, while inevitably leading to accuracy drops when being applied to MLPs. To marry the best of both worlds, we further propose a new mixture of experts (MoE) framework to reparameterize MLPs by taking multiplication or its primitives as experts, e.g., multiplication and shift, and designing a new latency-aware load-balancing loss. Such a loss helps to train a generic router for assigning a dynamic amount of input tokens to different experts according to their latency. Extensive experiments on various 2D/3D Transformer-based vision tasks consistently validate the effectiveness of our proposed ShiftAddViT, achieving up to $\\textbf{5.18$\\times$}$ latency reductions on GPUs and $\\textbf{42.9}$% energy savings, while maintaining a comparable accuracy as original or efficient ViTs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization linear attention initialization*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 273  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 5. On p-norm Path Following in Multiple Kernel Learning for Non-linear Feature Selection\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization linear attention initialization*\n\n*Pratik Jawanpuria, M. Varma, SakethaNath Jagarlapudi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel conjecture which states that, for certain lp-MKL formulations, the number of features selected in the optimal solution monotonically decreases as p is decreased from an initial value to unity and proves the conjecture, for a generic family of kernel target alignment based formulations.\n\n**Abstract:** Our objective is to develop formulations and algorithms for efficiently computing the feature selection path - i.e. the variation in classification accuracy as the fraction of selected features is varied from null to unity. Multiple Kernel Learning subject to lp\u22641 regularization (lp-MKL) has been demonstrated to be one of the most effective techniques for non-linear feature selection. However, state-of-the-art lp-MKL algorithms are too computationally expensive to be invoked thousands of times to determine the entire path. \n \nWe propose a novel conjecture which states that, for certain lp-MKL formulations, the number of features selected in the optimal solution monotonically decreases as p is decreased from an initial value to unity. We prove the conjecture, for a generic family of kernel target alignment based formulations, and show that the feature weights themselves decay (grow) monotonically once they are below (above) a certain threshold at optimality. This allows us to develop a path following algorithm that systematically generates optimal feature sets of decreasing size. The proposed algorithm sets certain feature weights directly to zero for potentially large intervals of p thereby reducing optimization costs while simultaneously providing approximation guarantees. \n \nWe empirically demonstrate that our formulation can lead to classification accuracies which are as much as 10% higher on benchmark data sets not only as compared to other lp-MKL formulations and uniform kernel baselines but also leading feature selection methods. We further demonstrate that our algorithm reduces training time significantly over other path following algorithms and state-of-the-art lp-MKL optimizers such as SMO-MKL. In particular, we generate the entire feature selection path for data sets with a hundred thousand features in approximately half an hour on standard hardware. Entire path generation for such data set is well beyond the scaling capabilities of other methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2014\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. FlexGen: High-Throughput Generative Inference of Large Language Models with a Single GPU\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization linear attention initialization*\n\n*Ce Zhang, Ion Stoica, Christopher R\u00e9, Percy Liang, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Clark Barrett, Beidi Chen, Zhiqiang Xie, Daniel Y. Fu, Max Ryabinin, Zhuohan Li, Binhang Yuan, Lianmin Zheng, Ying Sheng*\n\n**Abstract:** The high computational and memory requirements of large language model (LLM) inference make it feasible only with multiple high-end accelerators. Motivated by the emerging demand for latency-insensitive tasks with batched processing, this paper initiates the study of high-throughput LLM inference using limited resources, such as a single commodity GPU. We present FlexGen, a high-throughput generation engine for running LLMs with limited GPU memory. FlexGen can be flexibly configured under various hardware resource constraints by aggregating memory and computation from the GPU, CPU, and disk. By solving a linear programming problem, it searches for efficient patterns to store and access tensors. FlexGen further compresses the weights and the attention cache to 4 bits with negligible accuracy loss. These techniques enable FlexGen to have a larger space of batch size choices and thus significantly increase maximum throughput. As a result, when running OPT-175B on a single 16GB GPU, FlexGen achieves significantly higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art offloading systems, reaching a generation throughput of 1 token/s for the first time with an effective batch size of 144. On the HELM benchmark, FlexGen can benchmark a 30B model with a 16GB GPU on 7 representative sub-scenarios in 21 hours.

This approach involves sharding the context heterogeneously among attention heads, where each head attends to a different subset of tokens while collectively covering the full context. This design ensures high parallelization and optimized memory IO, leading to significant speed-ups in both training and inference.\n\n### Memristor-Based Acceleration\nThe use of memristor-based in-memory computing can also optimize hardware performance. This approach integrates computation into memory using memristor crossbar arrays, which can perform matrix operations efficiently. This method reduces power consumption and latency, making it suitable for transformer self-attention calculations.\n\n## Linear Attention Implementations\n\n### Block-Wise Processing\nThe \"Lightning Attention-2\" approach divides attention calculations into intra-blocks and inter-blocks to handle unlimited sequence lengths efficiently. This block-wise processing strategy helps in maintaining causal dependencies and reduces computational complexity, which is crucial for autoregressive models[Analysis Note, Section 3].\n\n### Hybrid Sparse and Dense Attention\nCombining sparse and dense attention can balance efficiency and performance. The S2-Attention architecture uses a hybrid design where sparse attention is applied in a hardware-friendly manner, and dense attention is used at certain layers to ensure direct access to all tokens. This hybrid approach maintains strong performance on long-context tasks while achieving significant speed-ups.\n\n## Initialization Strategies and Normalization Techniques\n\n### Specialized Normalization\nTraining stability can be achieved through specialized normalization techniques. For instance, layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function can help stabilize the training process[Analysis Note, Section 2].\n\n### Reparameterization Methods\nThe \u03c3Reparam method can prevent attention entropy collapse, a common issue in transformer training. This method helps in maintaining appropriate entropy levels, which is crucial for stable training[Analysis Note, Section 2].\n\n### Careful Initialization\nCareful initialization is essential for gradient control and preventing pathological collapse. Specialized initialization strategies can help in maintaining model expressiveness while ensuring stability[Analysis Note, Section 3].\n\n## Memory Management Approaches\n\n### Efficient Memory IO\nThe S2-Attention approach ensures optimized memory IO by sharding the context heterogeneously among attention heads. This design minimizes the IO between SRAM and HBM, leading to practical efficiency improvements.\n\n### Memory-Augmented Transformers\nMemory-augmented Transformers (Memformers) retain intermediate attention values across layers through memory registers. This approach enables the implementation of advanced optimization methods and helps in storing past gradients, which can improve training efficiency and stability.\n\nBy integrating these hardware optimization techniques, linear attention implementations, and careful initialization and normalization strategies, researchers can significantly improve the stability, efficiency, and performance of autoregressive language models.\n",

Major differences highlighted in red. At the core of attention is a mechanism that dynamically highlights relevant context features for a given query input. In the vanilla softmax-based attention model (Vaswani et al., 2017, SMATt), this is achieved by imposing a categorical distribution constraint on the query-context relevance (i.e. attention) scores, implemented with the softmax activation (see Figure 1(a)). SMATT produces dense distributions, assigning some small amounts of attention even to irrelevant features. This complicates the analysis of the information flow in the model, and has led researchers to study sparse alternatives, which often lead to improved model performance and/or interpretability (Correia et al., 2019). Efforts in this category include designing fixed sparsity patterns (Raganato et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019) and creating sparsified softmax variants (Martins and Astudillo, 2016; Peters et al., 2019). However, these methods also have drawbacks. Fixed sparsity patterns lack flexibility and generalize poorly across tasks. Sparsified softmax variants often depend on complex inference algorithms (e.g., requiring the sorting operation), which reduces their efficiency. In this paper, we propose rectified linear attention (ReLA) to alleviate the above problems. ReLA\nuses ReLU rather than softmax as an activation function for attention scores, abandoning the probabilistic constraint. ${ }^{2}$ ReLU is inherently sparse since negative activations are dropped, and we will show that such sparse behaviour indeed emerges during training. In contrast to softmax activations, the output of ReLU can be any non-negative value, providing extra flexibility. To stabilize gradients and ease model convergence, we apply layer normalization together with a specialized initialization or a gating mechanism. Figure 1(b) shows ReLA, and also contrasts it with SMATT. ReLA is an easy-to-implement drop-in replacement for SMATT that requires no specialized operations or inference processes. Note that the behaviour of ReLA is data-driven, and it does not enforce a constant attention mass or sparsity level across queries, even allowing for null attention (all attention scores are zero) for some queries. We provide experimental results for ReLA with Transformer on five machine translation tasks, along with an in-depth analysis on WMT14 English-German task. Our contributions are summarized below:\n\n- We propose ReLA, a drop-in SMATT alternative, that learns sparse attention automatically with high flexibility and efficiency. - Experiments on five translation tasks show that ReLA achieves comparable translation performance, with similar training/decoding speed to SMATT, but is substantially faster than sparsified softmax baselines. - Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate, high head diversity, and better accuracy than all baselines with respect to source-target word alignment. We also observe the emergence of attention heads with a high rate of null attention, only activating for certain queries. For some heads, this null rate can also indicate the quality of sentence pairs. ## 2 Related Work\n\nReLA ensures sparsity in attention. An alternative solution in this direction is to develop sparsified softmax alternatives, such as sparsemax (Martins and Astudillo, 2016; Malaviya et al., 2018), entmax (Peters et al., 2019; Correia et al., 2019), fusedmax (Niculae and Blondel, 2017), and\n\n[^1]hashing/clustering-based variants (Roy et al., 2020; Kitaev et al., 2020). These models often require dedicated algorithms for forward and backward propagation, at the cost of a significant computational overhead. Another strategy is to manually define sparse patterns inspired by task-specific attention analysis. Raganato et al. (2020) corroborated the feasibility of fixed patterns for Transformer encoder in translation. Child et al. (2019) introduced local and strided patterns to scale SMATT up to very long inputs. Unlike data-driven approaches, whether these patterns could generalize to different tasks and settings is still an open question. In contrast, ReLA is both data-driven and efficient. In this respect, our work shares similarity with the explicit sparse Transformer (Zhao et al., 2019) which also delivers faster speed but still depends on top- $k$ sorting as in sparsemax and entmax with $k$, a tunable hyperparameter. Note that all the above mentioned methods follow the categorical distribution constraint on attentions, while ReLA goes beyond. Thus, unlike ReLA, none of them enables null attentions. A different type of linear attention model is proposed by Katharopoulos et al. (2020) and Choromanski et al. (2020), who aim at reducing the $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ complexity in SMAtT. These models behave fundamentally differently from ReLA, because they eliminate the token-wise modeling rather than introducing sparsity. The explanatory power of standard attention weights is hotly debated (Wiegreffe and Pinter, 2019; Jain and Wallace, 2019). Much of the criticism stems from the observation that low attention scores do not always imply irrelevance of the corresponding feature, as the information can still flow and its influence can be large (e.g., due to the large magnitude of the corresponding features). In contrast, sparse variants, including ReLA, assign exact zeroes, ensuring that the information flow from the corresponding features within the attention component is cut completely. Even with standard attention, prior studies show some evidence that attention partially reflects linguistic properties. In machine translation, the encoder-decoder attention captures the source-target word alignment to a certain degree (Ghader and Monz, 2017), with recent work further strengthening this via specific induction methods (Ding et al., 2019; Kobayashi et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020). We apply analysis techniques from previous work to analyze our\nmodels. ## 3 Background: Attention in Transformer\n\nMany variants of attention mechanism have been developed since its first proposal (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). In this paper, we focus on the one used by Transformer, namely multihead scaled dot-product attention (MHATT), in an encoder-decoder setup. Given query inputs $\\mathbf{X} \\in$ $\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ and a sequence of context items $\\mathbf{Y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d}$, each head in MHATT summarizes query-relevant context information as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{SMATT}(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y}) & =\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\mathbf{V}, \\\\\n\\text { with } \\quad \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} & =\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(f\\left(\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}^{T}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith $\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{X W}_{q} ; \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{Y W}_{k}, \\mathbf{Y} \\mathbf{W}_{v}$, where $n$ and $m$ are the query and context length, respectively; $d$ and $d_{h}$ are the model and head dimension, respectively; $\\mathbf{W}_{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d_{h}}$ denotes trainable model parameters. $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times m}$ is the attention weight, which estimates the degree of relevance between one query input and each context. The softmax normalizes the scores and ensures that the attention weights $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ define a categorical distribution. $f(\\cdot)$ is a scoring function. Different attention mechanisms make different choices for $f(\\cdot)$, but the use of softmax, or its sparsified variants, is universal. SMATt in Transformer adopts the scaled dot product for $f(\\cdot)$, which is further extended by MHATT to allow for parallel attentions in different sub-spaces over the same inputs:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{MHATT}(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y})=\\left[\\operatorname{SMATT}^{1}, \\ldots, \\operatorname{SMATT}^{H}\\right] \\mathbf{W}_{o}\n$$\n\nwhere $[\\cdot, \\cdot]$ denotes the concatenation operation, $H$ is the number of heads, $\\mathbf{W}_{o} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H d_{h} \\times d}$ are output transformation parameters, and $d=H d_{h}$. In the encoder-decoder framework, MHATt is used in three different ways: Encoder Attention, Decoder Attention and Cross Attention, modeling intra-source, intra-target, and source-target dependencies, respectively. Transformer performs layered MHATT with residual connection and layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016) to handle variations of token-wise dependencies. The learning of MHATT is guided by the training objective, often without direct supervision. ## 4 Rectified Linear Attention\n\nWe argue that the use of the softmax function in SMATT (Eq. 1) has two undesirable consequences:\n\n- The attention mass is densely distributed over all context items, even the ones that are intuitively irrelevant. - The attention mass for each query is constant, although the relevance of context may vary. Both potentially hamper interpretability and even performance. ${ }^{3}$\n\nAs an alternative to sparsified softmax variants (Peters et al., 2019; Correia et al., 2019), we go one step further and consider whether the softmax, or broadly the categorical distribution, could be avoided completely. Model Structure We offer an answer to the question by proposing rectified linear attention (ReLA). ReLA abandons the distribution assumption and adopts linear activation instead. It is formulated as follows (see Figure 1(b) for illustration):\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{ReLA}(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y}) & =\\operatorname{LN}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\mathbf{V}) \\\\\n\\text { with } \\quad \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} & =\\operatorname{ReLU}\\left(f\\left(\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}^{T}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $f(\\cdot)$ denotes any scoring function as in Eq. 1, $\\mathrm{LN}(\\cdot)$ denotes variants of layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016; Zhang and Sennrich, 2019), and $\\operatorname{ReLU}(\\cdot)=\\max (0, \\cdot)$ is the rectified linear unit. Note here, we describe our model by assuming only one attention head for clarity. In the multihead ReLA, we impose the normalization $\\operatorname{LN}(\\cdot)$ on the concatenated head representation rather than each single head separately. Unlike SMATT, ReLA prunes out all negative scores of low query-context relevance, automatically ensuring the sparse property of the attention weight $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times m}$. Besides, ReLA allows for null attention, where it assigns zero scores to all context items (i.e. some rows of $\\alpha$ are zero vectors), effectively switching off the corresponding attention head for certain queries. Nevertheless, the outputs of ReLU in Eq. 3 are often of different scales and varied variance, causing gradient instability and also optimization failure. Stabilization with Normalization A common strategy in deep learning to stabilize neuron activations is to apply layer normalization $\\mathrm{LN}(\\cdot)(\\mathrm{Ba}$\n\n[^2]et al., 2016). We follow this strategy and normalize each representation $\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{h}}$ in the attention outputs $(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\mathbf{V})$ with root mean square layer normalization (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019, RMSNorm):\n$$\n\\operatorname{LN}(\\mathbf{z})=\\operatorname{RMSNorm}(\\mathbf{z})=\\frac{\\mathbf{z}}{\\operatorname{RMS}(\\mathbf{z})} \\odot \\mathbf{g}\n$$\nwhere $\\odot$ denotes the element-wise multiplication, $\\mathrm{RMS}(\\cdot)$ calculates the root mean square statistic, and $\\mathrm{g} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{h}}$ is the gain parameter, usually initialized at 1. We adopt RMSNorm rather than the vanilla LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) for ReLA because it avoids the re-centering constraint, being more flexible and computationally simpler. Although RMSNorm largely smooths gradients, our preliminary experiments show that ReLA still suffers from unstable gradients during early training, delivering suboptimal convergence. We propose two solutions, corresponding to two variants of ReLA, to solve this problem by down-scaling ReLA's activations. ReLA- $i$ changes the initialization of the gain parameter $g$ in RMSNorm with a uniform xavier initializer: $\\mathbf{g} \\sim \\mathcal{U}\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{d_{h}}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{d_{h}}}\\right) .{ }^{4}$\n\nReLA- $g$ adds a simple gating function to the normalization:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{LN}(\\mathbf{z})=\\sigma(\\mathbf{w} \\odot \\mathbf{z}) \\odot \\operatorname{RMSNorm}(\\mathbf{z})\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sigma(\\cdot)$ denotes the sigmoid function, and $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{h}}$ is a trainable parameter.\n```\n\n#### 2. Generating Long Sequences with Sparse Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.03)\n\n*R. Child, S. Gray, Alec Radford, I.

In this paper we introduce sparse factorizations of the attention matrix which reduce this to $O(n \\sqrt{n})$. We also introduce a) a variation on architecture and initialization to train deeper networks, b) the recomputation of attention matrices to save memory, and c) fast attention kernels for training. We call networks with these changes Sparse Transformers, and show they can model sequences tens of thousands of timesteps long using hundreds of layers. We use the same architecture to model images, audio, and text from raw bytes, setting a new state of the art for density modeling of Enwik8, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-64. We generate unconditional samples that demonstrate global coherence and great diversity, and show it is possible in principle to use self-attention to model sequences of length one million or more.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/19 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nFor text and audio, we used two-dimensional attention embeddings, where $d_{\\text {attn }}=2$ and the index corresponds to each position's row and column index in a matrix of width equal to the stride. ### 5.4. Saving memory by recomputing attention weights\n\nGradient checkpointing has been shown to be effective in reducing the memory requirements of training deep neural networks (Chen et al., 2016), (Gruslys et al., 2016). It is worth noting, however, that this technique is particularly effective for self-attention layers when long sequences are processed, as memory usage is high for these layers relative to the cost of computing them. Using recomputation alone, we are able to train dense attention networks with hundreds of layers on sequence lengths of 16,384 , which would be infeasible on modern hardware otherwise. In our experiments, we recompute the attention and feedforward blocks during the backwards pass. To simplify our implementation, we do not apply dropout within the attention blocks, as in (Vaswani et al., 2017), and instead only apply it at the end of each residual addition, as seen in Figure 4. ### 5.5. Efficient block-sparse attention kernels\n\nThe sparse attention masks in 3(b) and 3(c) can be efficiently computed by slicing out sub-blocks from the query, key, and value matrices and computing the product in blocks. Attention over a local window can be computed as-is, whereas attention with a stride of $k$ can be computed by transposing the matrix and computing a local window. Fixed attention positions can be aggregated and computed in blocks. In order to ease experimentation, we implemented a set of GPU kernels which efficiently perform these operations. The softmax operation is fused into a single kernel and also uses registers to eliminate loading the input data more than once, allowing it to run at the same speed as a simple nonlinearity. The upper triangle of the attention matrix is never computed, moreover, removing the need for the negative bias term of (Vaswani et al., 2017) and halving the number of operations to be performed. ### 5.6. Mixed-precision training\n\nWe store network weights in single-precision floating-point, but otherwise compute network activations and gradients in half-precision, as in (Micikevicius et al., 2017). This accelerates our training due to the usage of Tensor Core operations on the V100 GPU. During the gradient calculation, we use\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_befcc9f073998d256dabg-07.jpg?height=985&width=1706&top_left_y=207&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 5. Unconditional samples from ImageNet 64x64, generated with an unmodified softmax temperature of 1.0. We are able to learn long-range dependencies directly from pixels without using a multi-scale architecture. dynamic loss scaling to reduce numerical underflow, and we communicate half-precision gradients when averaging across multiple GPUs. When sampling, we cast the queries and keys to single-precision, as the query-key product can sometimes overflow the max value of half-precision. ## 6. Training\n\nWe use the Adam optimizer with a linear warmup of 5000 iterations and a gradient clipping of 1.0 , both of which we found important for model stability. We use a weight decay penalty of 0.01 . We annealed the learning rate according to a cosine decay as in (Radford et al., 2018). We train on 8 V100 GPUs unless otherwise noted. All embeddings are of a constant dimension $d$, usually one of $\\{256,512,1024\\}$. By default, all linear transforms are to the same dimension, with the exception of the feed-forward network, which projects the input to $4 d$, unless we use \"half-size\" transformations, where it is $2 d$. Additionally, sometimes we halve the size of the query and key transformations. We initialize the token embedding $W_{e}$ from $\\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\frac{0.125}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)$ and the position embeddings from $\\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\frac{0.125}{\\sqrt{d n_{\\text {emb }}}}\\right)$. Within the attention and feedforward components, all biases are initial- ized to 0 and all weights are initialized from $\\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\frac{0.125}{\\sqrt{d_{i n}}}\\right)$ where $d_{i n}$ is the fan-in dimension.\n```\n\n#### 3. Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg. Score: 0.02)\n\n*Han Bao, Ryuichiro Hataya, Ryo Karakida*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices is characterized and it is revealed that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n**Abstract:** The self-attention mechanism prevails in modern machine learning. It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

On the one hand, Dong et al. [6] and Noci et al. [19] initiated the discussion of attention localization and theoretically showed that a network with self-attention layers without skip connections exponentially loses the rank of hidden layers; the fact indicates that the model expressivity shall be immediately lost with more self-attention layers stacked. On the other hand, Zhai et al. [31] empirically found that attention entropy-averaged Shannon entropy of an attention probability matrix-correlates with training stability. Specifically, a training loss curve tends to fall into a plateau when attention entropy is low. Since higher entropy indicates near-uniform attention weights, their finding apparently suggests that localized attention may lead the learning dynamics to a plateau. Up until now, these two failure modes have been discussed independently with slightly different notions of attention localization, and hence, our understanding of the blessing and curse of attention localization remains elusive. To better comprehend, we characterize self-attention patterns by attention parameter matrices to reconcile the two collapse modes. We formulate the concept of localization by signal propagation probability (Section 3), which describes how likely the signal of a specific input token propagates to the gradient of a training objective. If the signal propagation probability is high for a few numbers of tokens only, attention is regarded to be localized. We show that the localization mode can be characterized by the eigenspectrum of attention weight matrices (Section 4). Specifically, attention is localized in the above sense when the eigenspectrum of the query-key parameter matrix has a non-zero mean and a small variance. Furthermore, the small eigenspectrum variance is relevant to both the rank collapse and entropy collapse (Section 5), and thus, we give a unified perspective of the two notions of attention collapse. For this reason, we argue that attention collapse and its performance can be viewed more transparently based on the eigenspectrum variance. Lastly, we verified the correlation of the eigenspectrum and the model performance in the experiments with the WikiText dataset [16] by introducing a regularization scheme called LocAteR.\n```\n\n#### 4.

In this paper, we theoretically study the generalization of SSMs and propose improvements to training algorithms based on the generalization results. Specifically, we give a \\textit{data-dependent} generalization bound for SSMs, showing an interplay between the SSM parameters and the temporal dependencies of the training sequences. Leveraging the generalization bound, we (1) set up a scaling rule for model initialization based on the proposed generalization measure, which significantly improves the robustness of the output value scales on SSMs to different temporal patterns in the sequence data; (2) introduce a new regularization method for training SSMs to enhance the generalization performance. Numerical results are conducted to validate our results.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/32 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\n(2018); Chen et al. (2019); Tu et al. (2019) proved norm-based generalization bounds, improving the VC dimension-based bounds by the Rademacher complexity technique (Bartlett and Mendelson, 2002) under the uniform-convergence framework. In the overparameterization settings, it was\nshown in Allen-Zhu and Li (2019) that RNNs can learn some concept class in polynomial time given that the model size is large enough. These generalization bounds, however, do not take into account the temporal dependencies and their effects on generalization. In this work, we provide a new generalization bound by combining the memory structure of the model and the temporal structure of the data. Temporal structure analysis on RNNs. Sequence data has long-range temporal dependencies across the time domain, which notably set it apart from non-sequence data. Recent studies have studied the effects of such temporal dependencies on the approximation and optimization of RNNs. For example, in the two works of Li et al. (2021; 2022), a \"curse of memory\" phenomenon was discovered when using linear RNNs to model the temporal input-output relationships. Particularly, when the target relationship between the input and output has a long-term memory, then both approximation and optimization become extremely challenging. In Wang et al. (2023), the \"curse of memory\" phenomenon on approximation and optimization was extended to non-linear RNNs based on the temporal relationships. In this paper, we conduct a finegrained analysis on the effects of the temporal structure analysis on the generalization of RNNs. Optimization of SSMs. RNN optimization is known for two issues: training stability and computational cost (Bengio et al., 1994; Pascanu et al., 2013). To address these issues and capture the long dependencies efficiently in sequence modeling, the S4 model was proposed by new paraemterization, initialization and discretization (Gu et al., 2022a). Recent variants for the S4 model simplified the hidden state matrix by a diagonal matrix to enhance computational efficiency (Gu et al., 2022b; Gupta et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023; Orvieto et al., 2023). Regularization methods are also applied for SSMs to prevent overfitting, such as dropout, weight decay and the data continuity regularizer ( Qu et al., 2023). However, the principled way to regularize and initialize the parameters still remains to be explored. In this study, we design a new regularization and initialization scheme to improve both optimization and generalization. ## 3 Preliminaries\n\nIn this section, we briefly introduce the SSM in Section 3.1 and the motivation for optimization designs based on the generalization analysis in Section 3.2. ### 3.1 Introduction to SSMs\n\nIn this paper, we consider the following single-input single-output SSM,\n\n$$\nh^{\\prime}(t)=A h(t)+B x(t), \\quad y(t)=C h(t), \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\n\nwhere $x$ is the input from an input space ${ }^{1} \\mathcal{X}:=C_{0}\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}, \\mathbb{R}\\right) ; y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the output at time $t ; h(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is the hidden state with $h(0)=0 ; A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times m}, B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times 1}, C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times m}$ are trainable parameters. Then (1) has an explicit solution $y(t)=\\int_{0}^{t} \\rho_{\\theta}(s) x(t-s) d s$, where $\\rho_{\\theta}(s):=C e^{A s} B$ with $\\theta=(C, A, B)$. The function $\\rho_{\\theta}(s)$ captures the memory structure of the model and the temporal input-output relationship (Li et al., 2022). For the S4 model and its variants (Gu et al., 2022a;b; Gupta et al., 2022; Gu et al., 2023), (1) is usually discretized by the Zero-Order Hold method, i.e., given a timescale $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}, h_{k+1}=$ $\\bar{A} h_{k}+\\bar{B} x_{k}, \\quad y_{k}=\\bar{C} h_{k}, \\quad k=0,1, \\ldots$, where $\\bar{A}=e^{\\Delta \\cdot A}, \\bar{B}=\\left(\\bar{A}-\\mathbb{I}_{m}\\right) A^{-1} B, \\bar{C}=C$. Then, $y_{k}=\\bar{C} \\bar{A}^{k} \\bar{B} x_{0}+\\bar{C} \\bar{A}^{k-1} \\bar{B} x_{1}+\\ldots+\\bar{C} \\bar{B} x_{k}=[\\bar{K} * x]_{k}$ where $\\bar{K}=\\left(\\bar{C} \\bar{B}, \\bar{C} \\bar{A} \\bar{B}, \\ldots, \\bar{C} \\bar{A}{ }^{k} \\bar{B}\\right)$ and $*$ represents to convolution.

This example then motivates us to extend the connection to SSMs on sequential data. Linear regression. We consider a simple linear model $y=\\theta^{\\top} x$ with input $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, output $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and parameter $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Let the training data $\\left\\{\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)\\right\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ be i.i.d. sampled from a distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ such that $\\left\\|x_{i}\\right\\|_{2}=r,\\left|y_{i}\\right| \\leq 1(\\forall i \\in[1: n])$. Define the empirical risk $\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\theta):=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\theta^{\\top} x_{i}-y_{i}\\right)^{2}$ and the population risk $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathcal{D}}(\\theta):=\\mathbb{E}_{x, y}\\left[\\left(\\theta^{\\top} x-y\\right)^{2}\\right]$. Then given a norm-constrained space $\\Theta:=\\left\\{\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}:\\|\\theta\\|_{2} \\leq\\right.$ $R\\}$, with probability at least $1-\\delta$ over $\\mathcal{D}$,\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\theta \\in \\Theta}\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\theta)-\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathcal{D}}(\\theta)\\right| \\leq(r R+1)^{2} \\cdot \\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\log (1 / \\delta) / n})\n$$\n\nThis is a well-known norm-based generalization bound based on the Rademacher theory (Mohri et al., 2012), and we provide a proof in Appendix B for completeness. Notice that the key term $r^{2} R^{2}$ in the generalization bound (2) is also an upper bound for the magnitude of the linear model output, i.e., $\\sup _{\\theta \\in \\Theta}\\left(\\theta^{\\top} x_{i}\\right)^{2} \\leq r^{2} R^{2}$. Thus, we connect the model stability with the generalization bound stability, and this connection induces an initialization scheme for the initialization $\\theta^{(0)}$ by setting $\\left\\|\\theta^{(0)}\\right\\|_{2} \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1 / r)$. In particular, if we normalize each input $x_{i}$ such that $r$ is also $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, then $\\left\\|\\theta^{(0)}\\right\\|_{2} \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1)$. Since $\\theta^{(0)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, one possible initialization scheme is that $\\theta^{(0)}$ follows a Uniform distribution $U[-1 / \\sqrt{d}, 1 / \\sqrt{d}]$, which corresponds to the Kaiming initialization (up to some constant) (He et al., 2015). When treating the term $r^{2} R^{2}$ as a regularizer to improve the generalization, we get the weight decay method, i.e., the $\\ell_{2}$ regularization w.r.t.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: differential attention training stability initialization\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Motivated by the success of Transformers, we study the covariance matrix of a modified Softmax-based attention model with skip connections in the proportional limit of infinite-depth-and-width. We show that at initialization the limiting distribution can be described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) indexed by the depth-to-width ratio. To achieve a well-defined stochastic limit, the Transformer's attention mechanism is modified by centering the Softmax output at identity, and scaling the Softmax logits by a width-dependent temperature parameter. We examine the stability of the network through the corresponding SDE, showing how the scale of both the drift and diffusion can be elegantly controlled with the aid of residual connections. The existence of a stable SDE implies that the covariance structure is well-behaved, even for very large depth and width, thus preventing the notorious issues of rank degeneracy in deep attention models. Finally, we show, through simulations, that the SDE provides a surprisingly good description of the corresponding finite-size model. We coin the name shaped Transformer for these architectural modifications.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: differential attention training stability initialization*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: it replaces the softmax activation with a ReLU, and shows that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4. Vectorized Conditional Neural Fields: A Framework for Solving Time-dependent Parametric Partial Differential Equations\n\n*From Search Query: differential attention training stability initialization*\n\n*Jan Hagnberger, Marimuthu Kalimuthu, Daniel Musekamp, Mathias Niepert*\n\n**TL;DR:** Vectorized Conditional Neural Fields (VCNeFs), which represent the solution of time-dependent PDEs as neural fields, are proposed, which are competitive with and often outperform existing ML-based surrogate models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models are increasingly used for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Several adaptations have been proposed, all of which suffer from the typical problems of Transformers, such as quadratic memory and time complexity. Furthermore, all prevalent architectures for PDE solving lack at least one of several desirable properties of an ideal surrogate model, such as (i) generalization to PDE parameters not seen during training, (ii) spatial and temporal zero-shot super-resolution, (iii) continuous temporal extrapolation, (iv) support for 1D, 2D, and 3D PDEs, and (v) efficient inference for longer temporal rollouts. To address these limitations, we propose Vectorized Conditional Neural Fields (VCNeFs), which represent the solution of time-dependent PDEs as neural fields. Contrary to prior methods, however, VCNeFs compute, for a set of multiple spatio-temporal query points, their solutions in parallel and model their dependencies through attention mechanisms. Moreover, VCNeF can condition the neural field on both the initial conditions and the parameters of the PDEs. An extensive set of experiments demonstrates that VCNeFs are competitive with and often outperform existing ML-based surrogate models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. LipsFormer: Introducing Lipschitz Continuity to Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: differential attention training stability initialization*\n\n*Xianbiao Qi, Jianan Wang, Yihao Chen, Yukai Shi, Lei Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The experiments show that LipsFormer allows stable training of deep Transformer architectures without the need of careful learning rate tuning such as warmup, yielding a faster convergence and better generalization.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a Lipschitz continuous Transformer, called LipsFormer, to pursue training stability both theoretically and empirically for Transformer-based models. In contrast to previous practical tricks that address training instability by learning rate warmup, layer normalization, attention formulation, and weight initialization, we show that Lipschitz continuity is a more essential property to ensure training stability. In LipsFormer, we replace unstable Transformer component modules with Lipschitz continuous counterparts: CenterNorm instead of LayerNorm, spectral initialization instead of Xavier initialization, scaled cosine similarity attention instead of dot-product attention, and weighted residual shortcut. We prove that these introduced modules are Lipschitz continuous and derive an upper bound on the Lipschitz constant of LipsFormer. Our experiments show that LipsFormer allows stable training of deep Transformer architectures without the need of careful learning rate tuning such as warmup, yielding a faster convergence and better generalization. As a result, on the ImageNet 1K dataset, LipsFormer-Swin-Tiny based on Swin Transformer training for 300 epochs can obtain 82.7\\% without any learning rate warmup. Moreover, LipsFormer-CSwin-Tiny, based on CSwin, training for 300 epochs achieves a top-1 accuracy of 83.5\\% with 4.7G FLOPs and 24M parameters. The code will be released at \\url{https://github.com/IDEA-Research/LipsFormer}.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the training stability of differential attention models in autoregressive language models, several techniques and strategies can be employed, focusing on initialization, normalization, and gradient control.\n\n## Initialization Strategies\n\n### Differential Transformer Initialization\nIn the context of the Differential Transformer (DIFF Transformer), the initialization of the learnable scalar \\( \\lambda \\) is crucial. The paper suggests using an exponential initialization strategy, where \\( \\lambda_{init} = 0.8 - 0.6 \\times \\exp(-0.3 \\cdot (l - 1)) \\), with \\( l \\) being the layer index. This approach helps in maintaining stability across different layers.\n\n### Constant Initialization\nAlternatively, constant initialization strategies can also be effective. For example, setting \\( \\lambda_{init} \\) to a constant value such as 0.8 or 0.5 has been shown to be relatively robust and does not significantly impact the validation loss.\n\n## Normalization Techniques\n\n### Group Normalization\nThe DIFF Transformer employs Group Normalization (GroupNorm) to normalize each attention head independently. This helps in stabilizing the training process by ensuring that the gradient flow aligns with the Transformer architecture. GroupNorm is applied after the differential attention mechanism, which helps in reducing attention noise and maintaining stability.\n\n## Gradient Control Mechanisms\n\n### Differential Attention Mechanism\nThe differential attention mechanism itself is designed to reduce attention noise. By taking the difference between two softmax attention maps, this mechanism cancels out noise and amplifies attention to relevant context. This approach helps in preventing attention entropy collapse and maintains training stability.\n\n### Gradient Flow Alignment\nTo ensure that the gradient flow is aligned with the Transformer architecture, a fixed multiplier \\( (1 - \\lambda_{init}) \\) is applied after GroupNorm. This helps in stabilizing the training process and preventing gradient issues.\n\n## Block-wise Processing and Causality Preservation\n\n### Tiling and Block-wise Processing\nImplementing tiling and block-wise processing strategies can help in maintaining causality while ensuring training stability. This involves handling intra-block and inter-block components separately, which can prevent cumulative summation issues and maintain temporal dependencies.\n\nBy combining these strategies, researchers can significantly improve the training stability of differential attention models in autoregressive language models:\n\n- **Specialized Initialization**: Use exponential or constant initialization for learnable scalars.\n- **Normalization**: Employ Group Normalization to stabilize attention heads.\n- **Gradient Control**: Utilize differential attention mechanisms to reduce noise and align gradient flow.\n- **Block-wise Processing**: Implement tiling and separate intra-block and inter-block computations to maintain causality and stability.\n\nThese techniques are crucial for preventing attention entropy collapse, managing gradients effectively, and ensuring overall training stability.\n",

Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 37/41 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2304.10592, 2023. ## A. Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 3.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits.

Introduction\n\nThe Transformer architecture has achieved widespread adoption, particularly in the domain of large language models\n\n[^0]Preliminary work., Copyright 2024 by the author(s). (LLM) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Peng et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b) and multi-modal models (Li et al., 2022; 2023a; Liu et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b; Lu et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023a; Hao et al., 2024). However, its computational complexity grows quadratically with the length of the input sequence, making it challenging to model extremely long sequences. Unlimited sequence length stands out as a noteworthy aspect within the realm of LLM, attracting considerable attention from researchers who seek intelligent solutions. The potential applications of LLM with unlimited sequence length are diverse, encompassing extended conversations in various professional domains and handling a vast number of tokens in multimodal modeling tasks. In response to the quadratic complexity challenge, a promising resolution emerges in the form of linear attention. This method involves the elimination of the softmax operation and capitalizes on the associativity property of matrix products. Consequently, it significantly accelerates both training and inference procedures. To elaborate, linear attention reduces the computational complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) to compute the attention matrices, where $n$ represents the sequence length. This avenue holds substantial promise for augmenting the efficiency of transformer-style models across a broad spectrum of applications. It is important to note that the notable reduction in complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ in linear attention is only theoretical and may not directly translate to a proportional improvement in computational efficiency on hardware in practice. The realization of practical wall-clock speedup faces challenges, primarily stemming from two issues: 1). the dominance of memory access (I/O) on the GPU could impact the overall computation speed of attention. 2). the cumulative summation (cumsum) needed by the linear attention kernel trick prevents it from reaching its theoretical training speed in the causal setting. The first issue has been successfully addressed by Lightning Attention-1 (Qin et al., 2023b). In this paper, we introduce\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ae38c698417dafba3079g-02.jpg?height=521&width=1709&top_left_y=213&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 1. Speed Showdown: FlashAttention vs. Lightning Attention in Expanding Sequence Lengths and Model Sizes. The diagram above provides a comparative illustration of training speed, Token per GPU per Second (TGS) for LLaMA with FlashAttention-2, TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-1 and TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-2, implemented across three model sizes: 400M, 1B, and 3B from left to right. It is strikingly evident that Lightning Attention-2 manifests a consistent training speed irrespective of the increasing sequence length. Conversely, the other methods significantly decline training speed as the sequence length expands. Lightning Attention-2 to solve the second issue. The key idea is to leverage the concept of \"divide and conquer\" by separately handling the intra block and inter block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, for the intra blocks, we maintain the use of conventional attention computation mechanism to compute the product of QKV, while for the inter blocks, we employ the linear attention kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b). Tiling techniques are implemented in both forward and backward procedures to fully leverage GPU hardware capabilities. As a result, the Lightning Attention-2 can train LLMs with unlimited sequence length without extra cost ${ }^{1}$, as its computational speed remains constant with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of Lightning Attention-2 across a diverse range of sequence lengths to assess its accuracy and compare its computational speed and memory utilization with FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) and Lightning Attention-1. The findings indicate that Lightning Attention-2 exhibits a notable advantage in computational speed, attributed to its innovative intra-inter separation strategy. Additionally, Lightning Attention-2 demonstrates a reduced memory footprint compared to its counterparts without compromising performance. ## 2. Related Work\n\n### 2.1.

However, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in quality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack key properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or \"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly simple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance, but are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a learnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple trainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention. Experiments show Hedgehog recovers over $99 \\%$ of standard Transformer quality in train-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior linear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs, and up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also enables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear attention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText103 for 125 M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model, where prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops. ## 1 Introduction\n\nLinear attentions are promising methods for improving Transformer efficiency. By replacing the softmax of attention's query and key dot products with kernel function feature maps, linear attentions reduce attention's time and space complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d d^{\\prime}\\right)$ where $n$ is sequence length, $d$ is head dimension and $d^{\\prime}$ the feature map dimension (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Xiong et al., 2021; Schlag et al., 2021). For typical Transformer settings, e.g., with head dimension $=64$ and sequence lengths at 512 to 32 K , this quadratic-to-linear scaling can result in significant speed and memory improvements (Fig. 6). As drop-in alternatives to popular softmax attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), linear attentions not only improve Transformer efficiency when training new models from scratch but can also improve inference efficiency by converting pretrained Transformers into corresponding linear variants (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). Linear attention enables efficient Transformers in a variety of regimes:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: training Transformer models with linear attention with the goal of matching standard Transformer performance, e.g., as tested on benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) classification (Tay et al., 2021) and WikiText-103 language modeling (Merity et al., 2017). - Finetuned-conversion: swapping the attentions of task-specific Transformers and finetuning them to convert existing models into linear versions, with the goal to recover original task performance with improved efficiency (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ed734f9b01ac86d7959fg-02.jpg?height=467&width=1625&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=239)\n\nFigure 1: Hedgehog learns a trainable linear attention feature map designed to mimic standard attention, resulting in expressive yet efficient linear attentions for various Transformer training settings\n\n- Pretrained-conversion: doing the same as finetuned-conversion but for pretrained Transformers such as large language models (LLMs), e.g., to transfer to new tasks and longer contexts. Unfortunately, existing linear attention mechanisms typically fail to match softmax attention in modeling quality. When training from scratch, linear attentions achieve 4-6 worse perplexity ( ppl ) than softmax attention on standard benchmarks such as WikiText-103 (Schlag et al., 2021; Irie et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2023), the equivalent gap between 125 M and 255 M Transformers (Dai et al., 2019). When converting finetuned models, linear attention models require additional quadratic attention modules to close the gap (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). One might worry that such gaps are fundamental; for example, recent theory using the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) showed that high-quality truly subquadratic algorithms to approximate softmax attention may be impossible with large sequence length $n$ (Alman \\& Song, 2023; Keles et al., 2023). We begin by empirically studying why this performance gap exists between standard softmax and proposed linear attentions. We identify two simple properties for softmax attention which prior linear attentions lack: 1) low-entropy \"spikyness\" and 2) dot-product monotonicity. We hypothesize that the quality gap in linear attentions corresponds with lacking these two properties:\n\n- Low-entropy \"spikyness\": Intuitively, we want attentions that attend to relevant tokens while ignoring irrelevant ones via their query-key interactions. We observe these low-entropy or \"spiky\" attention-weight distributions in standard Transformer attention but not prior linear attention maps-where spikes enabled via the scaled dot-product softmax are lost via other feature maps (Fig. 2) - and find this strongly corresponds to Transformer performance (Fig. 4). - Dot-product monotonicity: This property requires that attention weights increase as the dot products of their corresponding queries and keys increase. Intuitively, the lack of this monotonicity can produce unstable gradients during training and finetuning, where increasing the query-key dot product can result in decreasing the attention weight the other way (and vice versa). As a first step to recover these properties, we explore simple feature maps - such as low-degree Taylor polynomial approximations to the $\\exp ()$ function - that satisfy the above two properties (albeit in restricted regimes of bounded query-key dot products). In practice, we find that queries and keys are often bounded, resulting in linear attentions that recover softmax attention's spikiness, monotonicity, and subsequent performance. Unfortunately, while technically linear in sequence length, these polynomial feature maps remain inefficient to compute. They take $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{p+1}\\right)$ time and space, and we find degree $p \\geq 2$ necessary for performance. We thus propose Hedgehog, an efficient-to-compute learnable linear attention trained to capture the spiky and monotonic softmax properties. Unlike prior works that propose a specific kernel function (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and our polynomial feature maps, we learn these feature maps as single-layer MLPs specifically trained to match softmax attention weights. By mapping from $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, we maintain prior linear attentions' $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$ complexity. However, training these mappings via softmax attention weights as cross-entropy soft-labels, we find Hedgehog can match softmax attention weights with much higher fidelity (Fig. 7), producing low-entropy and monotonic weights that match standard attention performance quality. We validate experimentally that Hedgehog's improved expressivity translates to closing the softmax attention performance gap in the three regimes mentioned above:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: we find Hedgehog matches Transformers on standard attention benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) (Tay et al., 2021) task, and closes the linear attention gap by $68.6 \\%$ on WikiText-103 language modeling (improving up to 6 ppl ). - Finetuned-conversion: we find Hedgehog recovers $>99 \\%$ of original model performance on average across bidirectional encoder-only 110M BERT-base models finetuned on GLUE and causal decoder-only 125M GPT models finetuned on Wikitext-103. - Pretrained-conversion: we find Hedgehog enables effective transfer to new tasks and efficient scaling to longer contexts, while frequently outperforming modern subquadratic sequence architectures by linearizing existing pretrained Transformers. A 125M Hedgehog-GPT-2 finetuned on Wikitext-103 achieves a new state-of-the-art 16.7 ppl for subquadratic models of the same size. Finally, we demonstrate that Hedgehog can be scaled up to modern large language models; we convert pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves up to 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model. In contrast, prior linear attentions result in models that struggle to produce coherent text (with 16.5 ROUGE-1 point drops). ## 2 Preliminaries and Related Work\n\nWe provide background on attention computation, describe kernel feature based linear attentions, and finally provide details on existing linear attention mechanisms proposed in the literature.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher is focused on developing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block, specifically the **StableLinearAttention (SLA)**, to outperform existing state-of-the-art models.

Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 88/97 (Score: 0.46)*\n\n```\nArXiv, 2112.12731, 2021.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.23)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we introduced Lightning Attention-2, a pioneering implementation of linear attention that effectively harnesses its theoretical computational advantages, particularly in the causal setting. Our approach, which adopts the concepts of \"divide and conquer\" and tiling techniques, successfully addresses the limitations of current linear attention algorithms, especially the challenges associated with cumulative summation. By separating the computation into intrablock and inter-block components, we effectively leverage GPU hardware to its fullest potential, ensuring efficiency. Our extensive experiments across various model sizes and sequence lengths demonstrate that Lightning Attention-2 not only maintains consistent training speeds regardless of input sequence length but also outperforms existing state-ofthe-art attention mechanisms in terms of speed and accuracy. This breakthrough has profound implications for the future of large language models, particularly those requiring the processing of long sequences. Looking ahead, we intend to introduce sequence parallelism in conjunction with Lightning Attention-2, which aims to facilitate the training of extra-long sequences, effectively overcoming existing hardware constraints. ## Acknowledgement\n\nThis work is partially supported by the National Key R\\&D Program of China (NO.2022ZD0160100).

For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/25 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\nVaswani, A., Shazeer, N., Parmar, N., Uszkoreit, J., Jones, L., Gomez, A.

However, their original formulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched transformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to address these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating architectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data and compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is limited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a cost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose Scalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to uptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong pre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring 5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent in-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest linear models.

There are many possible ways to compare attention matrices. Moreover, some architecture changes such as attention decay and lack of normalization in the linear attention make a meaningful comparison difficult. We represent non-normalized comparisons in Figure 3 It represents the cosine similarities and singular value distances between the attention matrices at every layer and for every head of the Mistral model compared with our Mistral-SUPRA. Each pixel of these images is a scalar similarity measure between two matrices represented by a color scale. In Figure 3 , we see large differences between the matrices. Since we removed the attention matrix normalization and replaced it with a LayerNorm Ba et al. (2016), we want to compare normalized attention matrices instead. We divide each line of the matrix by the absolute value of the sum of its elements such that the softmax attention matrix is unaffected and the linear attention matrix is normalized. In Figure 4 , we see significantly higher between most matrices with some exceptions. These observations indicate that the linear attention matrices derived from SUPRA are not an approximation of the softmax matrices. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_e4a87105f8c4def9fb1eg-15.jpg?height=353&width=895&top_left_y=1060&top_left_x=605)\n\nFigure 3: Representation of the cosine similarity and the distance between the singular values of the softmax attention matrices compared to the SUPRA attention matrices. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_e4a87105f8c4def9fb1eg-15.jpg?height=351&width=895&top_left_y=1600&top_left_x=605)\n\nFigure 4: Representation of the cosine similarity and the distance between the singular values of the normalized softmax attention matrices compared to the normalized SUPRA attention matrices.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 11 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: 1.

Stabilizing Transformer Training by Preventing Attention Entropy Collapse\n\n*From Search Query: 1. Stabilizing Linear Attention*\n\n*Shuangfei Zhai, T. Likhomanenko, Etai Littwin, Dan Busbridge, Jason Ramapuram, Yizhe Zhang, Jiatao Gu, J. Susskind*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers, and shows that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training a Vision Transformer without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers.\n\n**Abstract:** Training stability is of great importance to Transformers. In this work, we investigate the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers. In particular, we track the attention entropy for each attention head during the course of training, which is a proxy for model sharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and tasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability, which can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the pathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated attention scores, as $\\textit{entropy collapse}$. As a remedy, we propose $\\sigma$Reparam, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all linear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We demonstrate that $\\sigma$Reparam successfully prevents entropy collapse in the attention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally, we prove a tight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases exponentially fast with the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing additional motivation for our approach. We conduct experiments with $\\sigma$Reparam on image classification, image self-supervised learning, machine translation, speech recognition, and language modeling tasks. We show that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training (a) a Vision Transformer {to competitive performance} without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers; (b) deep architectures in machine translation and (c) speech recognition to competitive performance without warmup and adaptive optimizers.

HyperAttention: Long-context Attention in Near-Linear Time\n\n*From Search Query: 1. Stabilizing Linear Attention*\n\n*Insu Han, Rajesh Jayaram, Amin Karbasi, V. Mirrokni, David P. Woodruff, A. Zandieh*\n\n**TL;DR:** An approximate attention mechanism named HyperAttention is presented to address the computational challenges posed by the growing complexity of long contexts used in Large Language Models, and is able to achieve a linear time sampling algorithm even when the matrix has unbounded entries or a large stable rank.\n\n**Abstract:** We present an approximate attention mechanism named HyperAttention to address the computational challenges posed by the growing complexity of long contexts used in Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent work suggests that in the worst-case scenario, quadratic time is necessary unless the entries of the attention matrix are bounded or the matrix has low stable rank. We introduce two parameters which measure: (1) the max column norm in the normalized attention matrix, and (2) the ratio of row norms in the unnormalized attention matrix after detecting and removing large entries. We use these fine-grained parameters to capture the hardness of the problem. Despite previous lower bounds, we are able to achieve a linear time sampling algorithm even when the matrix has unbounded entries or a large stable rank, provided the above parameters are small. HyperAttention features a modular design that easily accommodates integration of other fast low-level implementations, particularly FlashAttention. Empirically, employing Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to identify large entries, HyperAttention outperforms existing methods, giving significant speed improvements compared to state-of-the-art solutions like FlashAttention. We validate the empirical performance of HyperAttention on a variety of different long-context length datasets. For example, HyperAttention makes the inference time of ChatGLM2 50\\% faster on 32k context length while perplexity increases from 5.6 to 6.3. On larger context length, e.g., 131k, with causal masking, HyperAttention offers 5-fold speedup on a single attention layer.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3. SLAB: Efficient Transformers with Simplified Linear Attention and Progressive Re-parameterized Batch Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: 1. Stabilizing Linear Attention*\n\n*Jialong Guo, Xinghao Chen, Yehui Tang, Yunhe Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel method named PRepBN is proposed to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training and a simplified linear attention (SLA) module is proposed that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have become foundational architectures for both natural language and computer vision tasks. However, the high computational cost makes it quite challenging to deploy on resource-constraint devices. This paper investigates the computational bottleneck modules of efficient transformer, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. LayerNorm is commonly used in transformer architectures but is not computational friendly due to statistic calculation during inference. However, replacing LayerNorm with more efficient BatchNorm in transformer often leads to inferior performance and collapse in training. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named PRepBN to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training. Moreover, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments on image classification as well as object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, our SLAB-Swin obtains $83.6\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with $16.2$ms latency, which is $2.4$ms less than that of Flatten-Swin with $0.1\\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower latency.Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/xinghaochen/SLAB and https://github.com/mindspore-lab/models/tree/master/research/huawei-noah/SLAB.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Object-centric architectures enable efficient causal representation learning\n\n*From Search Query: 2. Blockwise Causal Attention*\n\n*Amin Mansouri, Jason S. Hartford, Yan Zhang, Y. Bengio*\n\n**TL;DR:** An object-centric architecture is developed that leverages weak supervision from sparse perturbations to disentangle each object's properties and it is shown that this approach successfully disentangles the properties of a set of objects in a series of simple image-based disentanglement experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Causal representation learning has showed a variety of settings in which we can disentangle latent variables with identifiability guarantees (up to some reasonable equivalence class). Common to all of these approaches is the assumption that (1) the latent variables are represented as $d$-dimensional vectors, and (2) that the observations are the output of some injective generative function of these latent variables. While these assumptions appear benign, we show that when the observations are of multiple objects, the generative function is no longer injective and disentanglement fails in practice. We can address this failure by combining recent developments in object-centric learning and causal representation learning. By modifying the Slot Attention architecture arXiv:2006.15055, we develop an object-centric architecture that leverages weak supervision from sparse perturbations to disentangle each object's properties. This approach is more data-efficient in the sense that it requires significantly fewer perturbations than a comparable approach that encodes to a Euclidean space and we show that this approach successfully disentangles the properties of a set of objects in a series of simple image-based disentanglement experiments.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

In this paper, we pro-pose a framework to enrich the representation of event pairs by introducing the event causal label information and the event pair interaction information. In particular, 1) we design an event-causal-label-aware module to model the event causal label information, in which we design the event causal label prediction task as an auxiliary task of ECI, aiming to predict which events are involved in the causal relationship (we call them causality-related events) by mining the dependencies between events. 2) We further design an event pair interaction graph module to model the interaction information between event pairs, in which we construct the interaction graph with event pairs as nodes and leverage graph attention mechanism to model the degree of dependency between event pairs. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets EventStoryLine and Causal-TimeBank.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Fast Attention Over Long Sequences With Dynamic Sparse Flash Attention\n\n*From Search Query: 2. Blockwise Causal Attention*\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, F. Fleuret*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention\u2014which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length\u2014becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementation concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attention often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by 2 . 0 \u00d7 and 3 . 3 \u00d7 for sequences of respectively 8 k and 16 k tokens.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. A Customized Text Sanitization Mechanism with Differential Privacy\n\n*From Search Query: 3. Differential Token Processing*\n\n*Hui Chen, Fengran Mo, Yanhao Wang, Cen Chen, J. Nie, Chengyu Wang, Jamie Cui*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Customized Text (CusText) sanitization mechanism based on the original $\\epsilon$-differential privacy (DP) definition, which is compatible with any similarity measure, and achieves a better trade-off between privacy and utility than existing mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** As privacy issues are receiving increasing attention within the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community, numerous methods have been proposed to sanitize texts subject to differential privacy. However, the state-of-the-art text sanitization mechanisms based on metric local differential privacy (MLDP) do not apply to non-metric semantic similarity measures and cannot achieve good trade-offs between privacy and utility. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel Customized Text (CusText) sanitization mechanism based on the original $\\epsilon$-differential privacy (DP) definition, which is compatible with any similarity measure. Furthermore, CusText assigns each input token a customized output set of tokens to provide more advanced privacy protection at the token level. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that CusText achieves a better trade-off between privacy and utility than existing mechanisms.

However, running retrieval-augmented language models (LMs) is slow and difficult to scale due to processing large amounts of retrieved text. We introduce binary token representations (BTR), which use 1-bit vectors to precompute every token in passages, significantly reducing computation during inference. Despite the potential loss of accuracy, our new calibration techniques and training objectives restore performance. Combined with offline and runtime compression, this only requires 127GB of disk space for encoding 3 billion tokens in Wikipedia. Our experiments show that on five knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, BTR accelerates state-of-the-art inference by up to 4x and reduces storage by over 100x while maintaining over 95% task performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. Split-and-Denoise: Protect large language model inference with local differential privacy\n\n*From Search Query: 3. Differential Token Processing*\n\n*Peihua Mai, Ran Yan, Zhe Huang, Youjia Yang, Yan Pang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Split-N-Denoise (SnD) is introduced, an private inference framework that splits the model to execute the token embedding layer on the client side at minimal computational cost, offering clients a privacy-preserving solution for local privacy protection.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language understanding by capturing hidden semantics in vector space. This process enriches the value of text embeddings for various downstream tasks, thereby fostering the Embedding-as-a-Service (EaaS) business model. However, the risk of privacy leakage due to direct text transmission to servers remains a critical concern. To address this, we introduce Split-N-Denoise (SnD), an private inference framework that splits the model to execute the token embedding layer on the client side at minimal computational cost. This allows the client to introduce noise prior to transmitting the embeddings to the server, and subsequently receive and denoise the perturbed output embeddings for downstream tasks. Our approach is designed for the inference stage of LLMs and requires no modifications to the model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate SnD's effectiveness in optimizing the privacy-utility tradeoff across various LLM architectures and diverse downstream tasks. The results reveal an improvement in performance under the same privacy budget compared to the baselines by over 10\\% on average, offering clients a privacy-preserving solution for local privacy protection.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. The Devil in Linear Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: 1. Stabilizing Linear Attention*\n\n*Yiran Zhong, Nick Barnes, Lingpeng Kong, Dongxu Li, Weixuan Sun, Xiaodong Han, Zhen Qin*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear transformers aim to reduce the quadratic space-time complexity of vanilla transformers. However, they usually suffer from degraded performances on various tasks and corpus. In this paper, we examine existing kernel-based linear transformers and identify two key issues that lead to such performance gaps: 1) unbounded gradients in the attention computation adversely impact the convergence of linear transformer models; 2) attention dilution which trivially distributes attention scores over long sequences while neglecting neighbouring structures. To address these issues, we first identify that the scaling of attention matrices is the devil in unbounded gradients, which turns out unnecessary in linear attention as we show theoretically and empirically. To this end, we propose a new linear attention that replaces the scaling operation with a normalization to stabilize gradients. For the issue of attention dilution, we leverage a diagonal attention to confine attention to only neighbouring tokens in early layers. Benefiting from the stable gradients and improved attention, our new linear transformer model, transNormer, demonstrates superior performance on text classification and language modeling tasks, as well as on the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark, surpassing vanilla transformer and existing linear variants by a clear margin while being significantly more space-time efficient.

Differential Token Processing*\n\n*Wei-Ying Ma, Tie-Yan Liu, Jinhui Yuan, Fei Gao, Xun Zheng, Wei Dai, Jinliang Wei, Qirong Ho, Eric P. Xing*\n\n**Abstract:** When building large-scale machine learning (ML) programs, such as big topic\nmodels or deep neural nets, one usually assumes such tasks can only be\nattempted with industrial-sized clusters with thousands of nodes, which are out\nof reach for most practitioners or academic researchers. We consider this\nchallenge in the context of topic modeling on web-scale corpora, and show that\nwith a modest cluster of as few as 8 machines, we can train a topic model with\n1 million topics and a 1-million-word vocabulary (for a total of 1 trillion\nparameters), on a document collection with 200 billion tokens -- a scale not\nyet reported even with thousands of machines. Our major contributions include:\n1) a new, highly efficient O(1) Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm, whose\nrunning cost is (surprisingly) agnostic of model size, and empirically\nconverges nearly an order of magnitude faster than current state-of-the-art\nGibbs samplers; 2) a structure-aware model-parallel scheme, which leverages\ndependencies within the topic model, yielding a sampling strategy that is\nfrugal on machine memory and network communication; 3) a differential\ndata-structure for model storage, which uses separate data structures for high-\nand low-frequency words to allow extremely large models to fit in memory, while\nmaintaining high inference speed; and 4) a bounded asynchronous data-parallel\nscheme, which allows efficient distributed processing of massive data via a\nparameter server. Our distribution strategy is an instance of the\nmodel-and-data-parallel programming model underlying the Petuum framework for\ngeneral distributed ML, and was implemented on top of the Petuum open-source\nsystem. We provide experimental evidence showing how this development puts\nmassive models within reach on a small cluster while still enjoying\nproportional time cost reductions with increasing cluster size, in comparison\nwith alternative options.\n\n**Published:** 2014-12-04\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block, specifically the **StableLinearAttention (SLA)**, here are the key points and useful information that can be leveraged:\n\n## Novelty of Stable Differential Processing\n- The researcher needs to verify if the use of differential token comparison and processing within linear attention is a novel contribution. Current literature, such as the works by Wang et al. (2020) and Katharopoulos et al. (2020), do not address this specific aspect.\n- A deep dive into recent literature (2022-2024) is necessary to ensure no similar methods have been introduced recently. This involves searching for papers that focus on stabilizing attention mechanisms using differential processing.\n\n## Block-wise Computation for Causality Preservation\n- Block-wise computation is a known technique, as seen in the work by Child et al. (2019) on sparse transformers, which uses block sparse attention to maintain causality and efficiency.\n- The novelty here lies in combining block-wise computation with differential processing and specialized initialization. This combination needs to be compared against existing block-wise attention mechanisms to assess its uniqueness.\n\n## Integration of Specialized Initialization and Normalization\n- The use of specialized initialization, group normalization, and gradient control mechanisms to stabilize training is an area that may have limited prior research. Zhai et al. (2023) discuss stabilization techniques in transformer training, which could be relevant, but the specific combination proposed in SLA may still be novel.\n\n## Overlap with Previous Proposals\n- It is crucial to review previous internal proposals like `gpt_2_rsla` and `DiffLinearAttention` to identify any overlaps and clearly articulate the unique contributions of SLA.

Codes and models are available at https://github. com/GATECH-EIC/Linearized-LLM. ## 1. Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n#### 2. Can Mamba Learn How to Learn?

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/37 (Score: 0.66)*\n\n```\nIn fact, Ahn et al. (2023); Mahankali et al. (2023) have provably shown that the global minimum of the linear regression ICL objective implements one step of preconditioned gradient descent for one layer of linear attention. While these settings might appear simplistic and detached from language models, Bhattamishra et al. (2023) showed that a frozen GPT-2 can implement the nearest neighbor algorithm, drawing connections between the ICL in existing language models and the stylized setting of training for ICL from random initialization. Furthermore, Olsson et al. (2022) also empirically demonstrate that \"induction heads\", which are attention heads that solve a simple retrieval problem, correlate with ICL behavior, providing a strong connection between retrieval and ICL. Sub-quadratic architectures. The number of effective floating point operations in an attention layer scales quadratically with respect to the input sequence length. Numerous approximations or alternative model architectures have been proposed to overcome the quadratic dependence. These range from approximating attention mechanisms (Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) to the development of novel recurrent convolutional models such as structured state-space models (Gu et al., 2022b). S4 (Gu et al., 2022a) is a family of sequence models characterized by a discretized state-space model\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbf{x}_{t}, y_{t}=\\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{h}_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{h}_{t}$ represents the hidden state and $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ are input-independent (transformed) parameters. The recurrence is expressible as a convolution, enabling near-linear complexity using Fast Fourier Transform. Viewed in this framework, Linear Transformers (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), which employ linear attention without softmax, can be seen as a variant of linear SSM. Building upon this concept, H3 (Dao et al., 2022) integrates an S4 with dual gated connections. The recent Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) departs from the standard SSM by introducing a selection mechanism that makes $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ in Equation (1) dependent on the input $\\mathbf{x}_{t}$ allowing input-dependent sequence mixing. There are other notable attention-free models such as Hyena (Poli et al., 2023), RWKV (Peng et al., 2023), RetNet (Sun et al., 2023), and GLA (Yang et al., 2023b). Despite of state-of-the-art performance for models like Mamba, Arora et al. (2023) have demonstrated that subquadratic models still lag behind attention on multi-query recall tasks, which is a generalization of the induction head task (Olsson et al., 2022). In their study, Xie et al. (2021) introduced a synthetic language-based dataset for in-context learning, named GINC, and demonstrated that both transformers and LSTMs (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) can perform ICL. Notably, LSTMs outperformed transformers in ICL accuracy on GINC, a finding similar to that found in Liu et al.\n```\n\n#### 3. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg. Score: 0.61)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 47/51 (Score: 0.72)*\n\n```\nZhang, Y. and Cai, D.

Linear attention mechanisms (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) replace $\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{t} \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}^{\\top}\\right)$ with a kernel $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})$ having an associated feature map $\\phi$ (i.e., $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})=\\langle\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\phi(\\boldsymbol{y})\\rangle$ ) where $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{key}}} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{dot}}}$. $\\phi$ often consists of two parts: $\\phi=\\phi_{0} \\circ \\phi_{1}$. $\\phi_{1}$ could be a linear map made up by random samples (Peng et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2021), learnable MLPs (Kasai et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) or simply an identity map (Mao, 2022). $\\phi_{2}$ is often an element-wise (activation) function that makes the resulting $\\phi$ a positive feature map, such as $1+\\mathrm{elu}$ (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), ReLU (Kasai et al., 2021), $\\exp (\\cdot)$ (Zhang et al., 2024; Choromanski et al., 2021). Some work (Qin et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022) suggests that a positive feature map might not be necessary. Our work follows Sun et al. (2023a) and Mao (2022) by using an identity map $\\phi=\\mathbf{I}$. Recent work suggests that non-identity feature maps such as scaled element-wise exponential map (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024) and higher-order polynomial map (Arora et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) work well empirically. We leave the exploration of integrating other types of feature map into GLA to future work. Attention spikiness. Linear attention suffers from the \"attention dilution\" issue (Qin et al., 2022), where the attention distribution is too uniform (i.e., high entropy) to concentrate on relevant tokens. Qin et al. (2022) propose adding local attention layers to focus more on adjacent tokens, a method adopted in (Lingle, 2023; Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023) and proven crucial for performance. Recent work finds that a scaled element-wise exponential map-i.e., $\\phi(\\mathbf{x})=\\exp (t \\cdot \\mathbf{x})$ with $t \\geq 2$-helps to concentrate attention (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). Zhang et al. (2024) also find that higher-order polynomial kernels induce low-entropy and spiky attention distribution, partially explaining the empirical success of Based Linear Attention (Arora et al., 2024) and PolySketchFormer (Kacham et al., 2023). Memory capacity. Linear attention has bounded memory size (Peng et al., 2022) while softmax attention enjoys unbounded memory(Oren et al., 2024). We believe that increasing the memory size efficiently and utilizing memory effectively are the keys to bridging the performance gap between linear attention and softmax attention. To increase memory size, it is shown that directly increasing $d_{\\text {key }}$ is effective (Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022; Zhang \\& Cai, 2022); however, the total parameters are hard to control with the increase of $d_{\\text {key }}$. Parameter-efficient methods often keep $d_{\\text {key }}$ intact and increase $d_{\\text {dot }}$ instead. Higher order polynomial kernels with order $p \\geq 2$ map $d_{\\text {key }}$ to a much higher $d_{\\text {dot }}=O\\left(d_{\\text {key }}^{p}\\right)$ (Arora et al., 2023a; Kacham et al., 2023). Schlag et al. (2021) propose the Deterministic Parameter-Free Projection (DPFP), while Pramanik et al. (2023) use parameterized outer product to expand $d_{\\text {dot }}$ in a parameter-efficient/free manner.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 46/51 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 32, 2019.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.48)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

A Customized Text Sanitization Mechanism with Differential Privacy\n\n*From Search Query: 1. Differential Processing in Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Hui Chen, Fengran Mo, Yanhao Wang, Cen Chen, J. Nie, Chengyu Wang, Jamie Cui*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Customized Text (CusText) sanitization mechanism based on the original $\\epsilon$-differential privacy (DP) definition, which is compatible with any similarity measure, and achieves a better trade-off between privacy and utility than existing mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** As privacy issues are receiving increasing attention within the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community, numerous methods have been proposed to sanitize texts subject to differential privacy. However, the state-of-the-art text sanitization mechanisms based on metric local differential privacy (MLDP) do not apply to non-metric semantic similarity measures and cannot achieve good trade-offs between privacy and utility. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel Customized Text (CusText) sanitization mechanism based on the original $\\epsilon$-differential privacy (DP) definition, which is compatible with any similarity measure. Furthermore, CusText assigns each input token a customized output set of tokens to provide more advanced privacy protection at the token level. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that CusText achieves a better trade-off between privacy and utility than existing mechanisms.

We show that recent results on linear causal attention (Choromanski et al., 2021) and log-linear RPE-attention (Luo et al., 2021) are special cases of this general mechanism. However by casting the problem as a topological (graph-based) modulation of unmasked attention, we obtain several results unknown before, including efficient d-dimensional RPE-masking and graph-kernel masking. We leverage many mathematical techniques ranging from spectral analysis through dynamic programming and random walks to new algorithms for solving Markov processes on graphs.

Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: 1.

Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: 2. Specialized Initialization in Linear Attention*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: it replaces the softmax activation with a ReLU, and shows that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5. On the Role of Attention in Prompt-tuning\n\n*From Search Query: 2. Specialized Initialization in Linear Attention*\n\n*Samet Oymak, A. Rawat, M.

Despite its success in LLMs, there is limited theoretical understanding of the power of prompt-tuning and the role of the attention mechanism in prompting. In this work, we explore prompt-tuning for one-layer attention architectures and study contextual mixture-models where each input token belongs to a context-relevant or -irrelevant set. We isolate the role of prompt-tuning through a self-contained prompt-attention model. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We show that softmax-prompt-attention is provably more expressive than softmax-self-attention and linear-prompt-attention under our contextual data model. (2) We analyze the initial trajectory of gradient descent and show that it learns the prompt and prediction head with near-optimal sample complexity and demonstrate how prompt can provably attend to sparse context-relevant tokens. (3) Assuming a known prompt but an unknown prediction head, we characterize the exact finite sample performance of prompt-attention which reveals the fundamental performance limits and the precise benefit of the context information. We also provide experiments that verify our theoretical insights on real datasets and demonstrate how prompt-tuning enables the model to attend to context-relevant information.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6. LEMON: Reviving Stronger and Smaller LMs from Larger LMs with Linear Parameter Fusion\n\n*From Search Query: 2. Specialized Initialization in Linear Attention*\n\n*Yilong Chen, Junyuan Shang, Zhenyu Zhang, Shiyao Cui, Tingwen Liu, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun, Hua Wu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes L EMON to learn competent initial points for smaller models by fusing parameters from larger models, thereby laying a solid foundation for subsequent training and demonstrates that the fusion-based method exhibits flexibility and outperforms a series of competitive baselines in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** In the new era of language models, small models (with billions of parameter sizes) are receiving increasing attention due to their flexibility and cost-effectiveness in deployment. However, limited by the model size, the performance of small models trained from scratch may often be unsatisfactory. Learning a stronger and smaller model with the help of larger models is an intuitive idea. Inspired by the observing modular structures in preliminary analysis, we pro-pose L EMON to learn competent initial points for smaller models by fusing parameters from larger models, thereby laying a solid foundation for subsequent training. Specifically, the parameter fusion process involves two operators for layer and dimension, respectively, and we also introduce controllable receptive fields to model the prior parameter characteristics. In this way, the larger model could be transformed into any specific smaller scale and architecture. Starting from LLaMA 2-7B, we revive two stronger and smaller models with 1.3B and 2.7B. Experimental results demonstrate that the fusion-based method exhibits flexibility and outperforms a series of competitive baselines in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Pose Recognition with Cascade Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: 1. Differential Processing in Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Zhuowen Tu, Weijian Xu, Yifan Xu, Xiang Zhang, Shijie Wang, Ke Li*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a regression-based pose recognition method using cascade Transformers. One way to categorize the existing approaches in this domain is to separate them into 1). heatmap-based and 2). regression-based. In general, heatmap-based methods achieve higher accuracy but are subject to various heuristic designs (not end-to-end mostly), whereas regression-based approaches attain relatively lower accuracy but they have less intermediate non-differentiable steps. Here we utilize the encoder-decoder structure in Transformers to perform regression-based person and keypoint detection that is general-purpose and requires less heuristic design compared with the existing approaches. We demonstrate the keypoint hypothesis (query) refinement process across different self-attention layers to reveal the recursive self-attention mechanism in Transformers. In the experiments, we report competitive results for pose recognition when compared with the competing regression-based methods.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-14\n\n\n\n#### 2. 1-Diffractor: Efficient and Utility-Preserving Text Obfuscation Leveraging Word-Level Metric Differential Privacy\n\n*From Search Query: 1. Differential Processing in Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Florian Matthes, Maulik Chevli, Stephen Meisenbacher*\n\n**Abstract:** The study of privacy-preserving Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained rising attention in recent years. One promising avenue studies the integration of Differential Privacy in NLP, which has brought about innovative methods in a variety of application settings. Of particular note are $\\textit{word-level Metric Local Differential Privacy (MLDP)}$ mechanisms, which work to obfuscate potentially sensitive input text by performing word-by-word $\\textit{perturbations}$. Although these methods have shown promising results in empirical tests, there are two major drawbacks: (1) the inevitable loss of utility due to addition of noise, and (2) the computational expensiveness of running these mechanisms on high-dimensional word embeddings. In this work, we aim to address these challenges by proposing $\\texttt{1-Diffractor}$, a new mechanism that boasts high speedups in comparison to previous mechanisms, while still demonstrating strong utility- and privacy-preserving capabilities. We evaluate $\\texttt{1-Diffractor}$ for utility on several NLP tasks, for theoretical and task-based privacy, and for efficiency in terms of speed and memory. $\\texttt{1-Diffractor}$ shows significant improvements in efficiency, while still maintaining competitive utility and privacy scores across all conducted comparative tests against previous MLDP mechanisms.

NBC2: Multichannel Speech Separation with Revised Narrow-band Conformer\n\n*From Search Query: 3. Group Normalization in Transformers*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** This work proposes a multichannel narrow-band speech separation network. In the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain, the proposed network processes each frequency independently, and all frequencies use a shared network. For each frequency, the network performs end-to-end speech separation, namely taking as input the STFT coefficients of microphone signals, and predicting the separated STFT coefficients of multiple speakers. The proposed network learns to cluster the frame-wise spatial/steering vectors that belong to different speakers. It is mainly composed of three components. First, a self-attention network. Clustering of spatial vectors shares a similar principle with the self-attention mechanism in the sense of computing the similarity of vectors and then aggregating similar vectors. Second, a convolutional feed-forward network. The convolutional layers are employed for signal smoothing and reverberation processing. Third, a novel hidden-layer normalization method, i.e. group batch normalization (GBN), is especially designed for the proposed narrow-band network to maintain the distribution of hidden units over frequencies. Overall, the proposed network is named NBC2, as it is a revised version of our previous NBC (narrow-band conformer) network. Experiments show that 1) the proposed network outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, 2) the proposed GBN improves the signal-to-distortion ratio by 3 dB, relative to other normalization methods, such as batch/layer/group normalization, 3) the proposed narrow-band network is spectrum-agnostic, as it does not learn spectral patterns, and 4) the proposed network is indeed performing frame clustering (demonstrated by the attention maps).\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-05\n\n\n\n#### 4. Pose-Transformed Equivariant Network for 3D Point Trajectory Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: 3. Group Normalization in Transformers*\n\n*Jian Sun, Ruixuan Yu*\n\n**Abstract:**     Predicting 3D point trajectory is a fundamental learning task which commonly should be equivariant under Euclidean transformation e.g. SE(3). The existing equivariant models are commonly based on the group equivariant convolution equivariant message passing vector neuron frame averaging etc. In this paper we propose a novel pose-transformed equivariant network in which the points are firstly uniquely normalized and then transformed by the learned pose transformations upon which the points after motion are predicted and aggregated. Under each transformed pose we design the point position predictor consisting of multiple Pose-Transformed Points Prediction blocks in which the global and local motions are estimated and aggregated. This framework can be proven to be equivariant to SE(3) transformation over 3D points. We evaluate the pose-transformed equivariant network on extensive datasets including human motion capture molecular dynamics modeling and dynamics simulation. Extensive experimental comparisons demonstrated our SOTA performance compared with the existing equivariant networks for 3D point trajectory prediction.    \n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2024-1\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, here are the key insights and useful information gathered from the provided analysis and references:\n\n## Novelty Assessment and Differentiation\n\n- The proposal's integration of **stable differential token processing** within linear attention, combined with **block-wise computation** for causality preservation, **specialized initialization**, **group normalization**, and **gradient control mechanisms**, needs to be clearly differentiated from existing methods.\n  - The \"Differential Transformer\" paper introduces a differential attention mechanism that uses a pair of softmax functions to cancel noise in attention scores, which is a novel approach but needs to be distinguished from the proposal's methods.\n  - The failed **DiffLinearAttention** proposal also used differential comparisons, so the current proposal must highlight advancements or unique approaches to this concept.\n\n## Training Stability and Normalization Techniques\n\n- **Training Stability:**\n  - The use of **group normalization** and **gradient control mechanisms** in the proposal aligns with efforts to stabilize transformer training, as seen in Zhai et al.

In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/41 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2308.16137, 2023.

Score: 0.94)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 5. Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg. Score: 0.85)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

However, their quadratic computational complexity poses a major obstacle for applying them to vision tasks requiring dense predictions, such as object detection, feature matching, stereo, etc. We introduce QuadTree Attention, which reduces the computational complexity from quadratic to linear. Our quadtree transformer builds token pyramids and computes attention in a coarse-to-fine manner. At each level, the top K patches with the highest attention scores are selected, such that at the next level, attention is only evaluated within the relevant regions corresponding to these top K patches. We demonstrate that quadtree attention achieves state-of-the-art performance in various vision tasks, e.g. with 4.0% improvement in feature matching on ScanNet, about 50% flops reduction in stereo matching, 0.4-1.5% improvement in top-1 accuracy on ImageNet classification, 1.2-1.8% improvement on COCO object detection, and 0.7-2.4% improvement on semantic segmentation over previous state-of-the-art transformers.

However, the high computational cost makes it quite challenging to deploy on resource-constraint devices. This paper investigates the computational bottleneck modules of efficient transformer, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. LayerNorm is commonly used in transformer architectures but is not computational friendly due to statistic calculation during inference. However, replacing LayerNorm with more efficient BatchNorm in transformer often leads to inferior performance and collapse in training. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named PRepBN to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training. Moreover, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments on image classification as well as object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, our SLAB-Swin obtains $83.6\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with $16.2$ms latency, which is $2.4$ms less than that of Flatten-Swin with $0.1\\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower latency.Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/xinghaochen/SLAB and https://github.com/mindspore-lab/models/tree/master/research/huawei-noah/SLAB.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: 2. Training Stability Techniques for Linear Attention*\n\n*Haoran You, Yichao Fu, Zheng Wang, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Y. Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Stable and low-precision training for large-scale vision-language models\n\n*From Search Query: 2. Training Stability Techniques for Linear Attention*\n\n*Mitchell Wortsman, Tim Dettmers, Luke Zettlemoyer, Ari S. Morcos, Ali Farhadi, Ludwig Schmidt*\n\n**TL;DR:** SwitchBack is introduced, a linear layer for int8 quantized training which provides a speed-up of 13-25% while matching the performance of bfloat16 training within 0.1 percentage points for the 1B parameter CLIP ViT-Huge -- the largest int8 training to date.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce new methods for 1) accelerating and 2) stabilizing training for large language-vision models. 1) For acceleration, we introduce SwitchBack, a linear layer for int8 quantized training which provides a speed-up of 13-25% while matching the performance of bfloat16 training within 0.1 percentage points for the 1B parameter CLIP ViT-Huge -- the largest int8 training to date. Our main focus is int8 as GPU support for float8 is rare, though we also analyze float8 training through simulation. While SwitchBack proves effective for float8, we show that standard techniques are also successful if the network is trained and initialized so that large feature magnitudes are discouraged, which we accomplish via layer-scale initialized with zeros. 2) For stability, we analyze loss spikes and find they consistently occur 1-8 iterations after the squared gradients become under-estimated by their AdamW second moment estimator. As a result, we recommend an AdamW-Adafactor hybrid which avoids loss spikes when training a CLIP ViT-Huge model and outperforms gradient clipping at the scales we test.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 6. PolySketchFormer: Fast Transformers via Sketching Polynomial Kernels\n\n*From Search Query: 2. Training Stability Techniques for Linear Attention*\n\n*Praneeth Kacham, V. Mirrokni, Peilin Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper demonstrates that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality, and develops polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic time and memory complexity inherent to self-attention mechanisms, with respect to sequence length, presents a critical computational bottleneck in the training and deployment of large-scale Transformer-based language models. Recent theoretical results indicate the intractability of sub-quadratic softmax attention approximation under reasonable complexity assumptions. This paper addresses this challenge by first demonstrating that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality. Next, we develop polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees. Crucially, our approach achieves this speedup without requiring the sparsification of attention matrices. We also present a block-based algorithm to apply causal masking efficiently. Combining these techniques, we provide \\emph{PolySketchFormer}, a practical linear-time Transformer architecture for language modeling that offers provable guarantees. We validate PolySketchFormer empirically by training language models capable of handling long contexts. These experiments utilize both synthetic and real-world datasets (PG19, Wikipedia and C4) on Google Cloud TPUs. For context lengths of 32k and GPT-2 style models, our model achieves a 2.5-4x speedup in training compared to FlashAttention, with no observed degradation in quality across our experiments.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Robust (Controlled) Table-to-Text Generation with Structure-Aware Equivariance Learning\n\n*From Search Query: 1. Differential Attention in Linear Transformers*\n\n*Muhao Chen, Pedro Szekely, Zhewei Xu, Fei Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Controlled table-to-text generation seeks to generate natural language descriptions for highlighted subparts of a table. Previous SOTA systems still employ a sequence-to-sequence generation method, which merely captures the table as a linear structure and is brittle when table layouts change. We seek to go beyond this paradigm by (1) effectively expressing the relations of content pieces in the table, and (2) making our model robust to content-invariant structural transformations. Accordingly, we propose an equivariance learning framework, which encodes tables with a structure-aware self-attention mechanism. This prunes the full self-attention structure into an order-invariant graph attention that captures the connected graph structure of cells belonging to the same row or column, and it differentiates between relevant cells and irrelevant cells from the structural perspective. Our framework also modifies the positional encoding mechanism to preserve the relative position of tokens in the same cell but enforce position invariance among different cells. Our technology is free to be plugged into existing table-to-text generation models, and has improved T5-based models to offer better performance on ToTTo and HiTab. Moreover, on a harder version of ToTTo, we preserve promising performance, while previous SOTA systems, even with transformation-based data augmentation, have seen significant performance drops.

Analyzing Vision Transformers for Image Classification in Class Embedding Space\n\n*From Search Query: 1. Differential Attention in Linear Transformers*\n\n*Gemma Roig, Timothy Schauml\u00f6ffel, Martina G. Vilas*\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the growing use of transformer models in computer vision, a mechanistic understanding of these networks is still needed. This work introduces a method to reverse-engineer Vision Transformers trained to solve image classification tasks. Inspired by previous research in NLP, we demonstrate how the inner representations at any level of the hierarchy can be projected onto the learned class embedding space to uncover how these networks build categorical representations for their predictions. We use our framework to show how image tokens develop class-specific representations that depend on attention mechanisms and contextual information, and give insights on how self-attention and MLP layers differentially contribute to this categorical composition. We additionally demonstrate that this method (1) can be used to determine the parts of an image that would be important for detecting the class of interest, and (2) exhibits significant advantages over traditional linear probing approaches. Taken together, our results position our proposed framework as a powerful tool for mechanistic interpretability and explainability research.\n\n**Conference:** analyzing-vision-transformers-for-image\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, here are the key insights and useful information gathered from the analysis note and the provided sources:\n\n## Novelty Assessment and Differentiation\n\n- The proposal focuses on integrating **differential token processing** within linear attention, which appears to be a novel approach given the current literature. The researcher needs to clearly differentiate this proposal from previous internal proposals like **DiffLinearAttention** by highlighting advancements, improvements, or unique approaches that address past concerns such as causality preservation and computational overhead.\n\n## Specialized Initialization and Group Normalization\n\n- The use of **exponential initialization** for differential parameters combined with **group normalization** is a potentially novel approach for stabilizing training in linear attention models. This combination is not directly addressed in existing works, suggesting an opportunity for innovation. The Differential Transformer paper provides insights into using group normalization and specialized initialization, which could be relevant here.\n\n## Gradient Control Mechanisms\n\n- The proposal's emphasis on **gradient control** to prevent attention entropy collapse aligns with recent research efforts, such as those by Zhai et al. (2023). However, the unique approach to gradient control in the proposal could contribute to improved training stability if effectively implemented. The Differential Transformer also discusses maintaining gradient flow similar to traditional Transformers, which could be useful.\n\n## Causality Preservation and Block-wise Computation\n\n- Ensuring **causality** in autoregressive models with block-wise computation and differential processing is critical. The researcher should detail strategies, possibly inspired by methods in **FlashAttention** or **Dynamic Sparse Flash Attention**, to ensure causal dependencies are preserved. The Differential Transformer's architecture, which stacks layers with differential attention and feed-forward networks, provides a framework that could be adapted to maintain causality.\n\n## Information Flow and Attention Mechanisms\n\n- Understanding the **information flow dynamics** within Transformers, as described in the PDE-inspired formulation, can provide insights into how information propagates through the layers. This can help in optimizing attention mechanisms and ensuring robustness to input perturbations.\n\n## Key Components for Effective Information Flow\n\n- The use of **self-attention mechanisms**, **multi-head attention**, and **feedforward networks** in Transformers is crucial for capturing long-range dependencies and enriching the information processed at each layer. The Differential Transformer's use of differential attention and feed-forward networks can enhance these capabilities.\n\n## Implementation and Efficiency\n\n- The proposal needs to address **implementation complexity** and ensure that the additional computations do not offset efficiency gains. Detailed analysis is required to substantiate claims of improved efficiency. The paper on Differential Transformer discusses aligning parameter counts and computational complexity, which could be helpful in this regard.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n- Conduct a **deep dive into internal proposals** like **DiffLinearAttention**, **`gpt_2_rsla`**, and **`adaptivekvmetatransformer`** to identify overlaps and unique contributions.\n- **Investigate recent advances** (2023-2024) on differential processing in attention mechanisms, specialized initialization techniques in linear attention, and the use of group normalization and gradient control for stabilizing transformer models.\n- **Assess implementation challenges** and explore strategies for integrating differential processing with block-wise computation while preserving causality.\n\n### Relevant Sources\n\n- **Differential Transformer**: This paper introduces a novel architecture using differential attention, which replaces conventional softmax attention. It also discusses the use of group normalization and specialized initialization, aligning with the researcher's goals.\n- **Understanding Nonlinear Transformers**: This source provides insights into the mathematical modeling of token embeddings as continuous fields, which can help in optimizing attention mechanisms and understanding information flow within Transformers.\n- **Improving Systematic Generalization of Linear Transformer**: This work discusses the limitations and potential improvements of linear attention mechanisms, which can be relevant for addressing the concerns raised in the proposal.\n\nBy focusing on these areas and leveraging the insights from the provided sources, the researcher can develop a comprehensive and novel autoregressive LM block that addresses the key challenges and improves upon existing state-of-the-art models.\n",

By integrating specialized initialization, group normalization, and gradient control mechanisms, SLA achieves improved expressiveness and stability while maintaining linear computational complexity.
