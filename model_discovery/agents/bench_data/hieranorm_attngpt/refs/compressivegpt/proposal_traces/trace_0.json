However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/35 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAlbert Gu, Karan Goel, and Christopher R\u00e9. 2021.

Recurrent Memory Transformer (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded. Memory Layers (Lample et al, 2019) model has a product key memory layer instead of a feed-forward layer within Transformer block to increase model capacity.\n```\n\n#### 3. Near-Lossless Acceleration of Long Context LLM Inference with Adaptive Structured Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Qianchao Zhu, Jiangfei Duan, Chang Chen, Siran Liu, Xiuhong Li, Guanyu Feng, Xin Lv, Huanqi Cao, Chuanfu Xiao, Xingcheng Zhang, Dahua Lin, Chao Yang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention, which can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\\times compared with FlashAttention.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) now support extremely long context windows, but the quadratic complexity of vanilla attention results in significantly long Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) latency. Existing approaches to address this complexity require additional pretraining or finetuning, and often sacrifice model accuracy. In this paper, we first provide both theoretical and empirical foundations for near-lossless sparse attention. We find dynamically capturing head-specific sparse patterns at runtime with low overhead is crucial. To address this, we propose SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention. Leveraging observed significant sparse patterns, SampleAttention attends to a fixed percentage of adjacent tokens to capture local window patterns, and employs a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering approach, which adaptively select a minimum set of key-values with low overhead, to capture column stripe patterns. Comprehensive evaluations show that SampleAttention can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\\times$ compared with FlashAttention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/25 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2312.11805, 2023.

Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to $4000 x$ faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models were originally introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017) in the context of neural machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015) and have demonstrated impressive results on a variety of tasks dealing with natural language (Devlin et al., 2019), audio (Sperber et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2019). Apart from tasks with ample supervision, transformers are also effective in transferring knowledge to tasks with limited or no supervision when they are pretrained with autoregressive (Radford et al., 2018; 2019) or masked language modeling objectives (Devlin et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020). However, these benefits often come with a very high computational and memory cost. The bottleneck is mainly caused\n\n[^0]by the global receptive field of self-attention, which processes contexts of $N$ inputs with a quadratic memory and time complexity $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{2}\\right)$. As a result, in practice transformers are slow to train and their context is limited. This disrupts temporal coherence and hinders the capturing of long-term dependencies. Dai et al. (2019) addressed the latter by attending to memories from previous contexts albeit at the expense of computational efficiency. Lately, researchers shifted their attention to approaches that increase the context length without sacrificing efficiency. Towards this end, Child et al. (2019) introduced sparse factorizations of the attention matrix to reduce the selfattention complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\sqrt{N})$. Kitaev et al. (2020) further reduced the complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$ using localitysensitive hashing. This made scaling to long sequences possible. Even though the aforementioned models can be efficiently trained on large sequences, they do not speed-up autoregressive inference. In this paper, we introduce the linear transformer model that significantly reduces the memory footprint and scales linearly with respect to the context length. We achieve this by using a kernel-based formulation of self-attention and the associative property of matrix products to calculate the self-attention weights (\u00a7 3.2). Using our linear formulation, we also express causal masking with linear complexity and constant memory (\u00a73.3). This reveals the relation between transformers and RNNs, which enables us to perform autoregressive inference orders of magnitude faster (\u00a7 3.4). Our evaluation on image generation and automatic speech recognition demonstrates that linear transformer can reach the performance levels of transformer, while being up to three orders of magnitude faster during inference. ## 2. Related Work\n\nIn this section, we provide an overview of the most relevant works that seek to address the large memory and computational requirements of transformers. Furthermore, we discuss methods that theoretically analyze the core component of the transformer model, namely self-attention. Finally, we present another line of work that seeks to alleviate the softmax bottleneck in the attention computation. ### 2.1. Efficient Transformers\n\nExisting works seek to improve memory efficiency in transformers through weight pruning (Michel et al., 2019), weight factorization (Lan et al., 2020), weight quantization (Zafrir et al., 2019) or knowledge distillation. Clark et al. (2020) proposed a new pretraining objective called replaced token detection that is more sample efficient and reduces the overall computation. Lample et al. (2019) used product-key attention to increase the capacity of any layer with negligible computational overhead. Reducing the memory or computational requirements with these methods leads to training or inference time speedups, but, fundamentally, the time complexity is still quadratic with respect to the sequence length which hinders scaling to long sequences. In contrast, we show that our method reduces both memory and time complexity of transformers both theoretically ( $\\S 3.2$ ) and empirically (\u00a7 4.1). Another line of research aims at increasing the \"context\" of self-attention in transformers. Context refers to the maximum part of the sequence that is used for computing selfattention. Dai et al. (2019) introduced Transformer-XL which achieves state-of-the-art in language modeling by learning dependencies beyond a fixed length context without disrupting the temporal coherence. However, maintaining previous contexts in memory introduces significant additional computational cost. In contrast, Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) extended the context length significantly by learning the optimal attention span per attention head, while maintaining control over the memory footprint and computation time. Note that both approaches have the same asymptotic complexity as the vanilla model. In contrast, we improve the asymptotic complexity of the self-attention, which allows us to use significantly larger context. More related to our model are the works of Child et al.\n```\n\n#### 5.

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/48 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nJayakumar, Chloe Hillier, and Timothy P.

Representing Long-Range Context for Graph Neural Networks with Global Attention\n\n*From Search Query: long context transformer architecture*\n\n*Zhanghao Wu, Paras Jain, Matthew A. Wright, Azalia Mirhoseini, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Ion Stoica*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the use of Transformer-based self-attention to learn long-range pairwise relationships, with a novel readout mechanism to obtain a global graph embedding, and suggests that purely-learning-based approaches without graph structure may be suitable for learning high-level, long- range relationships on graphs.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks are powerful architectures for structured datasets. However, current methods struggle to represent long-range dependencies. Scaling the depth or width of GNNs is insufficient to broaden receptive fields as larger GNNs encounter optimization instabilities such as vanishing gradients and representation oversmoothing, while pooling-based approaches have yet to become as universally useful as in computer vision. In this work, we propose the use of Transformer-based self-attention to learn long-range pairwise relationships, with a novel\"readout\"mechanism to obtain a global graph embedding. Inspired by recent computer vision results that find position-invariant attention performant in learning long-range relationships, our method, which we call GraphTrans, applies a permutation-invariant Transformer module after a standard GNN module. This simple architecture leads to state-of-the-art results on several graph classification tasks, outperforming methods that explicitly encode graph structure. Our results suggest that purely-learning-based approaches without graph structure may be suitable for learning high-level, long-range relationships on graphs.

Though the Transformer architecture has fundamentally no limits on the input sequence lengths it can process, the choice of position encoding used during training can limit the performance of these models on longer inputs. We propose a novel functional relative position encoding with progressive interpolation, FIRE, to improve Transformer generalization to longer contexts. We theoretically prove that this can represent some of the popular relative position encodings, such as T5\u2019s RPE, Alibi, and Kerple. We next empirically show that FIRE models have better generalization to longer contexts on both zero-shot language modeling and long text benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 28  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3. Long-Short Term Masking Transformer: A Simple but Effective Baseline for Document-level Neural Machine Translation\n\n*From Search Query: long context transformer architecture*\n\n*Pei Zhang, Boxing Chen, Niyu Ge, Kai Fan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a surprisingly simple long-short term masking self-attention on top of the standard transformer to both effectively capture the long-range dependence and reduce the propagation of errors.\n\n**Abstract:** Many document-level neural machine translation (NMT) systems have explored the utility of context-aware architecture, usually requiring an increasing number of parameters and computational complexity. However, few attention is paid to the baseline model. In this paper, we research extensively the pros and cons of the standard transformer in document-level translation, and find that the auto-regressive property can simultaneously bring both the advantage of the consistency and the disadvantage of error accumulation. Therefore, we propose a surprisingly simple long-short term masking self-attention on top of the standard transformer to both effectively capture the long-range dependence and reduce the propagation of errors. We examine our approach on the two publicly available document-level datasets. We can achieve a strong result in BLEU and capture discourse phenomena.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 31  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4. Entroformer: A Transformer-based Entropy Model for Learned Image Compression\n\n*From Search Query: long context transformer architecture*\n\n*Yichen Qian, Ming Lin, Xiuyu Sun, Zhiyu Tan, Rong Jin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel transformer-based entropy model, termed Entroformer, to capture long-range dependencies in probability distribution estimation effectively and efficiently and achieves state-of-the-art performance on image compression while being time-efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** One critical component in lossy deep image compression is the entropy model, which predicts the probability distribution of the quantized latent representation in the encoding and decoding modules. Previous works build entropy models upon convolutional neural networks which are inefficient in capturing global dependencies. In this work, we propose a novel transformer-based entropy model, termed Entroformer, to capture long-range dependencies in probability distribution estimation effectively and efficiently. Different from vision transformers in image classification, the Entroformer is highly optimized for image compression, including a top-k self-attention and a diamond relative position encoding. Meanwhile, we further expand this architecture with a parallel bidirectional context model to speed up the decoding process. The experiments show that the Entroformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on image compression while being time-efficient.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 107  (*Influential: 26*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Advancing Transformer Architecture in Long-Context Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey\n\n*From Search Query: long context transformer architecture*\n\n*Penghao Zhao, Shupeng Li, Hao Chen, Zenan Li, Taolue Chen, Xiaoxing Ma, Lijuan Yang, Yuan YAO, Junyu Lai, Zixu Jiang, Jingwei Xu, Yunpeng Huang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied in diverse areas such as knowledge bases, human interfaces, and dynamic agents, and marking a stride towards achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, current LLMs are predominantly pretrained on short text snippets, which compromises their effectiveness in processing the long-context prompts that are frequently encountered in practical scenarios. This article offers a comprehensive survey of the recent advancement in Transformer-based LLM architectures aimed at enhancing the long-context capabilities of LLMs throughout the entire model lifecycle, from pre-training through to inference. We first delineate and analyze the problems of handling long-context input and output with the current Transformer-based models. We then provide a taxonomy and the landscape of upgrades on Transformer architecture to solve these problems. Afterwards, we provide an investigation on wildly used evaluation necessities tailored for long-context LLMs, including datasets, metrics, and baseline models, as well as optimization toolkits such as libraries, frameworks, and compilers to boost the efficacy of LLMs across different stages in runtime. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential avenues for future research.

Transformer-XL: Attentive Language Models Beyond a Fixed-Length Context\n\n*From Search Query: long context transformer architecture*\n\n*Jaime Carbonell, Quoc V. Le, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Zihang Dai, Zhilin Yang, Yiming Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have a potential of learning longer-term dependency, but are limited by a fixed-length context in the setting of language modeling. We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens. Our code, pretrained models, and hyperparameters are available in both Tensorflow and PyTorch.\n\n**Conference:** transformer-xl-attentive-language-models-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-09\n\n\n\n#### 3. Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: long context transformer architecture*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are quickly becoming one of the most heavily applied deep learning architectures across modalities, domains, and tasks. In vision, on top of ongoing efforts into plain transformers, hierarchical transformers have also gained significant attention, thanks to their performance and easy integration into existing frameworks. These models typically employ localized attention mechanisms, such as the sliding-window Neighborhood Attention (NA) or Swin Transformer's Shifted Window Self Attention. While effective at reducing self attention's quadratic complexity, local attention weakens two of the most desirable properties of self attention: long range inter-dependency modeling, and global receptive field. In this paper, we introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), a natural, flexible and efficient extension to NA that can capture more global context and expand receptive fields exponentially at no additional cost. NA's local attention and DiNA's sparse global attention complement each other, and therefore we introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer (DiNAT), a new hierarchical vision transformer built upon both. DiNAT variants enjoy significant improvements over strong baselines such as NAT, Swin, and ConvNeXt. Our large model is faster and ahead of its Swin counterpart by 1.6% box AP in COCO object detection, 1.4% mask AP in COCO instance segmentation, and 1.4% mIoU in ADE20K semantic segmentation. Paired with new frameworks, our large variant is the new state of the art panoptic segmentation model on COCO (58.5 PQ) and ADE20K (49.4 PQ), and instance segmentation model on Cityscapes (45.1 AP) and ADE20K (35.4 AP) (no extra data). It also matches the state of the art specialized semantic segmentation models on ADE20K (58.1 mIoU), and ranks second on Cityscapes (84.5 mIoU) (no extra data).\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly for handling long sequences efficiently, here are some recent innovations and techniques that align with your analysis and goals:\n\n## Attention Mechanisms for Long Sequences\n\n### Differential Attention Mechanism\nThe DIFF Transformer, introduced by Microsoft and Tsinghua University, enhances attention mechanisms by comparing two separate attention maps. This differential attention helps the model focus more effectively on relevant parts of the input, improving accuracy in tasks like question answering and text summarization. It also handles longer sequences efficiently and reduces activation outliers, making it suitable for low-resource environments.\n\n### Sparse Attention Mechanisms\nTechniques like sparse attention mechanisms can significantly reduce computational complexity. For example, models can attend to only a subset of the input at each layer, or use hierarchical approaches to process the input at multiple levels of granularity. This approach helps in handling longer sequences without the quadratic complexity associated with traditional attention mechanisms.\n\n### Grouped Query Attention and Multi-Query Attention\nInnovative attention mechanisms such as Grouped Query Attention and Multi-Query Attention reduce the complexity of attention calculations. Grouped Query Attention groups inputs to lower the computation from quadratic to linear, while Multi-Query Attention allows multiple queries within a single attention head, enhancing the model\u2019s ability to gather and process diverse information.\n\n## Memory Efficiency and Computational Complexity\n\n### Hierarchical Processing\nHierarchical processing is a recurring theme for handling complexity in long sequences. Models like Hyena Hierarchy use implicit parametrization and long convolutions, interleaved with data-controlled gating, to achieve subquadratic complexity. This approach sets a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures and can be combined with hierarchical attention mechanisms for improved efficiency[Analysis Note, \"Hyena Hierarchy\"].\n\n### LinearGPT and Other Efficient Architectures\nThe LinearGPT (lgpt) model reduces the dimension of the decoder blocks as the embedding of a token passes through the architecture, inspired by the continuous downsampling in CNNs. This approach maintains performance while reducing the parameter count and computational overhead, making it more efficient for handling long sequences.\n\n### Relative Positional Encoding\nTechniques like relative positional encoding enhance the model\u2019s ability to handle longer sequences by understanding the relationships between tokens based on their relative positions rather than absolute positions. This allows transformers to generalize better to sequences of varying lengths.\n\n## State Space Models and Linear Attention\n\n### Simplified Transformer Architectures\nResearch on reducing the transformer architecture to a minimum suggests that omitting certain components, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and collapsing query, key, and value matrices can significantly reduce the parameter set size without hurting performance. Symmetric similarity measures can also reduce the number of parameters required.\n\n### Linear Attention Mechanisms\nLinear attention mechanisms, such as those used in the LinearGPT model, reduce the computational complexity by reducing the dimension of the decoder blocks as the token embedding passes through the architecture. This approach maintains performance while reducing the computational and memory requirements.\n\n## Hierarchical Structures\n\n### Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\nCombining hierarchical processing with attention mechanisms can offer significant efficiency benefits. Hierarchical models process the input at multiple levels of granularity, allowing for selective computation and compression, which helps in maintaining O(n) or better complexity for long sequences[Analysis Note, \"Hierarchical processing\"].\n\n### Multi-Modal and Hybrid Models\nWhile not directly focused on text, the integration of transformers with other architectures (like CNNs in computer vision) shows promise. Hybrid models can leverage the strengths of different approaches, such as using CNNs for initial feature extraction and transformers for higher-level reasoning. This combination can be adapted for text models to handle long sequences more efficiently.\n\nBy incorporating these innovations\u2014differential attention, sparse and grouped query attention, hierarchical processing, linear attention mechanisms, and simplified transformer architectures\u2014the researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models capable of handling long sequences effectively.\n",

Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to $4000 x$ faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models were originally introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017) in the context of neural machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015) and have demonstrated impressive results on a variety of tasks dealing with natural language (Devlin et al., 2019), audio (Sperber et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2019). Apart from tasks with ample supervision, transformers are also effective in transferring knowledge to tasks with limited or no supervision when they are pretrained with autoregressive (Radford et al., 2018; 2019) or masked language modeling objectives (Devlin et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020). However, these benefits often come with a very high computational and memory cost. The bottleneck is mainly caused\n\n[^0]by the global receptive field of self-attention, which processes contexts of $N$ inputs with a quadratic memory and time complexity $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{2}\\right)$. As a result, in practice transformers are slow to train and their context is limited. This disrupts temporal coherence and hinders the capturing of long-term dependencies. Dai et al. (2019) addressed the latter by attending to memories from previous contexts albeit at the expense of computational efficiency. Lately, researchers shifted their attention to approaches that increase the context length without sacrificing efficiency. Towards this end, Child et al. (2019) introduced sparse factorizations of the attention matrix to reduce the selfattention complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\sqrt{N})$. Kitaev et al. (2020) further reduced the complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$ using localitysensitive hashing. This made scaling to long sequences possible. Even though the aforementioned models can be efficiently trained on large sequences, they do not speed-up autoregressive inference. In this paper, we introduce the linear transformer model that significantly reduces the memory footprint and scales linearly with respect to the context length. We achieve this by using a kernel-based formulation of self-attention and the associative property of matrix products to calculate the self-attention weights (\u00a7 3.2). Using our linear formulation, we also express causal masking with linear complexity and constant memory (\u00a73.3). This reveals the relation between transformers and RNNs, which enables us to perform autoregressive inference orders of magnitude faster (\u00a7 3.4). Our evaluation on image generation and automatic speech recognition demonstrates that linear transformer can reach the performance levels of transformer, while being up to three orders of magnitude faster during inference. ## 2. Related Work\n\nIn this section, we provide an overview of the most relevant works that seek to address the large memory and computational requirements of transformers. Furthermore, we discuss methods that theoretically analyze the core component of the transformer model, namely self-attention. Finally, we present another line of work that seeks to alleviate the softmax bottleneck in the attention computation. ### 2.1. Efficient Transformers\n\nExisting works seek to improve memory efficiency in transformers through weight pruning (Michel et al., 2019), weight factorization (Lan et al., 2020), weight quantization (Zafrir et al., 2019) or knowledge distillation. Clark et al. (2020) proposed a new pretraining objective called replaced token detection that is more sample efficient and reduces the overall computation. Lample et al. (2019) used product-key attention to increase the capacity of any layer with negligible computational overhead. Reducing the memory or computational requirements with these methods leads to training or inference time speedups, but, fundamentally, the time complexity is still quadratic with respect to the sequence length which hinders scaling to long sequences. In contrast, we show that our method reduces both memory and time complexity of transformers both theoretically ( $\\S 3.2$ ) and empirically (\u00a7 4.1). Another line of research aims at increasing the \"context\" of self-attention in transformers. Context refers to the maximum part of the sequence that is used for computing selfattention. Dai et al. (2019) introduced Transformer-XL which achieves state-of-the-art in language modeling by learning dependencies beyond a fixed length context without disrupting the temporal coherence. However, maintaining previous contexts in memory introduces significant additional computational cost. In contrast, Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) extended the context length significantly by learning the optimal attention span per attention head, while maintaining control over the memory footprint and computation time. Note that both approaches have the same asymptotic complexity as the vanilla model. In contrast, we improve the asymptotic complexity of the self-attention, which allows us to use significantly larger context. More related to our model are the works of Child et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. \u221e-former: Infinite Memory Transformer (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Pedro Henrique Martins, Zita Marinho, Andr\u00e9 F. T.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

This scalability fuels a trend analogous to Moore's law, which links increased model size to performance gains [39]. The effectiveness of attention in text sequence processing was solidified through the Transformer paper. Models like BERT [16] and GPT-3 [33] further showcased the scalability of Transformer and its tendency for improved performance with increased model size. Following the replacement of LSTM [5] by Transformer in most Natural Language Processing (NLP) domains, the Vision Transformer (ViT) [32] replaced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [4] with Transformers in the vision domain, and Conformer (Convolution-augmented Transformer) [29] replaced LSTM in the speech domain. The Transformer has become the de facto architecture in various domains. Currently, attention serves as the leading architecture for extracting meaningful representations from homogeneous data. The logical progression points toward extending attention capabilities to heterogeneous data. This has enabled advances in multimodal fusion (text and vision), as seen in models like DALL$\\cdot$E 2 [55], Flamingo [54] and CoCa [53]. AudioLM [64] has shown that attention also excels at fusing audio and text. Consequently, Gemini [69] integrates text, images, audio, and video into a single generative model. This was possible because attention to heterogeneous data works exceptionally well. Despite the impressive success of attention, it suffers from major drawbacks. Firstly, attention has quadratic complexity with respect to context length, which limits the capability of modeling long contexts. Secondly, it forgets information from context before attention window, unlike LSTM, which theoretically can propagate information indefinitely. We want the better architecture to be able to process arbitrarily long sequences efficiently, while preserving very long-term dependencies. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_364db6cf7554a04db2efg-02.jpg?height=407&width=1404&top_left_y=232&top_left_x=361)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of query-key attention masks for Sliding Window Attention (SWA) variants.

Linearizing Transformer with Key-Value Memory\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmentation transformer kernel*\n\n*Yizhe Zhang, Deng Cai*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that Memsizer provides an improved balance between efficiency and accuracy over the vanilla transformer and other efficient transformer variants in three typical sequence generation tasks, including machine translation, abstractive text summarization, and language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient transformer variants with linear time complexity have been developed to mitigate the quadratic computational overhead of the vanilla transformer. Among them are low-rank projection methods such as Linformer and kernel-based Transformers. Despite their unique merits, they usually suffer from a performance drop comparing with the vanilla transformer on many sequence generation tasks, and often fail to obtain computation gain when the generation is short. We propose Memsizer, an approach towards closing the performance gap while improving the efficiency even with short generation. It projects the source sequences into lower dimension representations like Linformer, while enjoying efficient recurrent-style incremental computation similar to kernel-based transformers. This yields linear computation time and constant memory complexity at inference time. Memsizer also employs a lightweight multi-head mechanism which renders the computation as light as a single-head model. We demonstrate that Memsizer provides an improved balance between efficiency and accuracy over the vanilla transformer and other efficient transformer variants in three typical sequence generation tasks, including machine translation, abstractive text summarization, and language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. KDEformer: Accelerating Transformers via Kernel Density Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmentation transformer kernel*\n\n*A. Zandieh, Insu Han, Majid Daliri, Amin Karbasi*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed KDEformer can approximate the attention in sub-quadratic time with provable spectral norm bounds, while all prior results merely provide entry-wise error bounds, and outperforms other attention approximations in terms of accuracy, memory, and runtime on various pre-trained models.\n\n**Abstract:** Dot-product attention mechanism plays a crucial role in modern deep architectures (e.g., Transformer) for sequence modeling, however, na\\\"ive exact computation of this model incurs quadratic time and memory complexities in sequence length, hindering the training of long-sequence models. Critical bottlenecks are due to the computation of partition functions in the denominator of softmax function as well as the multiplication of the softmax matrix with the matrix of values. Our key observation is that the former can be reduced to a variant of the kernel density estimation (KDE) problem, and an efficient KDE solver can be further utilized to accelerate the latter via subsampling-based fast matrix products. Our proposed KDEformer can approximate the attention in sub-quadratic time with provable spectral norm bounds, while all prior results merely provide entry-wise error bounds. Empirically, we verify that KDEformer outperforms other attention approximations in terms of accuracy, memory, and runtime on various pre-trained models. On BigGAN image generation, we achieve better generative scores than the exact computation with over $4\\times$ speedup. For ImageNet classification with T2T-ViT, KDEformer shows over $18\\times$ speedup while the accuracy drop is less than $0.5\\%$.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 3. SOFT: Softmax-free Transformer with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmentation transformer kernel*\n\n*Jiachen Lu, Jinghan Yao, Junge Zhang, Xiatian Zhu, Hang Xu, Weiguo Gao, Chunjing Xu, T. Xiang, Li Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** For the first time, a softmax-free transformer or SOFT is proposed, which significantly improves the computational efficiency of existing ViT variants and allows much longer token sequences to be permitted in SOFT, resulting in superior trade-off between accuracy and complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers (ViTs) have pushed the state-of-the-art for various visual recognition tasks by patch-wise image tokenization followed by self-attention. However, the employment of self-attention modules results in a quadratic complexity in both computation and memory usage. Various attempts on approximating the self-attention computation with linear complexity have been made in Natural Language Processing. However, an in-depth analysis in this work shows that they are either theoretically flawed or empirically ineffective for visual recognition. We further identify that their limitations are rooted in keeping the softmax self-attention during approximations. Specifically, conventional self-attention is computed by normalizing the scaled dot-product between token feature vectors. Keeping this softmax operation challenges any subsequent linearization efforts. Based on this insight, for the first time, a softmax-free transformer or SOFT is proposed. To remove softmax in self-attention, Gaussian kernel function is used to replace the dot-product similarity without further normalization. This enables a full self-attention matrix to be approximated via a low-rank matrix decomposition. The robustness of the approximation is achieved by calculating its Moore-Penrose inverse using a Newton-Raphson method. Extensive experiments on ImageNet show that our SOFT significantly improves the computational efficiency of existing ViT variants. Crucially, with a linear complexity, much longer token sequences are permitted in SOFT, resulting in superior trade-off between accuracy and complexity.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 132  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 4. CoDA: Contrast-enhanced and Diversity-promoting Data Augmentation for Natural Language Understanding\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmentation transformer kernel*\n\n*Yanru Qu, Dinghan Shen, Yelong Shen, Sandra Sajeev, Jiawei Han, Weizhu Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel data augmentation framework dubbed CoDA is proposed, which synthesizes diverse and informative augmented examples by integrating multiple transformations organically by introducing a contrastive regularization objective to capture the global relationship among all the data samples.\n\n**Abstract:** Data augmentation has been demonstrated as an effective strategy for improving model generalization and data efficiency. However, due to the discrete nature of natural language, designing label-preserving transformations for text data tends to be more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation framework dubbed CoDA, which synthesizes diverse and informative augmented examples by integrating multiple transformations organically. Moreover, a contrastive regularization objective is introduced to capture the global relationship among all the data samples. A momentum encoder along with a memory bank is further leveraged to better estimate the contrastive loss. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we apply CoDA to Transformer-based models on a wide range of natural language understanding tasks. On the GLUE benchmark, CoDA gives rise to an average improvement of 2.2% while applied to the RoBERTa-large model. More importantly, it consistently exhibits stronger results relative to several competitive data augmentation and adversarial training base-lines (including the low-resource settings). Extensive experiments show that the proposed contrastive objective can be flexibly combined with various data augmentation approaches to further boost their performance, highlighting the wide applicability of the CoDA framework.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 60  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5. A Linear Time and Space Local Point Cloud Geometry Encoder via Vectorized Kernel Mixture (VecKM)\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmentation transformer kernel*\n\n*Dehao Yuan, Cornelia Fermuller, Tahseen Rabbani, Furong Huang, Y. Aloimonos*\n\n**TL;DR:** In classification and segmentation tasks, integrating VecKM as a preprocessing module achieves consistently better performance than the PointNet, PointNet++, and point transformer baselines, and runs consistently faster by up to 10 times.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose VecKM, a local point cloud geometry encoder that is descriptive and efficient to compute. VecKM leverages a unique approach by vectorizing a kernel mixture to represent the local point cloud. Such representation's descriptiveness is supported by two theorems that validate its ability to reconstruct and preserve the similarity of the local shape. Unlike existing encoders downsampling the local point cloud, VecKM constructs the local geometry encoding using all neighboring points, producing a more descriptive encoding. Moreover, VecKM is efficient to compute and scalable to large point cloud inputs: VecKM reduces the memory cost from $(n^2+nKd)$ to $(nd+np)$; and reduces the major runtime cost from computing $nK$ MLPs to $n$ MLPs, where $n$ is the size of the point cloud, $K$ is the neighborhood size, $d$ is the encoding dimension, and $p$ is a marginal factor. The efficiency is due to VecKM's unique factorizable property that eliminates the need of explicitly grouping points into neighbors. In the normal estimation task, VecKM demonstrates not only 100x faster inference speed but also highest accuracy and strongest robustness. In classification and segmentation tasks, integrating VecKM as a preprocessing module achieves consistently better performance than the PointNet, PointNet++, and point transformer baselines, and runs consistently faster by up to 10 times.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmentation transformer kernel*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Karan Goel, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of $10000$ or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) \\( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \\), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix \\( A \\), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning \\( A \\) with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91\\% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation $60\\times$ faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors.\n\n**Conference:** efficiently-modeling-long-sequences-with\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-31\n\n\n\n#### 2. Feature Structure Distillation with Centered Kernel Alignment in BERT Transferring\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmentation transformer kernel*\n\n*Kangil Kim, Seung-Hoon Na, Doyeon Kim, Hee-Jun Jung*\n\n**Abstract:** Knowledge distillation is an approach to transfer information on representations from a teacher to a student by reducing their difference. A challenge of this approach is to reduce the flexibility of the student's representations inducing inaccurate learning of the teacher's knowledge. To resolve it in transferring, we investigate distillation of structures of representations specified to three types: intra-feature, local inter-feature, global inter-feature structures. To transfer them, we introduce feature structure distillation methods based on the Centered Kernel Alignment, which assigns a consistent value to similar features structures and reveals more informative relations. In particular, a memory-augmented transfer method with clustering is implemented for the global structures. The methods are empirically analyzed on the nine tasks for language understanding of the GLUE dataset with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), which is a representative neural language model. In the results, the proposed methods effectively transfer the three types of structures and improve performance compared to state-of-the-art distillation methods. Indeed, the code for the methods is available in https://github.com/maroo-sky/FSD.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on memory augmentation techniques and kernel methods for efficient attention computation and long sequence processing, here are some key insights and relevant information:\n\n## Memory Augmentation Techniques\n\n### Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs)\nThe introduction of NAMMs as described in the paper \"An Evolved Universal Transformer Memory\" offers significant improvements in both performance and efficiency. NAMMs are designed to manage the memory of transformers directly, allowing for distinct contexts to be provided to each latent level independently. This approach reduces the number of retained tokens in the KV cache, leading to substantial efficiency benefits while exceeding the performance of full-context models. NAMMs also demonstrate zero-shot transferability across different transformer models and input modalities, which is crucial for scalability and adaptability.\n\n### Adaptive Compression and Structured Sparsity\nTechniques such as adaptive compression and structured sparsity patterns can be integrated into memory augmentation. For instance, methods like SampleAttention, which leverages sparse patterns and employs a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering approach, can efficiently capture local window patterns while reducing computational complexity.\n\n## Kernel Methods for Attention Computation\n\n### Linear Attention Mechanisms\nKernel-based formulations, such as linear attention mechanisms, can significantly reduce the computational complexity of self-attention from \\(O(n^2)\\) to \\(O(n)\\). This is achieved by expressing self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps, utilizing the associativity property of matrix products. Such linear transformers can achieve performance similar to vanilla transformers but are much faster, especially in autoregressive prediction scenarios.\n\n### Efficient Kernel-Based Formulations\nThe use of kernel methods in attention computation can be further optimized by employing efficient kernel-based formulations. For example, the \"Transformers are RNNs\" paper shows how kernel feature maps can be used to speed up attention computation, making the model up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction tasks.\n\n## Integration with State Space Models and Hierarchical Processing\n\n### State Space Models\nState space models (SSMs) can be integrated with attention mechanisms to handle long sequences efficiently. The SPADE model, for instance, augments an SSM into the bottom layer and uses efficient local attention methods for other layers, combining the strengths of both local and global processing.\n\n### Hierarchical Processing\nHierarchical structures, such as those used in the Swin Transformer, can effectively capture both local and global dependencies across different spatial resolutions. This approach involves dividing the input into non-overlapping windows or patches and applying self-attention independently within each window, which is particularly beneficial for long sequence processing and scalability.\n\n## Technical Considerations and Implementation Strategies\n\n### Balancing Efficiency and Expressiveness\nWhen implementing these techniques, it is crucial to balance computational efficiency with model expressiveness. This involves maintaining model capacity while reducing complexity, often through adaptive mechanisms that can handle varying sequence lengths.\n\n### Two-Stage Processing\nTwo-stage processing, combining local and global attention, can be an effective strategy. This approach can leverage kernel-based attention formulations and structured sparse attention patterns to optimize both efficiency and performance.\n\nBy integrating these memory augmentation techniques, kernel methods for attention computation, and hierarchical processing strategies, researchers can significantly improve the efficiency, scalability, and performance of autoregressive language models, especially in handling long sequences.\n",

We demonstrate on a variety of benchmarks in language modeling, machine translation, and reinforcement learning that the increased representation capacity can create small, shallow models with much stronger performance than comparable Transformers. ## 1 INTRODUCTION\n\nIn recent years, the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al, 2017) has brought large improvements to a wide range of Natural Language Processing tasks such as machine translation, sentence representation (Devlin et al., 2019), and summarization (Edunov et al., 2019). Transformers are also successfully used as an autoregressive model on sequential tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al. 2019, Rae et al, 2020) and reinforcement learning (Parisotto et al., 2019). Unlike more traditional recurrent architectures such as RNNs and LSTMs, the Transformer architecture processes a sequence in parallel in an order-invariant way. Techniques such as position embeddings (Sukhbaatar et al. 2015, Shaw et al. 2018) and attention masking are required to capture input order information. In this work, we focus on several limitations of the Transformer architecture as an autoregressive model and present a straightforward solution - Feedback memory. These limitations and our proposed solution target sequential token prediction tasks, such as language modeling or other auto-regressive generative tasks. The feedforward nature of Transformers makes them efficient on modern hardware, but restricts the Transformer from taking full advantage of the input's sequential property. In particular, the current hidden representation of a Transformer only accesses the past representations of lower layers, even though higher level representations of the past have already been computed as an autoregressive model. At generation, the Transformer generates only one token at a time, so it could access these representations for better performance, but does not exploit these at training time due to parallelization. However, if these past higher level representations could be used at training time, they would enrich future lower level representations, enabling shallower models to have the same representation power. Another inherent limitation of Transformers on sequential tasks is the lack of recursive computation (Dehghani et al., 2018), and the number of transformations possible on the input is bounded by the model depth. Such disadvantages have impact on tasks that require careful tracking of a world state or modeling hierarchical structures (Tran et al., 2018; Hahn, 2020). On the other hand, while RNNs can maintain an internal state for an unbounded time while accumulating more computations upon it, the size of this internal state is limited by the dimension of the hidden state. In this work, we propose a novel autoregressive model, the Feedback Transformer, that makes all previous hidden representations accessible to the computation of a representation at any depth -\nthe model feeds back previous computations to itself. The feedback allows the model to perform recursive computation, building stronger representations iteratively upon previous states. To achieve this, we modify self-attention to attend to higher level representations rather than lower ones. As shown in Figure 1, the Feedback Transformer merges the hidden states from all layers into a single vector for every time step and stores them in a memory. Instead of self-attention, all subsequent layers attend to this memory, which means every previously computed representation is accessible by all future layers, mediated by the memory. This allows Feedback Transformers to recursively compute and transform an input as many times as the input length, which is something Transformers cannot achieve. While RNNs can perform recursive computation, the amount of information that Feedback Transformers can maintain is not limited by the number of layers. There are computational benefits to this straightforward modification. First, it uses less memory because all the layers share a single Feedback memory, thus reducing the memory size by $L$ times, where $L$ is the number of layers. There is also less computation because we share the key and value projections during attention computation, which increases the speed of the attention over the Feedback Memory. Further, the GPU memory usage is reduced due to the memory sharing - the overall model is 2 x smaller - allowing the batch size to be increased for computational efficiency. During inference, the increased batch size contributes to substantially faster decoding speeds. In summary, our main contributions are: (1) The Feedback Transformer architecture, which completely changes the way a Transformer works to access available higher level representations immediately. (2) We show the Feedback Transformer can achieve state of the art results with smaller, shallower models that have faster decoding speed and smaller memory footprint. (3) The Feedback Transformer uses substantially less memory during training and inference time. ## 2 RELATED WORK\n\nSeveral previous works have analyzed the limitations of Transformer architectures, such as the inability to process input sequentially (Dehghani et al. 2018) or represent hierarchical structure (Tran et al., 2018). Hahn (2020) demonstrate that Transformers cannot model structures involving bounded recursion, such as closing parentheses. P\u00e9rez et al. (2019) study Transformers in the context of Turing machines, where they must produce unbounded numbers of decoding steps. Various work in probing Transformers identified several limitations where Transformers may not have the computational capacity of recurrent architecture like an LSTM (Hahn, 2020). From the architectural perspective, our work shares similarities with recurrent networks augmented with external shared memories (Graves et al., 2014; Joulin \\& Mikolov, 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015). For example, the stack augmented RNN of Joulin \\& Mikolov(2015) adds an external memory to a recurrent network to keep long term dependencies. Closer to our work, the Neural Turing Machine of Graves et al. (2014) models an unconstrained memory that resembles the self-attention layer of a Transformer. Further improvements to recurrent networks, such as the Gated Feedback RNN (Chung et al., 2015), are based on better controlling signal from different layers and extended to feedback through multiple pathways (Jin et al., 2017). These works are built on recurrent networks with additional components to store long term dependencies. Other works have studied modifications to the Transformer architecture by enriching its structure with components inspired by recurrent networks. For example, Wang et al. (2019) propose adding a local recurrent sublayer to the Transformer layer to remove the need for position embeddings in the multi-head self-attention layers. Universal Transformer (Dehghani et al., 2018) share the parameters between the layers of a Transformer, leading a recurrent network in depth.\n```\n\n#### 2. LoMA: Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Yumeng Wang, Zhenyang Xiao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA) is introduced, a novel approach that enables lossless compression of the KV cache, thereby reducing the memory and computational demands during autoregressive generation.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations due to the high demand on GPU memory and computational resources when handling long contexts. While sparsify the Key-Value (KV) cache of transformer model is a typical strategy to alleviate resource usage, it unavoidably results in the loss of information. We introduce Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), a novel approach that enables lossless compression of the KV cache, thereby reducing the memory and computational demands during autoregressive generation. LoMA incorporates a specialized training or fine-tuning precedure alongside an autoregressive generation algorithm optimized for the compressed context. Our method compresses the KV cache after every $tc$ generated tokens with a compression ratio of $c$ and a target compressed length $t$, and this process occurs within a single inference pass without dependency on auxiliary models. We engineered an efficient training scheme involving specific inputs, attention masks, and position identifiers to instill this compression capability. Experimental validation has demonstrated that LoMA significantly reducing computational consumption and memory usage through achieving lossless KV cache compression.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/16 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nA comprehensive code listing detailing the aforementioned steps is presented in Appendix A. ### 3.2. Performance analysis\n\nIn this analysis, we evaluated the extent to which LoMA reduces the computational and storage resource requirements. Without loss of generality, we compared the standard autoregressive generation algorithm with the LoMA generation in the absence of prompts. Let $T_{\\text {infer }}(l, k)$ denote the time it takes for the model to complete one inference on a token sequence of length $l$ with a key-value (KV) cache of length $k$. Assuming the total generation spans $m$ chunks, each consisting of $t c$ tokens, the generation time for a traditional transformer is given by:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{m t c-1} T_{\\text {infer }}(1, k)\n$$\n\nUnder a preset compression ratio $c$ and memory length $t$, LoMA performs one inference every $t c$ tokens with $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens, resulting in a total generation time of:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{y=0}^{m} \\sum_{k=y t}^{y t+t c-1} T_{\\text {infer }}(1, k)+m T_{\\text {infer }}(t c, t)\n$$\n\nTypically, $T_{\\text {infer }}(l, k)$ is much less than $l T_{\\text {infer }}(1, k)$. Our tests conducted on an A100 GPU demonstrate this point, see Fig. 2. Consequently, even though the additional term $m T_{\\text {infer }}(t c, t)$ of the LoMA generation process slightly increases the computation, the significant compression of the KV cache results in a notable reduction in both generation time and memory usage, as illustrated in the table 1. ## 4. Training\n\nTo equip the transformer model with the aforementioned memory compression capability, pre-training or fine-tuning procedures are essential. We have devised a training procedure that includes structured reorganization of input samples, a novel loss terms, a unique design attention mask, and a specialized pattern of PositionIDs. ### 4.1. Input Samples\n\nIn the training procedure of LoMA, the original sequence of tokens is segmented into multiple subsequences each of length $t c$. To each subsequence, $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens followed by $t c$ '<r>' tokens are appended, forming a training chunk. All training chunks are concatenated to form a new structured sequence as a training sample. see Fig 3. ### 4.2. Loss\n\nTo train a Transformer model using the structured input sequence mentioned above, it is necessary to extend the vanilla loss $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{LM}}$ with an additional term that endows the model with the capability to compress memory. Since the output of model on the memory zone is not of concern, with the KV-cache in this zone being utilized to store compressed information, there is no need to design labels or a loss function for the memory zone. Indirectly, the memory zone is supervised through the loss applied to the repetition zone. Consequently, the training loss for each chunk is calculated as the sum of these two components, and the total loss across all chunks is determined by:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}=\\sum_{y=1}^{m}\\left(\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Read }}^{y}+\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Rep }}^{y}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Read }}^{y}$ is the loss generated by the reading zone of the $y$-th training chunk while $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Rep }}^{y}$ corresponds to the loss produced by the repetition zone. Let the token subsequence from the reading zone be denoted as $\\operatorname{READ}_{y}=\\left\\{x_{k}, x_{k+1}, \\ldots, x_{k+t c}\\right\\}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Read }}^{y}=\\sum_{i=k}^{k+t c} \\mathrm{CE}\\left(M\\left(x_{i}\\right), x_{i+1}\\right)\n$$\n\nis same with the standard trainning loss and\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{REP}}^{y}=\\sum_{i=k}^{k+t c} \\mathrm{CE}\\left(M\\left({ }^{\\prime}<\\mathrm{r}>^{\\prime}{ }_{i+t(c+1)}\\right), x_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{CE}($ logits, label) refers to the standard cross-entropy loss function, and the $M(x)$ is the set of logits produced\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-04.jpg?height=324&width=836&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=1054)\n\nFigure 4: This figure describes the correspondence between inputs and labels. In reading zone, the input and target exhibit a standard autoregressive relationship. No labels are set in the memory zone, while the labels in the repetition zone consist of content from the reading zone. We demonstrated in Section.4.4 that by backpropagating gradients through the repetition zone, a supervisory signal can be provided to the memory zone. This allows the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' token to learn to compress the content of the reading zone into its own KV . by the model $M$ for the token $x$. The term ' $<\\mathrm{r}>{ }^{\\prime}{ }_{k+t(c+1)}$ refers to the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token at position $k+t(c+1)$, indicating that the model's prediction for each ' $<$ r>' token should be identical with the corresponding token in the reading zone.\n```\n\n#### 3. Memformer: A Memory-Augmented Transformer for Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.90)\n\n*Qingyang Wu, Zhenzhong Lan, Kun Qian, Jing Gu, A.

However, these models have efficiency issues as they need to store all the history token-level representations as memory. We present Memformer, an efficient neural network for sequence modeling, that utilizes an external dynamic memory to encode and retrieve past information. Our model achieves linear time complexity and constant memory space complexity when processing long sequences. We also propose a new optimization scheme, memory replay back-propagation (MRBP), which promotes long-range back-propagation through time with a significantly reduced memory requirement. Experimental results show that Memformer has achieved comparable performance compared to the baselines by using 8.1x less memory space and 3.2x faster on inference. Analysis of the attention pattern shows that our external memory slots can encode and retain important information through timesteps.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nTransformers have achieved great success in various natural language processing tasks. Nevertheless, the quadratic computation complexity can be costly. Some works try to address the limitations of selfattention, including Reformer, Sparse Transformer, Longformer, Linformer (Child et al., 2019; Kitaev et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), etc. They successfully reduce the complexity of self-attention and thus enable processing longer sequences. However, most of them still require linear memory space complexity. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) re-introduces the concept of memory and recurrence. It caches each layer's hidden states of self-attention into a fixed-size queue and re-uses them in the later attention computation. However, the memory as raw hidden states cannot effectively compress highlevel information. Thus, Transformer-XL in practice needs a massive memory size to perform well, and spends huge computation in using its memory. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) improves upon Transformer-XL by further compressing its memories into fewer vectors via a compression network. However, as mentioned in the papers, both Transformer-XL and Compressive Transformer discard the information from the distant past, which causes a theoretical maximum tempo-\nral range given the fixed memory size. Inspired by the previous external memory networks, we propose Memformer, which incorporates a fixed-size external dynamic memory combined with the recent Transformer architecture. Memformer interacts with its external dynamic memory through the memory reading and writing modules. Also, we introduce a forgetting mechanism to improve the effectiveness of memorizing new information. By utilizing recurrence and a fixedsize memory, our model has a theoretically infinite temporal range of memorization and implies a linear computation complexity and constant memory space complexity. As the traditional backpropagation through time (BPTT) has an unaffordable memory cost in our model, we introduce a new optimization scheme, memory replay backpropagation (MRBP), to significantly reduce the memory cost in training recurrent neural networks with large size of memory representations. We evaluate Memformer on the autoregressive image generation and language modeling task. Experimental results show that Memformer performs on par with Transformer and Transformer XL with large memory size, while being much more efficient in terms of computation speed and memory space consumption. We also conduct an analysis showing that Memformer can retain information for an extended period. ## 2 Related Work\n\nThis section introduces some recent research directions that aim to alleviate the quadratic cost of selfattention. Moreover, we analyze their assumptions and limitations under the autoregressive setting to provide a broader view of these models. ### 2.1 Sparse Attention\n\nOne influential direction is to replace the full selfattention with sparse attention patterns to speed up the computation. Child et al. (2019) proposed Sparse Transformer, using a block sparse attention pattern to reduce the computation complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\sqrt{N})$. Later, Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020) and Big Bird (Zaheer et al., 2020) further explored this direction and proposed an even more sparse attention pattern to reduce the cost to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$. They introduced global tokens to encode the information from the entire sequence and kept the selfattention to the closest $k$ tokens and the global tokens to achieve linear complexity. Although linear sparse attention's theoretical soundness is proven for bidirectional encoders, it does not hold for the decoder. The main reason is that the global tokens cannot leak information to the future tokens in the autoregressive setting, where all the tokens can only see their previous tokens. Thus, linear sparse attention cannot guarantee a token to see its all past tokens. Only Sparse Transformer here with $\\mathcal{O}(N \\sqrt{N})$ complexity can theoretically cover all the past tokens for the sequence generation. ### 2.2 Linear Attention\n\nAnother direction is focusing on improving the softmax operation in the self-attention. Linformer (Wang et al., 2020) reduced the complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ by projecting the entire sequence to a constant size of keys and values, but this method has not been applied to autoregressive decoding. Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) used a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps to replace softmax. However, for Linear Transformer under the autoregressive setting, it needs to compute the cumulative summation to aggregate the history information. This assumption is too strong if the input sequence is long and the length is not fixed. After thousands of steps, the numerical values can become very large due to the summation, causing overflow and gradient instability. ### 2.3 Recurrence and Memory\n\nApplying recurrence and memory to Transformers is an orthogonal direction comparing to the efficient attention approaches. If the memory size is constant, recurrence enables the model to have constant memory complexity during inference. There are mainly two works exploring this direction. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) used relative positional encoding and consisted of a segmentlevel recurrence mechanism to encode beyond a fixed-length context. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) extended from Transformer-XL by further compressing the previous cached hidden states to achieve a longer context. However, using past hidden states as memory would cause a theoretical maximum temporal range of context, meaning that a token is not guaranteed to see all the past tokens. Thus, in practice, Transformer-XL and Compressive Transformer need huge memory size to achieve good performance. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_a5b0bfb29582fd0f4766g-03.jpg?height=915&width=717&top_left_y=225&top_left_x=224)\n\nFigure 1: Memformer overall architecture for the encoder (left) and decoder (right). Transformer encoder is responsible to interact with the memory. Sequence modeling is achieved by predicting the next segment conditioned to the current segment and memory. ### 2.3.1 Dynamic Memorization\n\nWithin the scope of memory networks, there are dynamic memorization techniques. Different from Transformer-XL which stores the token-level history representations as memory, dynamic memorization does not have a theoretical upper bound for the temporal range. Neural Turing Machine (NTM) (Graves et al., 2014) and Differential Neural Computer (DNC) (Graves et al., 2016) are two early models that can control external memory resources to achieve long-lasting memory.\n```\n\n#### 4.

The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded.

Due to their excellent computational ef\ufb01-ciency and scalability, transformer models can be trained on exceedingly large amounts of data at the expense of tremendous growth in model size. As high performance, large-scale, and pre-trained transformer models become increasingly available for users to download and \ufb01ne-tune for customized downstream tasks, their deployment becomes challenging due to the vast amount of operations and large memory footprint. To address this challenge, we introduce methods to deeply compress pre-trained transformer models across three major application domains: NLP, speech, and vision. Speci\ufb01cally, we quantize transformer backbones down to 4-bit and further achieve 50% \ufb01ne-grained structural sparsity on pre-trained BERT, Wav2vec2.0, and Vision Transformer (ViT) models to demonstrate 16x compression while maintaining model accuracy. This is achieved by identifying critical initialization strategies for quantization-and sparsity-aware \ufb01ne-tuning as well as developing novel techniques such as quantizers with a zero-preserving format and scheduled dropout. These hardware-friendly techniques need only to be applied in the \ufb01ne-tuning phase for downstream tasks, which renders them especially suitable for acceleration and deployment of pre-trained transformer models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Dynamic Memory Compression: Retrofitting LLMs for Accelerated Inference\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression transformer feedback*\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Adrian La'ncucki, Marcin Chochowski, David Tarjan, E. Ponti*\n\n**TL;DR:** Dynamic Memory Compression can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as the backbone of large language models (LLMs). However, generation remains inefficient due to the need to store in memory a cache of key-value representations for past tokens, whose size scales linearly with the input sequence length and batch size. As a solution, we propose Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC), a method for online key-value cache compression at inference time. Most importantly, the model learns to apply different compression ratios in different heads and layers. We retrofit pre-trained LLMs such as Llama 2 (7B, 13B and 70B) into DMC Transformers, achieving up to 7x throughput increase during auto-regressive inference on an NVIDIA H100 GPU. DMC is applied via continued pre-training on a negligible percentage of the original data without adding any extra parameters. DMC preserves the original downstream performance with up to 4x cache compression, outperforming up-trained grouped-query attention (GQA) and key-value eviction policies (H$_2$O, TOVA). GQA and DMC can be even combined to obtain compounded gains. Hence, DMC can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. LoRAP: Transformer Sub-Layers Deserve Differentiated Structured Compression for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression transformer feedback*\n\n*Guangyan Li, Yongqiang Tang, Wensheng Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study designs a mixed compression model, which organically combines Low-Rank matrix approximation And structured Pruning (LoRAP), and proposes an input activation weighted singular value decomposition method to strengthen the low-rank characteristic of MHA sub-layer.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) show excellent performance in difficult tasks, but they often require massive memories and computational resources. How to reduce the parameter scale of LLMs has become research hotspots. In this study, we make an important observation that the multi-head self-attention (MHA) sub-layer of Transformer exhibits noticeable low-rank structure, while the feed-forward network (FFN) sub-layer does not. With this regard, we design a mixed compression model, which organically combines Low-Rank matrix approximation And structured Pruning (LoRAP). For the MHA sub-layer, we propose an input activation weighted singular value decomposition method to strengthen the low-rank characteristic. Furthermore, we discover that the weight matrices in MHA sub-layer have different low-rank degrees. Thus, a novel parameter allocation scheme according to the discrepancy of low-rank degrees is devised. For the FFN sub-layer, we propose a gradient-free structured channel pruning method. During the pruning, we get an interesting finding that the least important 1% of parameter actually play a vital role in model performance. Extensive evaluations on zero-shot perplexity and zero-shot task classification indicate that our proposal is superior to previous structured compression rivals under multiple compression ratios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Among the powerful compression approaches, quantization extremely reduces the computation and memory consumption by low-bit parameters and bit-wise operations. However, low-bit ViTs remain largely unexplored and usually suffer from a significant performance drop compared with the real-valued counterparts. In this work, through extensive empirical analysis, we first identify the bottleneck for severe performance drop comes from the information distortion of the low-bit quantized self-attention map. We then develop an information rectification module (IRM) and a distribution guided distillation (DGD) scheme for fully quantized vision transformers (Q-ViT) to effectively eliminate such distortion, leading to a fully quantized ViTs. We evaluate our methods on popular DeiT and Swin backbones. Extensive experimental results show that our method achieves a much better performance than the prior arts. For example, our Q-ViT can theoretically accelerates the ViT-S by 6.14x and achieves about 80.9% Top-1 accuracy, even surpassing the full-precision counterpart by 1.0% on ImageNet dataset.

A Better Alternative to Error Feedback for Communication-Efficient Distributed Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression transformer feedback*\n\n*Peter Richt\u00e1rik, Samuel Horv\u00e1th*\n\n**Abstract:** Modern large-scale machine learning applications require stochastic optimization algorithms to be implemented on distributed compute systems. A key bottleneck of such systems is the communication overhead for exchanging information across the workers, such as stochastic gradients. Among the many techniques proposed to remedy this issue, one of the most successful is the framework of compressed communication with error feedback (EF). EF remains the only known technique that can deal with the error induced by contractive compressors which are not unbiased, such as Top-$K$. In this paper, we propose a new and theoretically and practically better alternative to EF for dealing with contractive compressors. In particular, we propose a construction which can transform any contractive compressor into an induced unbiased compressor. Following this transformation, existing methods able to work with unbiased compressors can be applied. We show that our approach leads to vast improvements over EF, including reduced memory requirements, better communication complexity guarantees and fewer assumptions. We further extend our results to federated learning with partial participation following an arbitrary distribution over the nodes, and demonstrate the benefits thereof. We perform several numerical experiments which validate our theoretical findings.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-19\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on memory compression techniques and feedback mechanisms in transformer architectures, here are some key findings and implementations from the provided sources:\n\n## Memory Compression Techniques\n\n### Adaptive KV-Cache Compression\nThe CASAK-V approach introduces dynamic sparse attention and adaptive KV-cache compression. This method dynamically generates and applies head-specific sparse attention patterns and implements adaptive chunk-wise KV-cache compression. This results in significant memory reductions (up to 40%) and near-linear runtime complexity compared to full attention and caching.\n\n### Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs)\nNAMMs are designed to optimize the latent memory KV cache of transformers. By evolving NAMMs on top of pre-trained language models, this approach reduces the number of retained tokens in the KV cache, leading to efficiency benefits while exceeding the performance of full-context models. NAMMs also enable zero-shot transfer to other transformer models and tasks, including those with different architectures and input modalities.\n\n## Feedback Mechanisms\n\n### Feedback Attention Memory (FAM)\nThe TransformerFAM architecture incorporates a feedback loop that allows the network to attend to its own latent representations. This feedback mechanism enables the network to process indefinitely long sequences, which is crucial for handling long-context tasks without significant performance degradation[Analysis Note #3].\n\n### Dynamic Attention and Context-Aware Mechanisms\nCASAK-V also employs a meta-learning framework to fine-tune a compact pre-trained transformer for sparse pattern identification. The dynamic attention mechanism adjusts based on an attention map reconstruction heuristic, ensuring context-awareness during token generation. This approach can be seen as a form of feedback where the model adapts its attention patterns based on the current context.\n\n## Implementation Details and Performance Characteristics\n\n### Efficiency Metrics\nCASAK-V evaluates its performance using metrics such as peak memory usage, inference time, and total FLOPs for attention computation. The results show that sparse attention computation reduces the total inference time significantly, and KV-cache management contributes to overall efficiency improvements.\n\n### Scalability and Performance\nNAMMs demonstrate improved performance across various long-context tasks, including those from LongBench, InfiniteBench, and ChouBun benchmarks. The approach reduces the context-extended KV cache size while maintaining or improving performance compared to full-context models.\n\n### Hardware Acceleration\nWhile not directly related to software-level memory compression, the use of memristor-based hardware accelerators for transformer self-attention can significantly improve efficiency. This approach reduces power consumption and latency, which can be beneficial when integrating with software-level optimizations for overall system efficiency.\n\n## Hybrid Approaches and Future Directions\n\n### Combining Multiple Efficiency Techniques\nTo achieve the best results, combining multiple efficiency techniques such as IO-aware algorithms (e.g., FlashAttention), structured sparsity patterns, and feedback mechanisms (e.g., TransformerFAM) could be highly effective. Hybrid approaches that integrate adaptive compression techniques with dynamic attention and feedback loops can potentially offer the best balance between performance, efficiency, and scalability[Analysis Note #3].\n\n### Performance Analysis\nFuture research should focus on a detailed performance analysis of different memory augmentation strategies, including the impact of these techniques on various downstream tasks and their scalability with larger models and more data. This will help in identifying the most effective combinations of techniques for different use cases[Analysis Note #3].\n\nBy integrating these memory compression techniques and feedback mechanisms, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and high-performing autoregressive language models.\n",

Recurrent Memory Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.84)\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded. Memory Layers (Lample et al, 2019) model has a product key memory layer instead of a feed-forward layer within Transformer block to increase model capacity.\n```\n\n#### 2. TransformerFAM: Feedback attention is working memory (Avg. Score: 0.62)\n\n*Dongseong Hwang, Weiran Wang, Zhuoyuan Huo, K. Sim, P. M. Mengibar*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Feedback Attention Memory is proposed, a novel Transformer architecture that leverages a feedback loop to enable the network to attend to its own latent representations, allowing it to process indefinitely long sequences.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have revolutionized deep learning, their quadratic attention complexity hinders their ability to process infinitely long inputs. We propose Feedback Attention Memory (FAM), a novel Transformer architecture that leverages a feedback loop to enable the network to attend to its own latent representations. This design fosters the emergence of working memory within the Transformer, allowing it to process indefinitely long sequences. TransformerFAM requires no additional weights, enabling seamless integration with pre-trained models. Our experiments show that TransformerFAM significantly improves Transformer performance on long-context tasks across various model sizes (1B, 8B, and 24B). These results showcase the potential to empower Large Language Models (LLMs) to process sequences of unlimited length.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/36 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n9}$ |\n| BSWA 24B | 78.2 | 62.6 |\n| FAM 24B | $\\mathbf{7 8 . 5}$ | $\\mathbf{6 3 . 4}$ |\n\nTable 2: Summarizes GPT-3 performance on ranking and generative tasks. (Details in Table 12)\n\nThus, BSWA memory segments (local representation) and FAM (global representation) complement each other. For LLMs, we recommend using FAM for compressed contextual representation alongside BSWA memory segments up to inference budgets (e.g., 2k, 8k, 32k [69], or 128k [70]). Due to page limitations in the main paper, ablation studies are presented in Appendix B.4\n\n## 4 Related Work\n\nThere have been attempts to incorporate feedback mechanisms into the Transformer, but most of them involve feeding the output activations from the top layer to the bottom [57, 63] or to intermediate layers [27]. Since the top three layers in the Transformer are heavily focused on output reconstruction [45], we hypothesize that there is a significant representational gap between the top and other layers. In this paper, we propose a feedback mechanism between intermediate layers. There were papers that compressed information blockwise [21, 25, 31, 71, 72]. However, in those papers, the information was not propagated infinitely. Relevant prior work includes the use of recurrent cross-attention between blocks [52], enabling the propagation of compressed information to subsequent blocks. Additionally, incorporating feedback from a few upper layers has been used to integrate past information [61]. We propose TransformerFAM under the assumption that the human brain processes homogenous, heterogeneous, and feedback data with the same attention mechanism across distributed brain areas. Additional related works are presented in Appendix E\n\n## 5 Conclusion\n\nIn the film 'Memento' (2000), the protagonist struggles with anterograde amnesia, which means he can not remember anything before happened in the last 10 minutes, but his long-term memory is intact, He has to tattoo important information on his body to remember it.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/36 (Score: 0.30)*\n\n```\nWe hope that this will save other researchers time when improving the architecture of feedback loops in future studies. ## C. 1 Beyond Block-Recurrent Transformers\n\nBlock-Recurrent Transformers (BRT) [52] have a recurrent state that connects each block, and the recurrent state and the block input sequence exchange information through cross-attention. In this architecture, the recurrent state plays a role similar to FAM. We started the project by removing the additional QKV projection and cross-attention for the recurrent state in BRT and integrating all computations into self-attention. Like BRT, we tried to compress the block input by attention to use it as the recurrent state of the next block, and it required additional projections like BRT. It was difficult to properly train the additional projections that were only used when striding blocks, and as a result, the performance of general tasks such as GPT-3 tasks was degraded. Finally, we found that the activations compressed by attention must go through the FF layer of the Transformer to be aligned as a latent representation that can be used again as the input of the next Transformer. The input of the Transformer and the output of self-attention are very different representations. However, the FF layer transforms it back into a representation similar to the input of the Transformer for the next Transformer layer. After the discovery of reusing the FF layer, we also found that separate QKV projection and additional projections are not required for FAM. That is how the TransformerFAM architecture was created. Around the time this paper was published, Infini-Transformer [79] was also released. InfiniTransformer reported successful PassKey retrieval despite the compressed information not passing through the FF layer. This is because it stores weighted values in scratchpad memory and reuses them, preserving the latent space of the values. However, since the weighted values are all it can represent, there might be limitations in its expressiveness. Furthermore, TransformerFAM maintains the past memory segment from BSWA despite having compressed memory because the compressed memory cannot retain detailed information. Since InfiniTransformer completely discards the past memory segment, it might have difficulty remembering recent details. ## C. 2 Feedback Memory Segment\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2b, TransformerFAM utilizes the updated FAM from the previous block as the input to the current block. Therefore, it is natural to consider using the Transformer outputs of the previous block directly as the input to the current block, instead of using a complex FAM mechanism. Fig. 8 illustrates this modification, which we refer to as the Feedback Memory Segment (FM). FM achieves an infinite theoretical receptive field by performing self-attention at the output level. This is similar to ERNIE-Doc [30], and a specific variant of Staircase Attention [61]. Staircase Attention proposes using activations from progressively higher Transformer layers as the memory segment goes further into the past. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_364db6cf7554a04db2efg-20.jpg?height=193&width=957&top_left_y=2007&top_left_x=584)\n\nFigure 8: Convert TransformerBSWA to TransformerFM\n\nHowever, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 3. Addressing Some Limitations of Transformers with Feedback Memory (Avg. Score: 0.48)\n\n*Angela Fan, Thibaut Lavril, Edouard Grave, Armand Joulin, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv (2020)\t**Cited by** None  (*Influential: None*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Transformers have shortcomings - limited memory and limited state update - but Feedback Memory is a straightforward way to resolve these. \n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have been successfully applied to sequential, auto-regressive tasks despite being feedforward networks. Unlike recurrent neural networks, Transformers use attention to capture temporal relations while processing input tokens in parallel. While this parallelization makes them computationally efficient, it restricts the model from fully exploiting the sequential nature of the input. The representation at a given layer can only access representations from lower layers, rather than the higher level representations already available. In this work, we propose the Feedback Transformer architecture that exposes all previous representations to all future representations, meaning the lowest representation of the current timestep is formed from the highest-level abstract representation of the past. We demonstrate on a variety of benchmarks in language modeling, machine translation, and reinforcement learning that the increased representation capacity can create small, shallow models with much stronger performance than comparable Transformers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/30 (Score: 0.48)*\n\n```\nWhile this parallelization makes them computationally efficient, it restricts the model from fully exploiting the sequential nature of the input.

We demonstrate on a variety of benchmarks in language modeling, machine translation, and reinforcement learning that the increased representation capacity can create small, shallow models with much stronger performance than comparable Transformers. ## 1 INTRODUCTION\n\nIn recent years, the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al, 2017) has brought large improvements to a wide range of Natural Language Processing tasks such as machine translation, sentence representation (Devlin et al., 2019), and summarization (Edunov et al., 2019). Transformers are also successfully used as an autoregressive model on sequential tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al. 2019, Rae et al, 2020) and reinforcement learning (Parisotto et al., 2019). Unlike more traditional recurrent architectures such as RNNs and LSTMs, the Transformer architecture processes a sequence in parallel in an order-invariant way. Techniques such as position embeddings (Sukhbaatar et al. 2015, Shaw et al. 2018) and attention masking are required to capture input order information. In this work, we focus on several limitations of the Transformer architecture as an autoregressive model and present a straightforward solution - Feedback memory. These limitations and our proposed solution target sequential token prediction tasks, such as language modeling or other auto-regressive generative tasks. The feedforward nature of Transformers makes them efficient on modern hardware, but restricts the Transformer from taking full advantage of the input's sequential property. In particular, the current hidden representation of a Transformer only accesses the past representations of lower layers, even though higher level representations of the past have already been computed as an autoregressive model. At generation, the Transformer generates only one token at a time, so it could access these representations for better performance, but does not exploit these at training time due to parallelization. However, if these past higher level representations could be used at training time, they would enrich future lower level representations, enabling shallower models to have the same representation power. Another inherent limitation of Transformers on sequential tasks is the lack of recursive computation (Dehghani et al., 2018), and the number of transformations possible on the input is bounded by the model depth. Such disadvantages have impact on tasks that require careful tracking of a world state or modeling hierarchical structures (Tran et al., 2018; Hahn, 2020). On the other hand, while RNNs can maintain an internal state for an unbounded time while accumulating more computations upon it, the size of this internal state is limited by the dimension of the hidden state. In this work, we propose a novel autoregressive model, the Feedback Transformer, that makes all previous hidden representations accessible to the computation of a representation at any depth -\nthe model feeds back previous computations to itself. The feedback allows the model to perform recursive computation, building stronger representations iteratively upon previous states. To achieve this, we modify self-attention to attend to higher level representations rather than lower ones. As shown in Figure 1, the Feedback Transformer merges the hidden states from all layers into a single vector for every time step and stores them in a memory. Instead of self-attention, all subsequent layers attend to this memory, which means every previously computed representation is accessible by all future layers, mediated by the memory. This allows Feedback Transformers to recursively compute and transform an input as many times as the input length, which is something Transformers cannot achieve. While RNNs can perform recursive computation, the amount of information that Feedback Transformers can maintain is not limited by the number of layers. There are computational benefits to this straightforward modification. First, it uses less memory because all the layers share a single Feedback memory, thus reducing the memory size by $L$ times, where $L$ is the number of layers. There is also less computation because we share the key and value projections during attention computation, which increases the speed of the attention over the Feedback Memory. Further, the GPU memory usage is reduced due to the memory sharing - the overall model is 2 x smaller - allowing the batch size to be increased for computational efficiency. During inference, the increased batch size contributes to substantially faster decoding speeds. In summary, our main contributions are: (1) The Feedback Transformer architecture, which completely changes the way a Transformer works to access available higher level representations immediately. (2) We show the Feedback Transformer can achieve state of the art results with smaller, shallower models that have faster decoding speed and smaller memory footprint. (3) The Feedback Transformer uses substantially less memory during training and inference time. ## 2 RELATED WORK\n\nSeveral previous works have analyzed the limitations of Transformer architectures, such as the inability to process input sequentially (Dehghani et al. 2018) or represent hierarchical structure (Tran et al., 2018). Hahn (2020) demonstrate that Transformers cannot model structures involving bounded recursion, such as closing parentheses. P\u00e9rez et al. (2019) study Transformers in the context of Turing machines, where they must produce unbounded numbers of decoding steps. Various work in probing Transformers identified several limitations where Transformers may not have the computational capacity of recurrent architecture like an LSTM (Hahn, 2020). From the architectural perspective, our work shares similarities with recurrent networks augmented with external shared memories (Graves et al., 2014; Joulin \\& Mikolov, 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015). For example, the stack augmented RNN of Joulin \\& Mikolov(2015) adds an external memory to a recurrent network to keep long term dependencies. Closer to our work, the Neural Turing Machine of Graves et al. (2014) models an unconstrained memory that resembles the self-attention layer of a Transformer. Further improvements to recurrent networks, such as the Gated Feedback RNN (Chung et al., 2015), are based on better controlling signal from different layers and extended to feedback through multiple pathways (Jin et al., 2017). These works are built on recurrent networks with additional components to store long term dependencies. Other works have studied modifications to the Transformer architecture by enriching its structure with components inspired by recurrent networks. For example, Wang et al. (2019) propose adding a local recurrent sublayer to the Transformer layer to remove the need for position embeddings in the multi-head self-attention layers. Universal Transformer (Dehghani et al., 2018) share the parameters between the layers of a Transformer, leading a recurrent network in depth.\n```\n\n#### 4. Memorizing Transformers (Avg.

We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens. On benchmarks including code and mathematics, we find that the model is capable of making use of newly defined functions and theorems during test time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/26 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

In contrast, Multi-Session Conversation (MSC), which consists of multiple sessions over a long term with the same user, is under-investigated. In this paper, we propose History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer (HAHT) for multi-session open-domain dialogue. HAHT maintains a long-term memory of history conversations and utilizes history information to understand current conversation context and generate well-informed and context-relevant responses. Specifically, HAHT first encodes history conversation sessions hierarchically into a history memory. Then, HAHT leverages historical information to facilitate the understanding of the current conversation context by encoding the history memory together with the current context with attention-based mechanisms. Finally, to explicitly utilize historical information, HAHT uses a history-aware response generator that switches between a generic vocabulary and a history-aware vocabulary. Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models. Human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT) is presented, a novel nonhierarchical transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features that achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs.\n\n**Abstract:** We present the Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT): a novel nonhierarchical (i.e. non-pyramidal) transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features. High-resolution features (or tokens) are a natural fit for tasks that involve perceiving fine-grained details such as detection and segmentation, but exchanging global information between these features is expensive in memory and computation because of the way self-attention scales. We provide a highly efficient alternative Group Propagation Block (GP Block) to exchange global information. In each GP Block, features are first grouped together by a fixed number of learnable group tokens; we then perform Group Propagation where global information is exchanged between the grouped features; finally, global information in the updated grouped features is returned back to the image features through a transformer decoder. We evaluate GPViT on a variety of visual recognition tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Our method achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs, for example, our GPViT-L3 outperforms Swin Transformer-B by 2.0 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation with only half as many parameters.

Deep Compression of Pre-trained Transformer Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory transformer compression*\n\n*Naigang Wang, Chia-Chun Liu, Swagath Venkataramani, Sanchari Sen, Chia-Yu Chen, K. E. Maghraoui, Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan, Le Chang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Methods to deeply compress pre-trained transformer models across three major application domains: NLP, speech, and vision are introduced and critical initialization strategies for quantization-and sparsity-aware \ufb01ne-tuning are identified.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained transformer models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP) and have recently become competitive alternatives to Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in vision and speech tasks, respectively. Due to their excellent computational ef\ufb01-ciency and scalability, transformer models can be trained on exceedingly large amounts of data at the expense of tremendous growth in model size. As high performance, large-scale, and pre-trained transformer models become increasingly available for users to download and \ufb01ne-tune for customized downstream tasks, their deployment becomes challenging due to the vast amount of operations and large memory footprint. To address this challenge, we introduce methods to deeply compress pre-trained transformer models across three major application domains: NLP, speech, and vision. Speci\ufb01cally, we quantize transformer backbones down to 4-bit and further achieve 50% \ufb01ne-grained structural sparsity on pre-trained BERT, Wav2vec2.0, and Vision Transformer (ViT) models to demonstrate 16x compression while maintaining model accuracy. This is achieved by identifying critical initialization strategies for quantization-and sparsity-aware \ufb01ne-tuning as well as developing novel techniques such as quantizers with a zero-preserving format and scheduled dropout. These hardware-friendly techniques need only to be applied in the \ufb01ne-tuning phase for downstream tasks, which renders them especially suitable for acceleration and deployment of pre-trained transformer models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. H-Transformer-1D: Fast One-Dimensional Hierarchical Attention for Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory transformer compression*\n\n*Zhenhai Zhu, Radu Soricut*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work describes an efficient hierarchical method to compute attention in the Transformer architecture that exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** We describe an efficient hierarchical method to compute attention in the Transformer architecture. The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark. It also sets a new SOTA test perplexity on One-Billion Word dataset with 5x fewer model parameters than that of the previous-best Transformer-based models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 5. A Hierarchical Spatial Transformer for Massive Point Samples in Continuous Space\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory transformer compression*\n\n*Wenchong He, Zhe Jiang, Tingsong Xiao, Zelin Xu, Shigang Chen, Ronald Fick, Miles Medina, Christine Angelini*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new hierarchical spatial transformer model which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation is proposed, which outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are widely used deep learning architectures. Existing transformers are mostly designed for sequences (texts or time series), images or videos, and graphs. This paper proposes a novel transformer model for massive (up to a million) point samples in continuous space. Such data are ubiquitous in environment sciences (e.g., sensor observations), numerical simulations (e.g., particle-laden flow, astrophysics), and location-based services (e.g., POIs and trajectories). However, designing a transformer for massive spatial points is non-trivial due to several challenges, including implicit long-range and multi-scale dependency on irregular points in continuous space, a non-uniform point distribution, the potential high computational costs of calculating all-pair attention across massive points, and the risks of over-confident predictions due to varying point density. To address these challenges, we propose a new hierarchical spatial transformer model, which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation. We also design an uncertainty quantification branch to estimate prediction confidence related to input feature noise and point sparsity. We provide a theoretical analysis of computational time complexity and memory costs. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and our model can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.

Self-Supervised Variational Auto-Encoders\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory transformer compression*\n\n*Jakub M. Tomczak, Ioannis Gatopoulos*\n\n**Abstract:** Density estimation, compression and data generation are crucial tasks in artificial intelligence. Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) constitute a single framework to achieve these goals. Here, we present a novel class of generative models, called self-supervised Variational Auto-Encoder (selfVAE), that utilizes deterministic and discrete variational posteriors. This class of models allows to perform both conditional and unconditional sampling, while simplifying the objective function. First, we use a single self-supervised transformation as a latent variable, where a transformation is either downscaling or edge detection. Next, we consider a hierarchical architecture, i.e., multiple transformations, and we show its benefits compared to the VAE. The flexibility of selfVAE in data reconstruction finds a particularly interesting use case in data compression tasks, where we can trade-off memory for better data quality, and vice-versa. We present performance of our approach on three benchmark image data (Cifar10, Imagenette64, and CelebA).\n\n**Conference:** self-supervised-variational-auto-encoders\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-05\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hybrid CNN-Transformer Architecture for Efficient Large-Scale Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory transformer compression*\n\n*Xin Yuan, Mingyu Zhu, Lishun Wang, Miao Cao*\n\n**Abstract:** Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) uses a low-speed 2D detector to capture high-speed scene, where the dynamic scene is modulated by different masks and then compressed into a snapshot measurement. Following this, a reconstruction algorithm is needed to reconstruct the high-speed video frames. Although state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning-based reconstruction algorithms have achieved impressive results, they still face the following challenges due to excessive model complexity and GPU memory limitations: (1) These models need high computational cost, and (2) They are usually unable to reconstruct large-scale video frames at high compression ratios. To address these issues, we develop an efficient network for video SCI by using hierarchical residual-like connections and hybrid CNN-Transformer structure within a single residual block, dubbed EfficientSCI++. The EfficientSCI++ network can well explore spatial-temporal correlation using convolution in\r\nthe spatial domain and Transformer in the temporal domain, respectively. We are the first time to demonstrate that a UHD\r\ncolor video (1644\u00d73840 \u00d73) with high compression ratio (40) can be reconstructed from a snapshot 2D measurement using\r\na single end-to-end deep learning model with PSNR above 34 dB. Moreover, a mixed-precision model is trained to further\r\naccelerate the video SCI reconstruction process and save memory footprint. Extensive results on both simulation and real\r\ndata demonstrate that, compared with precious SOTA methods, our proposed EfficientSCI++ and EfficientSCI can achieve\r\ncomparable reconstruction quality with much cheaper computational cost and better real-time performance.

Peeling the Onion: Hierarchical Reduction of Data Redundancy for Efficient Vision Transformer Training\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory transformer compression*\n\n*Yanzhi Wang, Zhangyang Wang, Xiaohui Xie, Xiaolong Ma, Tianlong Chen, Minghai Qin, Hao Tang, Xuan Shen, Xin Meng, Peiyan Dong, Yanyue Xie, Mengshu Sun, Geng Yuan, Haoyu Ma, Zhenglun Kong*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently obtained success in many applications, but their intensive computation and heavy memory usage at both training and inference time limit their generalization. Previous compression algorithms usually start from the pre-trained dense models and only focus on efficient inference, while time-consuming training is still unavoidable. In contrast, this paper points out that the million-scale training data is redundant, which is the fundamental reason for the tedious training. To address the issue, this paper aims to introduce sparsity into data and proposes an end-to-end efficient training framework from three sparse perspectives, dubbed Tri-Level E-ViT. Specifically, we leverage a hierarchical data redundancy reduction scheme, by exploring the sparsity under three levels: number of training examples in the dataset, number of patches (tokens) in each example, and number of connections between tokens that lie in attention weights. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed technique can noticeably accelerate training for various ViT architectures while maintaining accuracy. Remarkably, under certain ratios, we are able to improve the ViT accuracy rather than compromising it. For example, we can achieve 15.2% speedup with 72.6% (+0.4) Top-1 accuracy on Deit-T, and 15.7% speedup with 79.9% (+0.1) Top-1 accuracy on Deit-S. This proves the existence of data redundancy in ViT.\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-19\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model (LM) design by integrating hierarchical memory structures with compression techniques and feedback mechanisms, here are some key points and relevant information from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Hierarchical Memory Structures\n\n### Hierarchical Organization\nHierarchical memory structures can be designed to organize memory in multiple layers, each handling different levels of abstraction or granularity. For example, the \"Feedback Memory Transformer\" concept exposes all previous representations to all future representations, creating a hierarchical feedback loop that can be integrated with memory compression techniques.\n\n### Memory Augmentation and Clustering\nThe \"Memformer\" architecture interacts with external dynamic memory through reading and writing modules and includes a forgetting mechanism to improve memorization. This can be extended by using hierarchical clustering methods, similar to those in the hierarchical Graph Neural Network (h-GNN) model, which successively stacks multiple compressed-size graphs to increase network depth and preserve local and global information.\n\n## Integration with Compression Techniques\n\n### Dynamic Memory Compression\nDynamic memory compression techniques, such as those described in \"Dynamic Memory Compression,\" can achieve significant throughput increases during auto-regressive inference while preserving downstream performance. This can be integrated with hierarchical memory structures to compress memory at different levels based on content importance and relevance.\n\n### Lossless Compression\nLossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA) enables lossless compression of the KV cache, which can be applied hierarchically. For instance, compressing the KV cache after every certain number of generated tokens with adaptive compression ratios can maintain efficiency and performance.\n\n## Feedback Mechanisms\n\n### Feedback Loops\nFeedback loops, as in the \"Feedback Memory Transformer,\" can be integrated with hierarchical memory structures to enable unlimited context processing. This allows the model to expose all previous representations to all future representations, enhancing information flow and context understanding.\n\n### Adaptive Feedback\nAdaptive feedback mechanisms based on content relevance can be used to control the compression and memory access. This ensures that the model focuses on the most relevant information while efficiently managing memory resources.\n\n## Performance Characteristics\n\n### Efficiency and Compression Ratios\nUsing hierarchical memory structures with dynamic compression techniques can lead to significant efficiency gains. For example, V:N:M sparsity in Transformers can achieve higher compression ratios and greater speedups compared to traditional sparsity methods, which can be beneficial when integrated with hierarchical memory management.\n\n### IO-Aware Algorithms and Structured Sparsity\nIO-aware algorithms and structured sparsity patterns are crucial for maintaining performance while compressing memory. These techniques ensure that the model's expressiveness is preserved even with reduced memory usage.\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n### Memory Forgetting Mechanisms\nImplementing forgetting mechanisms, as seen in \"Memformer,\" can improve the effectiveness of memorizing new information and prevent memory saturation. This is particularly important in hierarchical memory structures where older information may need to be forgotten to make room for new data.\n\n### Balance Between Compression and Information Preservation\nIt is essential to balance compression with information preservation. Hierarchical memory structures can help in this regard by compressing less critical information at lower levels while keeping more critical information at higher levels with less compression.\n\nIn summary, integrating hierarchical memory structures with dynamic compression techniques, feedback mechanisms, and adaptive control can significantly improve the efficiency and performance of autoregressive language models. This approach allows for better memory management, enhanced context understanding, and improved scalability while maintaining model expressiveness.\n",

This scalability fuels a trend analogous to Moore's law, which links increased model size to performance gains [39]. The effectiveness of attention in text sequence processing was solidified through the Transformer paper. Models like BERT [16] and GPT-3 [33] further showcased the scalability of Transformer and its tendency for improved performance with increased model size. Following the replacement of LSTM [5] by Transformer in most Natural Language Processing (NLP) domains, the Vision Transformer (ViT) [32] replaced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [4] with Transformers in the vision domain, and Conformer (Convolution-augmented Transformer) [29] replaced LSTM in the speech domain. The Transformer has become the de facto architecture in various domains. Currently, attention serves as the leading architecture for extracting meaningful representations from homogeneous data. The logical progression points toward extending attention capabilities to heterogeneous data. This has enabled advances in multimodal fusion (text and vision), as seen in models like DALL$\\cdot$E 2 [55], Flamingo [54] and CoCa [53]. AudioLM [64] has shown that attention also excels at fusing audio and text. Consequently, Gemini [69] integrates text, images, audio, and video into a single generative model. This was possible because attention to heterogeneous data works exceptionally well. Despite the impressive success of attention, it suffers from major drawbacks. Firstly, attention has quadratic complexity with respect to context length, which limits the capability of modeling long contexts. Secondly, it forgets information from context before attention window, unlike LSTM, which theoretically can propagate information indefinitely. We want the better architecture to be able to process arbitrarily long sequences efficiently, while preserving very long-term dependencies. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_364db6cf7554a04db2efg-02.jpg?height=407&width=1404&top_left_y=232&top_left_x=361)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of query-key attention masks for Sliding Window Attention (SWA) variants.

Temporal Latent Bottleneck: Synthesis of Fast and Slow Processing Mechanisms in Sequence Learning (Avg. Score: 0.79)\n\n*Aniket Didolkar, Kshitij Gupta, Anirudh Goyal, Alex Lamb, Nan Rosemary Ke, Y. Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 42/46 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\n[N/A]\n(b) Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?

This work takes inspiration from a wide array of work on introducing multiple scales of processing into recurrent neural networks (Chung et al. 2016; Hihi \\& Bengio, 1995; Mozer, 1991, Schmidhuber, 1991, Koutn\u00edk et al., 2014). These works divide the processing into multiple streams each operating at a different temporal granularity. While these works mainly focus on recurrent neural networks and their application is mainly on natural language tasks, we focus on introducing multiple streams of processing and a hierarchical structure into Transformers while also focusing on a broader range of domains beyond natural language. Transformers. Some of the components we describe in the proposed model have been used previously in various Transformer models. Transformer XL (Dai et al., 2019) also divides the input into segments. Each segment considers the tokens from the current segment and the previous segment for attention without passing gradients into the previous segments. A number of previous works (Zhang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021b, Wu et al., 2021, Yuan et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021) have worked on introducing a hierarchical structure in Transformers mainly in the domain of vision. The main goal of these works has been to introduce convolution-like hierarchies into Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020). While these works progressively reduce the spatial resolution of the inputs in order to introduce hierarchies, we introduce hierarchies by adding another slow stream of information processing and without reducing the spatial resolution of the inputs. We also provision for the higher level of the hierarchy (i.e. the slow stream) to provide information to the lower levels as top-down conditioning which is not possible in any of the previous works. Top-Down Conditioning. Top-down information is information propagated from higher to lower levels of the network. It represents the models beliefs of the world and provides context for interpreting perceptual information.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/46 (Score: 0.73)*\n\n```\n(1986); Baddeley et al. (1984). Deep Learning has seen a variety of architectures for processing sequential data (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal, 1997, Cho et al., 2014). For example. recurrent neural networks compress information about a sequence into a single hidden state. Transformers get rid of the recurrent state by dynamically capturing information between positions using multi-head dot product attention Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have become the dominant architecture across a wide range of domains including vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), natural language (Devlin et al.,\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_f7abbc5aac039e86781bg-02.jpg?height=470&width=813&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=664)\n\nFigure 1: Perceptual module + Temporal Latent Bottleneck Model. $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the perceptual module or the fast stream which is a Transformer. $\\mathcal{I}$ represents the temporal latent bottleneck state (consisting of a set of vectors) that are updated using a recurrent function denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$. The given sequence is first divided into chunks of size $K$ and each chunk $X_{l}$ is processed by $\\mathcal{F}$ which consists of interleaved SELF AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in blue) and Cross AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in green) layers. The Cross Attention + FFN layers allow the representation of $\\mathcal{F}$ to be conditioned on top-down information from $\\mathcal{I}$. The representations of the temporal latent bottleneck state is updated using the outputs of $\\mathcal{F}$ by a recurrent function $\\mathcal{G}$, which consists of a Cross ATTENTION + FFN layer as shown in the circle. 2018; Radford \\& Narasimhan, 2018, Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022; Rae et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). They have eclipsed recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal 1997; Cho et al. 2014) in almost all sequence processing domains due to their high representational capacity and scalability. Despite their wide applicability, it is well known that Transformers are very data hungry and work well mainly at scale. This can be attributed to their inductive bias towards modeling all possible pairwise interactions in the sequence which results in no consolidation of information. This lack of selectivity in the attention mechanism also leads to a high computational complexity which scales quadratically with input size. Additionally, modeling all possible pairwise interactions maybe extremely wasteful and may result in capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task (Goyal et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). The goal of this work is to design an architecture for autoregressive modeling that has an inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representation that retains the benefits of Transformers while preserving long-range interactions. For learning temporally compressed representations, we start by dividing the computation of the Transformer into two streams of processing - a fast stream and a slow stream. Inspired by the idea of long-term and short-term memory, we want the fast stream to have a short-term memory with a high capacity that reacts quickly to sensory input. We refer to this fast stream as the perceptual module and implement it using a Transformer since they are known to have high representational capacity. On the other hand, we want the slow stream to have a long-term memory which updates at a slower rate and summarizes the most important information in the input sequence. We refer to this slow stream as the Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Implementation-wise, we divide the input into fixed size chunks (Figure 1). The fast stream operates within each chunk while the slow stream consolidates and aggregates information across chunks updating itself once per chunk. This leads to information asymmetry between fast and slow stream as the fast stream contains fine-grained local information while the slow stream contains coarse-grained distant information. Such kind of information asymmetry has shown to improve generalization and adaptation performance of learned policies in the context of RL (Goyal et al., 2019a, Galashov et al., 2019). The fast and slow streams interact with each other though bottleneck of attention. The division of computation into a fast and slow stream eliminates the need for capturing all possible pairwise interactions and thus introducing selectivity in the attention mechanism resulting in a much lower computational complexity which is not quadratic in the input size. We show that the limited capacity of the slow stream and consolidation of information by a recurrent neural network prevents the model from capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of domains showing that it consistently outperforms competent baselines showing improved generalization to scenarios not seen during training. ## 2 Methodology\n\nWe now present the proposed approach in detail. Our model jointly leverages the strengths of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Cho et al., 2014, Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997). ```\nAlgorithm 1: PyTorch-style pseudocode for proposed model\n    C (query, key, value): CRoss Attention + FFN LAYER\n    \uff5e \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (query, key, value): SElf AtTEntion + FFN LAYER\n\\# L: Num.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/29 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2007.14062, 2020. ## Checklist\n\n1.

In this work, we show that existing models fail to take full advantage of its potential. Motivated by this finding, we develop GateLoop, a foundational sequence model that generalizes linear recurrent models such as S4, S5, LRU and RetNet, by employing data-controlled state transitions. Utilizing this theoretical advance, GateLoop empirically outperforms existing models for auto-regressive language modeling. Our method comes with a low-cost $O(l)$ recurrent mode and an efficient $O(l \\log_{2} l)$ parallel mode making use of highly optimized associative scan implementations. Furthermore, we derive an $O(l^2)$ surrogate attention mode, revealing remarkable implications for Transformer and recently proposed architectures. Specifically, we prove that our approach can be interpreted as providing data-controlled relative-positional information to Attention. While many existing models solely rely on data-controlled cumulative sums for context aggregation, our findings suggest that incorporating data-controlled complex cumulative products may be a crucial step towards more powerful sequence models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/15 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_539af27a11cae64ab314g-09.jpg?height=413&width=856&top_left_y=1105&top_left_x=626)\n\nFigure 8: We plot the state transitions of the trained model for a random test input batch at layers 0 and 8 . We observe structured patterns in the data-controlled state transition. While we leave interpretability for future work, we point out that these patterns indicate that the trained model deliberately utilizes the data-controlled gating of the state transition (and thus forgetting and retention of memories) by applying large varieties of magnitudes and phases. ## 6 Future Work\n\nWhile our primary focus in this paper is to establish the groundwork for constructing fully datacontrolled linear RNNs, we recognize the multitude of opportunities for future research. One avenue involves exploring the effects of different initialization strategies, amplitude- and phase-activations. Moreover, we suggest that future work should pay focus to the interpretability of the learned state transitions for gaining deeper insights into the model's inner workings. ## 7 CONCLUSION\n\nWe introduce GateLoop, a fully data-controlled linear RNN which generalizes existing linear recurrent models by leveraging data controlled gating of inputs and outputs and state transitions. While our method comes with linear runtime complexity $O(l)$, we derive an efficient parallelizable $O(l \\log l)$ training strategy utilizing parallel scans. Furthermore, GateLoop can be reformulated in an equivalent $O\\left(l^{2}\\right)$ surrogate attention mode which reveals, that its mechanism can be interpreted as providing relative positional information to Attention. Finally we validate empirically, that fully data-controlled linear recurrence is highly performant for autoregressive language modeling. ## REFERENCES\n\nGuy Blelloch.

Here are the key aspects and the most relevant information to help achieve this goal:\n\n## Key Components of the Proposal\n\n### Hierarchical Memory\n- The proposal involves integrating a hierarchical memory structure within a GatedMLP framework. This is inspired by works like the Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM) which efficiently manages long-term dependencies by dividing the past into chunks and performing attention over these chunks.\n\n### Dynamic Compression with Feedback\n- Dynamic compression techniques with feedback are crucial. References like \"Dynamic Model Pruning with Feedback\" show how dynamic allocation of sparsity patterns and feedback signals can be used to compress models without additional overhead.\n\n### Feedback Integration\n- Feedback mechanisms are essential for enhancing long-term information processing. Works such as \"TransformerFAM: Feedback Attention is Working Memory\" and \"Deep Networks with Internal Selective Attention through Feedback Connections\" provide insights into how feedback loops can be integrated into feedforward networks to improve performance.\n\n## Relevant Insights and Techniques\n\n### Activation Sparsity and Efficiency\n- The concept of activation sparsity, as discussed in \"Training-Free Activation Sparsity in Large Language Models,\" can be beneficial for reducing computational and memory requirements during inference. This technique could be integrated into the dynamic compression unit to enhance efficiency.\n\n### Hierarchical and Feedback Mechanisms\n- Hierarchical recurrent neural networks (HRNNs) and their ability to decompose hierarchical behavior into useful subprograms can provide valuable insights into how to structure the hierarchical memory module. HRNNs are effective in forecasting and handling long-term dependencies, which aligns with the goals of the proposed model.\n\n### Efficient Processing of Long Sequences\n- The use of feedback attention and hierarchical memory can significantly improve the model's ability to process long sequences. This is supported by works like \"TransformerFAM\" which enables networks to attend to their own latent representations, allowing for the processing of indefinitely long sequences.\n\n### Implementation and Training Stability\n- Managing complexity and ensuring training stability are critical. Techniques such as gradient clipping, proper initialization, and advanced optimization methods can help address potential training challenges. The modular design and careful architectural planning suggested in the analysis note are also important considerations.\n\n## Alignment with Current Research Trends\n\n- The proposal aligns well with current trends in developing efficient neural architectures capable of handling long-context scenarios and optimizing memory usage. This is consistent with innovative research directions that focus on integrating multiple advanced techniques to enhance model performance and efficiency.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n### Finalize Novelty Confirmation\n- Ensure that no existing work directly implements the proposed combination of hierarchical memory, dynamic compression, and feedback mechanisms within a GatedMLP framework.

Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.92)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/49 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nGovernment.

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/19 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/1506.02075, 2015.

However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for SSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/63 (Score: 0.69)*\n\n```\n2023. [11] N. Chomsky.

Score: 0.62)\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/29 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\nIn 2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5884-5888, 2018. doi: 10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8462506.

RNNs Can Generate Bounded Hierarchical Languages with Optimal Memory\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory neural networks*\n\n*John Hewitt, Michael Hahn, S. Ganguli, Percy Liang, Christopher D. Manning*\n\n**TL;DR:** Dyck- is introduced, the language of well-nested brackets and nesting depth, reflecting the bounded memory needs and long-distance dependencies of natural language syntax, and it is proved that an RNN with $O(m \\log k)$ hidden units suffices, an exponential reduction in memory, by an explicit construction.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks empirically generate natural language with high syntactic fidelity. However, their success is not well-understood theoretically. We provide theoretical insight into this success, proving in a finite-precision setting that RNNs can efficiently generate bounded hierarchical languages that reflect the scaffolding of natural language syntax. We introduce Dyck-($k$,$m$), the language of well-nested brackets (of $k$ types) and $m$-bounded nesting depth, reflecting the bounded memory needs and long-distance dependencies of natural language syntax. The best known results use $O(k^{\\frac{m}{2}})$ memory (hidden units) to generate these languages. We prove that an RNN with $O(m \\log k)$ hidden units suffices, an exponential reduction in memory, by an explicit construction. Finally, we show that no algorithm, even with unbounded computation, can suffice with $o(m \\log k)$ hidden units.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 2.

In this paper, we explore an important step toward this generation task: training an LSTM (Longshort term memory) auto-encoder to preserve and reconstruct multi-sentence paragraphs. We introduce an LSTM model that hierarchically builds an embedding for a paragraph from embeddings for sentences and words, then decodes this embedding to reconstruct the original paragraph. We evaluate the reconstructed paragraph using standard metrics like ROUGE and Entity Grid, showing that neural models are able to encode texts in a way that preserve syntactic, semantic, and discourse coherence. While only a first step toward generating coherent text units from neural models, our work has the potential to significantly impact natural language generation and summarization1.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 597  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n#### 3.

Frequency-Domain Dynamic Pruning for Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic compression neural networks*\n\n*Z. Liu, Jizheng Xu, Xiulian Peng, Ruiqin Xiong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can outperform previous spatial-domain counterparts by a large margin and can achieve a compression ratio of 8.4x and a theoretical inference speed-up of 9.2x for ResNet-110, while the accuracy is even better than the reference model on CIFAR-110.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep convolutional neural networks have demonstrated their powerfulness in a variety of applications. However, the storage and computational requirements have largely restricted their further extensions on mobile devices. Recently, pruning of unimportant parameters has been used for both network compression and acceleration. Considering that there are spatial redundancy within most filters in a CNN, we propose a frequency-domain dynamic pruning scheme to exploit the spatial correlations. The frequency-domain coefficients are pruned dynamically in each iteration and different frequency bands are pruned discriminatively, given their different importance on accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can outperform previous spatial-domain counterparts by a large margin. Specifically, it can achieve a compression ratio of 8.4x and a theoretical inference speed-up of 9.2x for ResNet-110, while the accuracy is even better than the reference model on CIFAR-110.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 130  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 5. DynaBERT: Dynamic BERT with Adaptive Width and Depth\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic compression neural networks*\n\n*Lu Hou, Zhiqi Huang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel dynamic BERT model, which can run at adaptive width and depth, is proposed (abbreviated as DynaBERT), which has comparable performance as BERT (or RoBERTa), while at smaller widths and depths consistently outperforms existing BERT compression methods.\n\n**Abstract:** The pre-trained language models like BERT and RoBERTa, though powerful in many natural language processing tasks, are both computational and memory expensive. To alleviate this problem, one approach is to compress them for specific tasks before deployment. However, recent works on BERT compression usually reduce the large BERT model to a fixed smaller size, and can not fully satisfy the requirements of different edge devices with various hardware performances. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic BERT model (abbreviated as DynaBERT), which can run at adaptive width and depth. The training process of DynaBERT includes first training a width-adaptive BERT and then allows both adaptive width and depth, by distilling knowledge from the full-sized model to small sub-networks. Network rewiring is also used to keep the more important attention heads and neurons shared by more sub-networks. Comprehensive experiments under various efficiency constraints demonstrate that our proposed dynamic BERT (or RoBERTa) at its largest size has comparable performance as BERT (or RoBERTa), while at smaller widths and depths consistently outperforms existing BERT compression methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 296  (*Influential: 43*)\n\n#### 6. Task-aware Distributed Source Coding under Dynamic Bandwidth\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic compression neural networks*\n\n*Po-han Li, S. Ankireddy, Ruihan Zhao, Hossein Nourkhiz Mahjoub, Ehsan Moradi-Pari, U. Topcu, Sandeep P. Chinchali, Hyeji Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** NDPCA flexibly compresses data from multiple sources to any available bandwidth with a single model, reducing computing and storage overhead and improving the success rate of multi-view robotic arm manipulation and the accuracy of object detection tasks on satellite imagery.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient compression of correlated data is essential to minimize communication overload in multi-sensor networks. In such networks, each sensor independently compresses the data and transmits them to a central node due to limited communication bandwidth. A decoder at the central node decompresses and passes the data to a pre-trained machine learning-based task to generate the final output. Thus, it is important to compress the features that are relevant to the task. Additionally, the final performance depends heavily on the total available bandwidth. In practice, it is common to encounter varying availability in bandwidth, and higher bandwidth results in better performance of the task. We design a novel distributed compression framework composed of independent encoders and a joint decoder, which we call neural distributed principal component analysis (NDPCA). NDPCA flexibly compresses data from multiple sources to any available bandwidth with a single model, reducing computing and storage overhead. NDPCA achieves this by learning low-rank task representations and efficiently distributing bandwidth among sensors, thus providing a graceful trade-off between performance and bandwidth. Experiments show that NDPCA improves the success rate of multi-view robotic arm manipulation by 9% and the accuracy of object detection tasks on satellite imagery by 14% compared to an autoencoder with uniform bandwidth allocation.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. NU-MCC: Multiview Compressive Coding with Neighborhood Decoder and Repulsive UDF\n\n*From Search Query: compressive transformers*\n\n*S. Lionar, Xiangyu Xu, Min-Hui Lin, G. Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** NU-MCC is a novel alternative to the occupancy field used in MCC that outperforms MCC by 9.7% in terms of the F1-score on the CO3D-v2 dataset with more than 5x faster running speed and can achieve more complete surface reconstruction.\n\n**Abstract:** Remarkable progress has been made in 3D reconstruction from single-view RGB-D inputs. MCC is the current state-of-the-art method in this field, which achieves unprecedented success by combining vision Transformers with large-scale training. However, we identified two key limitations of MCC: 1) The Transformer decoder is inefficient in handling large number of query points; 2) The 3D representation struggles to recover high-fidelity details. In this paper, we propose a new approach called NU-MCC that addresses these limitations. NU-MCC includes two key innovations: a Neighborhood decoder and a Repulsive Unsigned Distance Function (Repulsive UDF). First, our Neighborhood decoder introduces center points as an efficient proxy of input visual features, allowing each query point to only attend to a small neighborhood. This design not only results in much faster inference speed but also enables the exploitation of finer-scale visual features for improved recovery of 3D textures. Second, our Repulsive UDF is a novel alternative to the occupancy field used in MCC, significantly improving the quality of 3D object reconstruction. Compared to standard UDFs that suffer from holes in results, our proposed Repulsive UDF can achieve more complete surface reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that NU-MCC is able to learn a strong 3D representation, significantly advancing the state of the art in single-view 3D reconstruction. Particularly, it outperforms MCC by 9.7% in terms of the F1-score on the CO3D-v2 dataset with more than 5x faster running speed.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 8. BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding\n\n*From Search Query: compressive transformers*\n\n*Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, Kristina Toutanova*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new language representation model, BERT, designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers, which can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 83344  (*Influential: 19244*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Numerical Optimizations for Weighted Low-rank Estimation on Language\n  Model\n\n*From Search Query: compressive transformers*\n\n*Ting Hua, Yen-Chang Hsu, Felicity Wang, Qian Lou, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin*\n\n**Abstract:** Singular value decomposition (SVD) is one of the most popular compression\nmethods that approximate a target matrix with smaller matrices. However,\nstandard SVD treats the parameters within the matrix with equal importance,\nwhich is a simple but unrealistic assumption. The parameters of a trained\nneural network model may affect task performance unevenly, which suggests\nnon-equal importance among the parameters. Compared to SVD, the decomposition\nmethod aware of parameter importance is the more practical choice in real\ncases. Unlike standard SVD, weighted value decomposition is a non-convex\noptimization problem that lacks a closed-form solution. We systematically\ninvestigated multiple optimization strategies to tackle the problem and\nexamined our method by compressing Transformer-based language models. Further,\nwe designed a metric to predict when the SVD may introduce a significant\nperformance drop, for which our method can be a rescue strategy. The extensive\nevaluations demonstrate that our method can perform better than current SOTA\nmethods in compressing Transformer-based language models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-02T00:58:02Z  (*Updated: 2022-12-15T22:45:46Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Hierarchical Neural Memory Network for Low Latency Event Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory neural networks*\n\n*Ken Sakurada, Masaki Onishi, Yasutaka Furukawa, Ryuhei Hamaguchi*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a low latency neural network architecture for event-based dense prediction tasks. Conventional architectures encode entire scene contents at a fixed rate regardless of their temporal characteristics. Instead, the proposed network encodes contents at a proper temporal scale depending on its movement speed. We achieve this by constructing temporal hierarchy using stacked latent memories that operate at different rates. Given low latency event steams, the multi-level memories gradually extract dynamic to static scene contents by propagating information from the fast to the slow memory modules. The architecture not only reduces the redundancy of conventional architectures but also exploits long-term dependencies. Furthermore, an attention-based event representation efficiently encodes sparse event streams into the memory cells. We conduct extensive evaluations on three event-based dense prediction tasks, where the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods on accuracy and latency, while demonstrating effective event and image fusion capabilities.

Distributed Hierarchical GPU Parameter Server for Massive Scale Deep Learning Ads Systems\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory neural networks*\n\n*Weijie Zhao, Deping Xie, Yulei Qian, Ruiquan Ding, Mingming Sun, Ronglai Jia, Ping Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks of ads systems usually take input from multiple resources, e.g., query-ad relevance, ad features and user portraits. These inputs are encoded into one-hot or multi-hot binary features, with typically only a tiny fraction of nonzero feature values per example. Deep learning models in online advertising industries can have terabyte-scale parameters that do not fit in the GPU memory nor the CPU main memory on a computing node. For example, a sponsored online advertising system can contain more than $10^{11}$ sparse features, making the neural network a massive model with around 10 TB parameters. In this paper, we introduce a distributed GPU hierarchical parameter server for massive scale deep learning ads systems. We propose a hierarchical workflow that utilizes GPU High-Bandwidth Memory, CPU main memory and SSD as 3-layer hierarchical storage. All the neural network training computations are contained in GPUs. Extensive experiments on real-world data confirm the effectiveness and the scalability of the proposed system. A 4-node hierarchical GPU parameter server can train a model more than 2X faster than a 150-node in-memory distributed parameter server in an MPI cluster. In addition, the price-performance ratio of our proposed system is 4-9 times better than an MPI-cluster solution.\n\n**Published:** 2020-03-12\n\n\n\n#### 3. Efficient neural networks for real-time modeling of analog dynamic range compression\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic compression neural networks*\n\n*Joshua D. Reiss, Christian J. Steinmetz*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning approaches have demonstrated success in modeling analog audio effects. Nevertheless, challenges remain in modeling more complex effects that involve time-varying nonlinear elements, such as dynamic range compressors. Existing neural network approaches for modeling compression either ignore the device parameters, do not attain sufficient accuracy, or otherwise require large noncausal models prohibiting real-time operation. In this work, we propose a modification to temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) enabling greater efficiency without sacrificing performance. By utilizing very sparse convolutional kernels through rapidly growing dilations, our model attains a significant receptive field using fewer layers, reducing computation. Through a detailed evaluation we demonstrate our efficient and causal approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in modeling the analog LA-2A, is capable of real-time operation on CPU, and only requires 10 minutes of training data.\n\n**Published:** 2021-02-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. SCOP: Scientific Control for Reliable Neural Network Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic compression neural networks*\n\n*Chang Xu, Chao Xu, Chunjing Xu, DaCheng Tao, Yixing Xu, Yunhe Wang, Yehui Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a reliable neural network pruning algorithm by setting up a scientific control. Existing pruning methods have developed various hypotheses to approximate the importance of filters to the network and then execute filter pruning accordingly. To increase the reliability of the results, we prefer to have a more rigorous research design by including a scientific control group as an essential part to minimize the effect of all factors except the association between the filter and expected network output. Acting as a control group, knockoff feature is generated to mimic the feature map produced by the network filter, but they are conditionally independent of the example label given the real feature map. We theoretically suggest that the knockoff condition can be approximately preserved given the information propagation of network layers. Besides the real feature map on an intermediate layer, the corresponding knockoff feature is brought in as another auxiliary input signal for the subsequent layers. Redundant filters can be discovered in the adversarial process of different features. Through experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over state-of-the-art methods. For example, our method can reduce 57.8% parameters and 60.2% FLOPs of ResNet-101 with only 0.01% top-1 accuracy loss on ImageNet.

VCT: A Video Compression Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: compressive transformers*\n\n*Eirikur Agustsson, Mario Lucic, Sergi Caelles, Sung-Jin Hwang, David Minnen, George Toderici, Fabian Mentzer*\n\n**Abstract:** We show how transformers can be used to vastly simplify neural video compression. Previous methods have been relying on an increasing number of architectural biases and priors, including motion prediction and warping operations, resulting in complex models. Instead, we independently map input frames to representations and use a transformer to model their dependencies, letting it predict the distribution of future representations given the past. The resulting video compression transformer outperforms previous methods on standard video compression data sets. Experiments on synthetic data show that our model learns to handle complex motion patterns such as panning, blurring and fading purely from data. Our approach is easy to implement, and we release code to facilitate future research.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher evaluate and refine the proposal for the **HierarchicalCompressiveGatedMLP**, here are some key points and relevant information that address the areas of novelty, impact on performance, efficiency, implementation feasibility, and alignment with current research trends.\n\n### Novelty Assessment\n\n- **Compressive Transformers**: These models have been designed to handle long-range dependencies efficiently. For example, the Compressive Transformer uses a combination of local and global attention mechanisms along with a compression mechanism to reduce the memory requirements for long sequences. This is similar to the hierarchical memory and dynamic compression proposed in HierarchicalCompressiveGatedMLP, but the specific implementation details and the use of feedback mechanisms could be unique.\n\n- **Memory-Augmented Neural Networks**: These networks use external memory modules to store and retrieve information, which can be seen as a form of hierarchical memory organization. However, the adaptive compression and feedback mechanisms in HierarchicalCompressiveGatedMLP may differentiate it from existing memory-augmented models.\n\n- **Hierarchical Multiscale RNNs**: These models use multiple levels of RNNs to process sequences at different scales, similar to the hierarchical memory structure proposed. However, the dynamic compression and feedback integration in HierarchicalCompressiveGatedMLP could offer additional benefits not seen in traditional hierarchical RNNs.\n\n### Impact on Accuracy and Performance\n\n- **Performance on Long Sequences**: Models like the Compressive Transformer have shown improvements in handling long sequences by reducing memory requirements and computational overhead. The hierarchical memory and dynamic compression in HierarchicalCompressiveGatedMLP could similarly enhance performance on long sequences by efficiently managing memory and focusing on critical information.\n\n- **Downstream Tasks**: The integration of feedback mechanisms and adaptive compression could improve the model's ability to capture complex dependencies and retain important information, potentially leading to better performance on downstream tasks compared to standard GatedMLP.\n\n### Efficiency and Scalability\n\n- **Computational Efficiency**: The use of dynamic compression and hierarchical memory structures can significantly reduce computational overhead, especially when processing long sequences. This is similar to the approach in Compressive Transformers, which also aim to minimize computational costs while maintaining performance.\n\n- **Scalability**: By efficiently managing memory through adaptive compression, HierarchicalCompressiveGatedMLP could scale better to larger models and larger datasets, which is a critical aspect for modern language models.\n\n### Implementation Feasibility\n\n- **Technical Challenges**: Implementing hierarchical memory structures and dynamic compression within the GatedMLP framework may require careful design to ensure that the model can effectively learn and utilize these mechanisms. This could involve adjusting the training process, loss functions, and optimization techniques to accommodate the new components.\n\n- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Integrating feedback loops between different memory levels can be complex but has been successfully implemented in other neural network architectures. For example, the neural history compressor uses a hierarchical RNN structure with feedback to compress and process sequences efficiently.\n\n### Alignment with Current Research Trends\n\n- **Transformer Variants**: The proposal aligns with current trends in transformer variants that focus on efficiency and scalability. Models like the Compressive Transformer and other efficient attention mechanisms (e.g., Linformer) are designed to handle long sequences and reduce computational overhead, which is consistent with the goals of HierarchicalCompressiveGatedMLP.\n\n- **Memory-Efficient Models**: The use of hierarchical memory and dynamic compression is in line with the broader trend of developing memory-efficient models. This includes techniques like multi-modal feature fusion, which also aim to optimize the use of available memory and computational resources.\n\n### Relevant References and Excerpts\n\n- **Hierarchical RNNs and Memory Compression**:\n  - The neural history compressor is an example of a hierarchical RNN structure that uses feedback to compress and process sequences efficiently.

In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs, enabling them to effectively handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an on-line fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient and human-like access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench dataset demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art InfLLM model with an overall relative improvement of 4.3% across various tasks, including a 33% improvement on the PassageRetrieval task. Furthermore, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting a bridge between this artificial system and its biological counterpart. This work not only advances LLM capabilities in processing extended contexts but also provides a computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms, opening new avenues for interdisciplinary research in AI and cognitive science.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/36 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2311.09431, 2023.

We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens. Our code, pretrained models, and hyperparameters are available in both Tensorflow and PyTorch.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/46 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nMultiMedia LLC. 2009.

At their core is an attention function which models pairwise interactions between the inputs at every timestep. While attention is powerful, it does not scale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic time and space complexity in the sequence length. We propose RFA, a linear time and space attention that uses random feature methods to approximate the softmax function, and explore its application in transformers. RFA can be used as a drop-in replacement for conventional softmax attention and offers a straightforward way of learning with recency bias through an optional gating mechanism. Experiments on language modeling and machine translation demonstrate that RFA achieves similar or better performance compared to strong transformer baselines. In the machine translation experiment, RFA decodes twice as fast as a vanilla transformer. Compared to existing efficient transformer variants, RFA is competitive in terms of both accuracy and efficiency on three long text classification datasets. Our analysis shows that RFA's efficiency gains are especially notable on long sequences, suggesting that RFA will be particularly useful in tasks that require working with large inputs, fast decoding speed, or low memory footprints.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/40 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\narXiv: 1910.01108, 2020.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 15 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: adaptive compression neural networks, feedback mechanisms in feedforward networks, hierarchical memory compression models\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Adaptive Estimators Show Information Compression in Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression neural networks*\n\n*Ivan Chelombiev, Conor J. Houghton, Cian O\u2019Donnell*\n\n**TL;DR:** More robust mutual information estimation techniques are developed, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions, which explore compression in networks with a range of different activation functions.\n\n**Abstract:** To improve how neural networks function it is crucial to understand their learning process. The information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes that neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their representations to disregard information that is not relevant to the task. However, empirical evidence for this theory is conflicting, as compression was only observed when networks used saturating activation functions. In contrast, networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of task performance but did not show compression. In this paper we developed more robust mutual information estimation techniques, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions. Using these adaptive estimation techniques, we explored compression in networks with a range of different activation functions. With two improved methods of estimation, firstly, we show that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression, and the amount of compression varies between different activation functions. We also find that there is a large amount of variation in compression between different network initializations. Secondary, we see that L2 regularization leads to significantly increased compression, while preventing overfitting. Finally, we show that only compression of the last layer is positively correlated with generalization.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 2.

The mainstream approaches for runtime acceleration consist in pruning connections (unstructured pruning) or, better, filters (structured pruning), both often requiring data to re-train the model. In this paper, we present RED, a data-free structured, unified approach to tackle structured pruning. First, we propose a novel adaptive hashing of the scalar DNN weight distribution densities to increase the number of identical neurons represented by their weight vectors. Second, we prune the network by merging redundant neurons based on their relative similarities, as defined by their distance. Third, we propose a novel uneven depthwise separation technique to further prune convolutional layers. We demonstrate through a large variety of benchmarks that RED largely outperforms other data-free pruning methods, often reaching performance similar to unconstrained, data-driven methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

(iii) We propose an experiment framework with generative models of synthetic datasets, on which we train deep neural networks with a weight constraint designed so that the assumption in (i) is verified during learning. We study the behavior of entropies and mutual informations throughout learning and conclude that, in the proposed setting, the relationship between compression and generalization remains elusive.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 167  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4. Not-So-CLEVR: Visual Relations Strain Feedforward Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: feedback mechanisms in feedforward networks*\n\n*Matthew Ricci, Junkyung Kim, Thomas Serre*\n\n**TL;DR:** Motivated by the comparable success of biological vision, it is argued that feedback mechanisms including working memory and attention are the key computational components underlying abstract visual reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** The robust and efficient recognition of visual relations in images is a hallmark of biological vision. Here, we argue that, despite recent progress in visual recognition, modern machine vision algorithms are severely limited in their ability to learn visual relations. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that visual-relation problems strain convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The networks eventually break altogether when rote memorization becomes impossible such as when the intra-class variability exceeds their capacity. We further show that another type of feedforward network, called a relational network (RN), which was shown to successfully solve seemingly difficult visual question answering (VQA) problems on the CLEVR datasets, suffers similar limitations. Motivated by the comparable success of biological vision, we argue that feedback mechanisms including working memory and attention are the key computational components underlying abstract visual reasoning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 5. Neural Networks with Recurrent Generative Feedback\n\n*From Search Query: feedback mechanisms in feedforward networks*\n\n*Yujia Huang, James Gornet, Sihui Dai, Zhiding Yu, T. Nguyen, Doris Y. Tsao, Anima Anandkumar*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed framework, termed Convolutional Neural Networks with Feedback (CNN-F), introduces a generative feedback with latent variables into existing CNN architectures, making consistent predictions via alternating MAP inference under a Bayesian framework.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks are vulnerable to input perturbations such as additive noise and adversarial attacks. In contrast, human perception is much more robust to such perturbations. The Bayesian brain hypothesis states that human brains use an internal generative model to update the posterior beliefs of the sensory input. This mechanism can be interpreted as a form of self-consistency between the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the internal generative model and the external environmental. Inspired by this, we enforce consistency in neural networks by incorporating generative recurrent feedback. We instantiate it on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed framework, termed Convolutional Neural Networks with Feedback (CNN-F), introduces a generative feedback with latent variables into existing CNN architectures, making consistent predictions via alternating MAP inference under a Bayesian framework. CNN-F shows considerably better adversarial robustness over regular feedforward CNNs on standard benchmarks. In addition, With higher V4 and IT neural predictivity, CNN-F produces object representations closer to primate vision than conventional CNNs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6. Learning to Learn with Feedback and Local Plasticity\n\n*From Search Query: feedback mechanisms in feedforward networks*\n\n*Jack W Lindsey, Ashok Litwin-Kumar*\n\n**Abstract:** Interest in biologically inspired alternatives to backpropagation is driven by the desire to both advance connections between deep learning and neuroscience and address backpropagation's shortcomings on tasks such as online, continual learning. However, local synaptic learning rules like those employed by the brain have so far failed to match the performance of backpropagation in deep networks. In this study, we employ meta-learning to discover networks that learn using feedback connections and local, biologically inspired learning rules. Importantly, the feedback connections are not tied to the feedforward weights, avoiding biologically implausible weight transport. Our experiments show that meta-trained networks effectively use feedback connections to perform online credit assignment in multi-layer architectures. Surprisingly, this approach matches or exceeds a state-of-the-art gradient-based online meta-learning algorithm on regression and classification tasks, excelling in particular at continual learning. Analysis of the weight updates employed by these models reveals that they differ qualitatively from gradient descent in a way that reduces interference between updates. Our results suggest the existence of a class of biologically plausible learning mechanisms that not only match gradient descent-based learning, but also overcome its limitations.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 7. Weighted Mutual Learning with Diversity-Driven Model Compression\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory compression models*\n\n*Miao Zhang, Li Wang, David Campos, Wei Huang, Chenjuan Guo, B. Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A framework called Weighted Mutual Learning with Diversity-Driven Model Compression (WML), which outperforms existing online distillation methods on a variety of deep neural networks and produces a series of students with different model sizes in a single run, which also achieves competitive results compared with existing channel pruning methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Online distillation attracts attention from the community as it simplifies the traditional two-stage knowledge distillation process into a single stage. Online distillation collaboratively trains a group of peer models, which are treated as students, and all students gain extra knowledge from each other. However, memory consumption and diversity among students are two key challenges to the scalability and quality of online distillation. To address the two challenges, this paper presents a framework called Weighted Mutual Learning with Diversity-Driven Model Compression ( WML ) for online distillation. First, at the base of a hierarchical structure where students share different parts, we leverage the structured network pruning to generate diversified students with different models sizes, thus also helping reduce the memory requirements. Second, rather than taking the average of students, this paper, for the first time, leverages a bi-level formulation to estimate the relative importance of students with a close-form, to further boost the effectiveness of the distillation from each other. Extensive experiments show the generalization of the proposed framework, which outperforms existing online distillation methods on a variety of deep neural networks. More interesting, as a byproduct, WML produces a series of students with different model sizes in a single run, which also achieves competitive results compared with existing channel pruning methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8.

Inspired by Kanerva's sparse distributed memory, it has a robust distributed reading and writing mechanism. The memory is analytically tractable, which enables optimal on-line compression via a Bayesian update-rule. We formulate it as a hierarchical conditional generative model, where memory provides a rich data-dependent prior distribution. Consequently, the top-down memory and bottom-up perception are combined to produce the code representing an observation. Empirically, we demonstrate that the adaptive memory significantly improves generative models trained on both the Omniglot and CIFAR datasets. Compared with the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) and its variants, our memory model has greater capacity and is significantly easier to train.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 37  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 9. HiNeRV: Video Compression with Hierarchical Encoding based Neural Representation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory compression models*\n\n*Ho Man Kwan, Ge Gao, Fan Zhang, Andrew Gower, David R. Bull*\n\n**TL;DR:** HiNeRV is an INR that combines light weight layers with novel hierarchical positional encodings and employs depth-wise convolutional, MLP and interpolation layers to build the deep and wide network architecture with high capacity, which offers higher performance and flexibility than existing methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning-based video compression is currently a popular research topic, offering the potential to compete with conventional standard video codecs. In this context, Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have previously been used to represent and compress image and video content, demonstrating relatively high decoding speed compared to other methods. However, existing INR-based methods have failed to deliver rate quality performance comparable with the state of the art in video compression. This is mainly due to the simplicity of the employed network architectures, which limit their representation capability. In this paper, we propose HiNeRV, an INR that combines light weight layers with novel hierarchical positional encodings. We employs depth-wise convolutional, MLP and interpolation layers to build the deep and wide network architecture with high capacity. HiNeRV is also a unified representation encoding videos in both frames and patches at the same time, which offers higher performance and flexibility than existing methods. We further build a video codec based on HiNeRV and a refined pipeline for training, pruning and quantization that can better preserve HiNeRV's performance during lossy model compression. The proposed method has been evaluated on both UVG and MCL-JCV datasets for video compression, demonstrating significant improvement over all existing INRs baselines and competitive performance when compared to learning-based codecs (72.3% overall bit rate saving over HNeRV and 43.4% over DCVC on the UVG dataset, measured in PSNR).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Context-adaptive neural network based prediction for image compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression neural networks*\n\n*Thierry Dumas, Aline Roumy, Christine Guillemot*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper describes a set of neural network architectures, called Prediction Neural Networks Set (PNNS), based on both fully-connected and convolutional neural networks, for intra image prediction. The choice of neural network for predicting a given image block depends on the block size, hence does not need to be signalled to the decoder. It is shown that, while fully-connected neural networks give good performance for small block sizes, convolutional neural networks provide better predictions in large blocks with complex textures. Thanks to the use of masks of random sizes during training, the neural networks of PNNS well adapt to the available context that may vary, depending on the position of the image block to be predicted. When integrating PNNS into a H.265 codec, PSNR-rate performance gains going from 1.46% to 5.20% are obtained. These gains are on average 0.99% larger than those of prior neural network based methods. Unlike the H.265 intra prediction modes, which are each specialized in predicting a specific texture, the proposed PNNS can model a large set of complex textures.\n\n**Published:** 2018-07-17\n\n\n\n#### 2. Accelerating Deep Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Transfer Channel Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression neural networks*\n\n*Jindong Wang, Chaohui Yu, Zijing Wu, Yiqiang Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has recently received increasing\nattention from researchers. However, existing methods are computationally\nintensive due to the computation cost of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\nadopted by most work. To date, there is no effective network compression method\nfor accelerating these models. In this paper, we propose a unified Transfer\nChannel Pruning (TCP) approach for accelerating UDA models. TCP is capable of\ncompressing the deep UDA model by pruning less important channels while\nsimultaneously learning transferable features by reducing the cross-domain\ndistribution divergence. Therefore, it reduces the impact of negative transfer\nand maintains competitive performance on the target task. To the best of our\nknowledge, TCP is the first approach that aims at accelerating deep UDA models.\nTCP is validated on two benchmark datasets-Office-31 and ImageCLEF-DA with two\ncommon backbone networks-VGG16 and ResNet50. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat TCP achieves comparable or better classification accuracy than other\ncomparison methods while significantly reducing the computational cost. To be\nmore specific, in VGG16, we get even higher accuracy after pruning 26% floating\npoint operations (FLOPs); in ResNet50, we also get higher accuracy on half of\nthe tasks after pruning 12% FLOPs. We hope that TCP will open a new door for\nfuture research on accelerating transfer learning models.\n\n**Published:** 2019-03-25\n\n\n\n#### 3. Residual Attention Network for Image Classification\n\n*From Search Query: feedback mechanisms in feedforward networks*\n\n*Fei Wang, Honggang Zhang, Chen Qian, Mengqing Jiang, Xiaoou Tang, Xiaogang Wang, Shuo Yang, Cheng Li*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we propose \"Residual Attention Network\", a convolutional neural\nnetwork using attention mechanism which can incorporate with state-of-art feed\nforward network architecture in an end-to-end training fashion. Our Residual\nAttention Network is built by stacking Attention Modules which generate\nattention-aware features. The attention-aware features from different modules\nchange adaptively as layers going deeper. Inside each Attention Module,\nbottom-up top-down feedforward structure is used to unfold the feedforward and\nfeedback attention process into a single feedforward process. Importantly, we\npropose attention residual learning to train very deep Residual Attention\nNetworks which can be easily scaled up to hundreds of layers. Extensive\nanalyses are conducted on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets to verify the\neffectiveness of every module mentioned above.

Feedback Networks\n\n*From Search Query: feedback mechanisms in feedforward networks*\n\n*Jitendra Malik, Te-Lin Wu, Silvio Savarese, Amir R. Zamir, William Shen, Lin Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Currently, the most successful learning models in computer vision are based\non learning successive representations followed by a decision layer. This is\nusually actualized through feedforward multilayer neural networks, e.g.\nConvNets, where each layer forms one of such successive representations.\nHowever, an alternative that can achieve the same goal is a feedback based\napproach in which the representation is formed in an iterative manner based on\na feedback received from previous iteration's output.\n  We establish that a feedback based approach has several fundamental\nadvantages over feedforward: it enables making early predictions at the query\ntime, its output naturally conforms to a hierarchical structure in the label\nspace (e.g. a taxonomy), and it provides a new basis for Curriculum Learning.\nWe observe that feedback networks develop a considerably different\nrepresentation compared to feedforward counterparts, in line with the\naforementioned advantages. We put forth a general feedback based learning\narchitecture with the endpoint results on par or better than existing\nfeedforward networks with the addition of the above advantages. We also\ninvestigate several mechanisms in feedback architectures (e.g. skip connections\nin time) and design choices (e.g. feedback length). We hope this study offers\nnew perspectives in quest for more natural and practical learning models.\n\n**Conference:** feedback-networks-1\n\n**Published:** 2016-12-30\n\n\n\n#### 5. Residual Dense Network for Image Restoration\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory compression models*\n\n*Yu Kong, Yulun Zhang, Yapeng Tian, Bineng Zhong, Yun Fu*\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional neural network has recently achieved great success for image restoration (IR) and also offered hierarchical features. However, most deep CNN based IR models do not make full use of the hierarchical features from the original low-quality images, thereby achieving relatively-low performance. In this paper, we propose a novel residual dense network (RDN) to address this problem in IR. We fully exploit the hierarchical features from all the convolutional layers. Specifically, we propose residual dense block (RDB) to extract abundant local features via densely connected convolutional layers. RDB further allows direct connections from the state of preceding RDB to all the layers of current RDB, leading to a contiguous memory mechanism. To adaptively learn more effective features from preceding and current local features and stabilize the training of wider network, we proposed local feature fusion in RDB. After fully obtaining dense local features, we use global feature fusion to jointly and adaptively learn global hierarchical features in a holistic way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RDN with several representative IR applications, single image super-resolution, Gaussian image denoising, image compression artifact reduction, and image deblurring. Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets show that our RDN achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods for each IR task quantitatively and visually.\n\n**Published:** 2018-12-25\n\n\n\n#### 6. Self-Supervised Variational Auto-Encoders\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory compression models*\n\n*Jakub M. Tomczak, Ioannis Gatopoulos*\n\n**Abstract:** Density estimation, compression and data generation are crucial tasks in artificial intelligence. Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) constitute a single framework to achieve these goals. Here, we present a novel class of generative models, called self-supervised Variational Auto-Encoder (selfVAE), that utilizes deterministic and discrete variational posteriors. This class of models allows to perform both conditional and unconditional sampling, while simplifying the objective function. First, we use a single self-supervised transformation as a latent variable, where a transformation is either downscaling or edge detection. Next, we consider a hierarchical architecture, i.e., multiple transformations, and we show its benefits compared to the VAE. The flexibility of selfVAE in data reconstruction finds a particularly interesting use case in data compression tasks, where we can trade-off memory for better data quality, and vice-versa. We present performance of our approach on three benchmark image data (Cifar10, Imagenette64, and CelebA).\n\n**Conference:** self-supervised-variational-auto-encoders\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-05\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, several key aspects and references are particularly relevant:\n\n### Hierarchical Memory Structures\n\nThe proposal involves integrating hierarchical memory structures, which is a concept well-explored in various neural network architectures:\n\n- **MemTree**: This algorithm uses a dynamic, tree-structured memory representation to optimize the organization, retrieval, and integration of information. It organizes memory hierarchically, with each node encapsulating aggregated textual content and semantic embeddings, which is highly relevant to the proposed hierarchical memory structure.\n\n- **Hierarchical Multiscale RNNs**: These networks discover and exploit hierarchical structure in sequences, which aligns with the idea of hierarchical processing in the proposed model.\n\n### Dynamic Compression\n\nDynamic compression is crucial for efficient memory management and reducing computational overhead:\n\n- **Compressive Transformers**: These models compress past memories for long-range sequence learning, which is similar to the dynamic compression proposed. This approach has been shown to be efficient in handling long sequences.\n\n- **LoMA: Lossless Compressed Memory Attention**: This mechanism efficiently handles long sequences by compressing redundant information without losing critical data, which is directly relevant to the dynamic compression aspect of the proposal.\n\n### Feedback Mechanisms\n\nFeedback mechanisms are essential for enhancing the model's ability to capture complex dependencies:\n\n- **Addressing Some Limitations of Transformers with Feedback Memory**: This work introduces a feedback memory that serves as a recurrent connection between sequence blocks, allowing the model to keep track of long-term dependencies. This is similar to the feedback integration proposed in the HierarchicalCompressiveGatedMLP.\n\n- **TransformerFAM: Feedback Attention is Working Memory**: This study explores the use of feedback attention as a form of working memory, which can enhance the model's ability to process and retain information over long sequences.\n\n### Efficiency and Scalability\n\nThe proposal aims to be efficient and scalable:\n\n- **Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (h-GNN)**: While primarily focused on image matching, the h-GNN's approach to increasing network depth through hierarchical clustering and message passing can provide insights into how to manage complex information hierarchically and efficiently.\n\n### Implementation Feasibility\n\nImplementing these mechanisms within a GatedMLP framework requires careful consideration:\n\n- **Training Strategies and Stability**: Ensuring stable training with feedback loops and hierarchical memory structures is crucial. Studies on training strategies for similar models, such as the Recurrent Memory Transformer, can provide valuable insights.\n\n### Novelty Assessment\n\nTo assess the novelty of the proposal, it is important to compare it with existing models that integrate similar mechanisms:\n\n- **Comparison with Compressive Transformers and Memory-Augmented Neural Networks**: While these models use compression and memory management, the specific combination of hierarchical memory, dynamic compression, and feedback mechanisms within a GatedMLP framework may be unique. Conducting a thorough comparison with these models will help in assessing the novelty of the proposal.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\nTo further refine the proposal, the following search queries and areas of investigation are recommended:\n\n- **Adaptive Compression in Neural Networks**: Search for models that dynamically adjust compression ratios based on the content.\n- **Feedback Mechanisms in Feedforward Networks**: Investigate how feedback mechanisms are integrated into feedforward architectures like GatedMLP.\n- **Hierarchical Memory with Dynamic Compression in Language Models**: Look for studies that combine hierarchical memory structures with dynamic compression techniques specifically in language models.\n\nBy focusing on these areas and leveraging the insights from the referenced works, the researcher can develop a robust and novel autoregressive LM block that addresses the challenges of long-sequence processing, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

Towards mental time travel: a hierarchical memory for reinforcement learning agents (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Andrew Kyle Lampinen, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Andrea Banino, Felix Hill*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 38  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures), and is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning agents often forget details of the past, especially after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore\"mentally time-travel\"-- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/47 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2101.03961, 2021.

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/19 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/1506.02075, 2015.

We propose Feedback Attention Memory (FAM), a novel Transformer architecture that leverages a feedback loop to enable the network to attend to its own latent representations. This design fosters the emergence of working memory within the Transformer, allowing it to process indefinitely long sequences. TransformerFAM requires no additional weights, enabling seamless integration with pre-trained models. Our experiments show that TransformerFAM significantly improves Transformer performance on long-context tasks across various model sizes (1B, 8B, and 24B). These results showcase the potential to empower Large Language Models (LLMs) to process sequences of unlimited length.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/36 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\n9}$ |\n| BSWA 24B | 78.2 | 62.6 |\n| FAM 24B | $\\mathbf{7 8 . 5}$ | $\\mathbf{6 3 . 4}$ |\n\nTable 2: Summarizes GPT-3 performance on ranking and generative tasks.

Due to page limitations in the main paper, ablation studies are presented in Appendix B.4\n\n## 4 Related Work\n\nThere have been attempts to incorporate feedback mechanisms into the Transformer, but most of them involve feeding the output activations from the top layer to the bottom [57, 63] or to intermediate layers [27]. Since the top three layers in the Transformer are heavily focused on output reconstruction [45], we hypothesize that there is a significant representational gap between the top and other layers. In this paper, we propose a feedback mechanism between intermediate layers. There were papers that compressed information blockwise [21, 25, 31, 71, 72]. However, in those papers, the information was not propagated infinitely. Relevant prior work includes the use of recurrent cross-attention between blocks [52], enabling the propagation of compressed information to subsequent blocks. Additionally, incorporating feedback from a few upper layers has been used to integrate past information [61]. We propose TransformerFAM under the assumption that the human brain processes homogenous, heterogeneous, and feedback data with the same attention mechanism across distributed brain areas. Additional related works are presented in Appendix E\n\n## 5 Conclusion\n\nIn the film 'Memento' (2000), the protagonist struggles with anterograde amnesia, which means he can not remember anything before happened in the last 10 minutes, but his long-term memory is intact, He has to tattoo important information on his body to remember it.\n```\n\n#### 4. Recurrent Memory Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.90)\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/29 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nIn 2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5884-5888, 2018. doi: 10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8462506.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/24 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2404.05892, 2024.

Biological credit assignment through dynamic inversion of feedforward networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"feedforward network\" dynamic compression feedback*\n\n*William F. Podlaski, C. Machens*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that feedforward network transformations can be effectively inverted through dynamics, and derives this dynamic inversion from the perspective of feedback control, where the forward transformation is reused and dynamically interacts with fixed or random feedback to propagate error signals during the backward pass.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning depends on changes in synaptic connections deep inside the brain. In multilayer networks, these changes are triggered by error signals fed back from the output, generally through a stepwise inversion of the feedforward processing steps. The gold standard for this process -- backpropagation -- works well in artificial neural networks, but is biologically implausible. Several recent proposals have emerged to address this problem, but many of these biologically-plausible schemes are based on learning an independent set of feedback connections. This complicates the assignment of errors to each synapse by making it dependent upon a second learning problem, and by fitting inversions rather than guaranteeing them. Here, we show that feedforward network transformations can be effectively inverted through dynamics. We derive this dynamic inversion from the perspective of feedback control, where the forward transformation is reused and dynamically interacts with fixed or random feedback to propagate error signals during the backward pass. Importantly, this scheme does not rely upon a second learning problem for feedback because accurate inversion is guaranteed through the network dynamics. We map these dynamics onto generic feedforward networks, and show that the resulting algorithm performs well on several supervised and unsupervised datasets. We also link this dynamic inversion to Gauss-Newton optimization, suggesting a biologically-plausible approximation to second-order learning. Overall, our work introduces an alternative perspective on credit assignment in the brain, and proposes a special role for temporal dynamics and feedback control during learning.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2. Dynamic Model Pruning with Feedback\n\n*From Search Query: \"feedforward network\" dynamic compression feedback*\n\n*Tao Lin, Sebastian U. Stich, Luis Barba, D. Dmitriev, Martin Jaggi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel model compression method is proposed that generates a sparse trained model without additional overhead by allowing dynamic allocation of the sparsity pattern and incorporating feedback signal to reactivate prematurely pruned weights to obtain a performant sparse model in one single training pass.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks often have millions of parameters. This can hinder their deployment to low-end devices, not only due to high memory requirements but also because of increased latency at inference. We propose a novel model compression method that generates a sparse trained model without additional overhead: by allowing (i) dynamic allocation of the sparsity pattern and (ii) incorporating feedback signal to reactivate prematurely pruned weights we obtain a performant sparse model in one single training pass (retraining is not needed, but can further improve the performance). We evaluate the method on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and show that the obtained sparse models can reach the state-of-the-art performance of dense models and further that their performance surpasses all previously proposed pruning schemes (that come without feedback mechanisms).\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 182  (*Influential: 34*)\n\n#### 3.

Schmidhuber*\n\n**TL;DR:** DasNet harnesses the power of sequential processing to improve classification performance, by allowing the network to iteratively focus its internal attention on some of its convolutional filters.\n\n**Abstract:** Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN) are stationary and feedforward. They neither change their parameters during evaluation nor use feedback from higher to lower layers. Real brains, however, do. So does our Deep Attention Selective Network (dasNet) architecture. DasNets feedback structure can dynamically alter its convolutional filter sensitivities during classification. It harnesses the power of sequential processing to improve classification performance, by allowing the network to iteratively focus its internal attention on some of its convolutional filters. Feedback is trained through direct policy search in a huge million-dimensional parameter space, through scalable natural evolution strategies (SNES). On the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, dasNet outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2014\n\n**Citations:** 253  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Interpretable Preferences via Multi-Objective Reward Modeling and\n  Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"gated MLP\" hierarchical memory compression*\n\n*Haoxiang Wang, Wei Xiong, Tengyang Xie, Han Zhao, Tong Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the primary\nmethod for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. The\nRLHF process typically starts by training a reward model (RM) using human\npreference data. Conventional RMs are trained on pairwise responses to the same\nuser request, with relative ratings indicating which response humans prefer.\nThe trained RM serves as a proxy for human preferences. However, due to the\nblack-box nature of RMs, their outputs lack interpretability, as humans cannot\nintuitively understand why an RM thinks a response is good or not. As RMs act\nas human preference proxies, we believe they should be human-interpretable to\nensure that their internal decision processes are consistent with human\npreferences and to prevent reward hacking in LLM alignment. To build RMs with\ninterpretable preferences, we propose a two-stage approach: i) train an\nAbsolute-Rating Multi-Objective Reward Model (ArmoRM) with multi-dimensional\nabsolute-rating data, each dimension corresponding to a human-interpretable\nobjective (e.g., honesty, verbosity, safety); ii) employ a Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) strategy with a gating network that automatically selects the most\nsuitable reward objectives based on the context. We efficiently trained an\nArmoRM with Llama-3 8B and a gating network consisting of a shallow MLP on top\nof the ArmoRM. Our trained model, ArmoRM-Llama3-8B, obtains state-of-the-art\nperformance on RewardBench, a benchmark evaluating RMs for language modeling.\nNotably, the performance of our model surpasses the LLM-as-a-judge method with\nGPT-4 judges by a margin, and approaches the performance of the much larger\nNemotron-4 340B reward model.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-18T17:58:28Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-18T17:58:28Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Enhancing Temporal Modeling of Video LLMs via Time Gating\n\n*From Search Query: \"gated MLP\" hierarchical memory compression*\n\n*Zi-Yuan Hu, Yiwu Zhong, Shijia Huang, Michael R. Lyu, Liwei Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have achieved impressive performance\non video-and-language tasks, such as video question answering. However, most\nexisting Video LLMs neglect temporal information in video data, leading to\nstruggles with temporal-aware video understanding. To address this gap, we\npropose a Time Gating Video LLM (TG-Vid) designed to enhance temporal modeling\nthrough a novel Time Gating module (TG). The TG module employs a time gating\nmechanism on its sub-modules, comprising gating spatial attention, gating\ntemporal attention, and gating MLP. This architecture enables our model to\nachieve a robust understanding of temporal information within videos. Extensive\nevaluation of temporal-sensitive video benchmarks (i.e., MVBench, TempCompass,\nand NExT-QA) demonstrates that our TG-Vid model significantly outperforms the\nexisting Video LLMs. Further, comprehensive ablation studies validate that the\nperformance gains are attributed to the designs of our TG module.

Blockwise Parallel Transformer for Large Context Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"feedforward network\" dynamic compression feedback*\n\n*Hao Liu, Pieter Abbeel*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as the cornerstone of state-of-the-art natural\nlanguage processing models, showcasing exceptional performance across a wide\nrange of AI applications. However, the memory demands posed by the\nself-attention mechanism and the large feedforward network in Transformers\nlimit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby creating challenges for\ntasks involving multiple long sequences or long-term dependencies. We present a\ndistinct approach, Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT), that leverages\nblockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward network fusion to\nminimize memory costs. By processing longer input sequences while maintaining\nmemory efficiency, BPT enables training sequences 32 times longer than vanilla\nTransformers and up to 4 times longer than previous memory-efficient methods.\nExtensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of BPT in reducing memory requirements and\nimproving performance.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-30T19:25:51Z  (*Updated: 2023-08-28T20:13:33Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. NTK-approximating MLP Fusion for Efficient Language Model Fine-tuning\n\n*From Search Query: \"MLP\" hierarchical dynamic compression feedback*\n\n*Tianxin Wei, Zeming Guo, Yifan Chen, Jingrui He*\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning a pre-trained language model (PLM) emerges as the predominant\nstrategy in many natural language processing applications. However, even\nfine-tuning the PLMs and doing inference are expensive, especially on edge\ndevices with low computing power. Some general approaches (e.g. quantization\nand distillation) have been widely studied to reduce the compute/memory of PLM\nfine-tuning, while very few one-shot compression techniques are explored. In\nthis paper, we investigate the neural tangent kernel (NTK)--which reveals the\ngradient descent dynamics of neural networks--of the multilayer perceptrons\n(MLP) modules in a PLM and propose to coin a lightweight PLM through\nNTK-approximating MLP fusion. To achieve this, we reconsider the MLP as a\nbundle of sub-MLPs, and cluster them into a given number of centroids, which\ncan then be restored as a compressed MLP and surprisingly shown to well\napproximate the NTK of the original PLM. Extensive experiments of PLM\nfine-tuning on both natural language understanding (NLU) and generation (NLG)\ntasks are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method MLP\nfusion.

MLP-KAN: Unifying Deep Representation and Function Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"MLP\" hierarchical dynamic compression feedback*\n\n*Yunhong He, Yifeng Xie, Zhengqing Yuan, Lichao Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advancements in both representation learning and function learning\nhave demonstrated substantial promise across diverse domains of artificial\nintelligence. However, the effective integration of these paradigms poses a\nsignificant challenge, particularly in cases where users must manually decide\nwhether to apply a representation learning or function learning model based on\ndataset characteristics. To address this issue, we introduce MLP-KAN, a unified\nmethod designed to eliminate the need for manual model selection. By\nintegrating Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for representation learning and\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for function learning within a\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, MLP-KAN dynamically adapts to the\nspecific characteristics of the task at hand, ensuring optimal performance.\nEmbedded within a transformer-based framework, our work achieves remarkable\nresults on four widely-used datasets across diverse domains. Extensive\nexperimental evaluation demonstrates its superior versatility, delivering\ncompetitive performance across both deep representation and function learning\ntasks.

    "proposal": "## HierarchicalCompressiveGatedMLP: Multi-level Memory Organization with Dynamic Compression\n\n### 1. Motivation\n\nCurrent GatedMLP architectures face several challenges:\n- Limited ability to handle long sequences efficiently\n- High memory requirements for storing intermediate states\n- Fixed computation patterns regardless of input complexity\n- Inefficient information routing between layers\n\nThese limitations affect both model performance and computational efficiency. A more intelligent approach to memory management and information processing could significantly improve both aspects.\n\n### 2. Problem Analysis\n\nThe key issues with standard GatedMLP include:\n\n1. **Memory Management**:\n   - Uniform treatment of all intermediate states\n   - No mechanism for selective compression\n   - High memory requirements for long sequences\n\n2. **Information Processing**:\n   - Fixed computation patterns\n   - Limited ability to capture hierarchical relationships\n   - Inefficient routing of information between layers\n\n3. **Computational Efficiency**:\n   - Redundant computations for less important information\n   - No adaptation to input complexity\n   - Fixed memory allocation regardless of content importance\n\n### 3. Core Idea and Philosophy\n\nHierarchicalCompressiveGatedMLP introduces three key innovations:\n\n1. **Hierarchical Memory Organization**:\n   - Multi-level memory structure for different temporal scales\n   - Adaptive compression based on content importance\n   - Efficient information routing between levels\n\n2. **Dynamic Compression**:\n   - Content-adaptive compression ratios\n   - Lossless compression for critical information\n   - Progressive compression for less important content\n\n3. **Feedback Integration**:\n   - Cross-level feedback mechanisms\n   - Adaptive information routing\n   - Memory-aware computation\n\n### 4. Design Plan\n\n#### 4.1 Architecture Overview\n\nThe HierarchicalCompressiveGatedMLP consists of three main components:\n\n1. **Hierarchical Memory Module**:\n```python\nclass HierarchicalMemory(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, dim, num_levels=3):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.levels = nn.ModuleList([\n            MemoryLevel(dim, compression_ratio=2**i)\n            for i in range(num_levels)\n        ])\n        self.router = ContentRouter(dim, num_levels)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Route information to appropriate levels\n        routing_weights = self.router(x)\n        memories = []\n        for i, level in enumerate(self.levels):\n            memories.append(level(x, routing_weights[:, i]))\n        return self.combine_memories(memories)\n```\n\n2. **Dynamic Compression Unit**:\n```python\nclass DynamicCompression(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, dim):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.importance_estimator = nn.Linear(dim, 1)\n        self.compressor = AdaptiveCompressor(dim)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Estimate importance scores\n        scores = self.importance_estimator(x)\n        # Apply adaptive compression\n        return self.compressor(x, scores)\n```\n\n3. **Feedback Integration Layer**:\n```python\nclass FeedbackLayer(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, dim):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.feedback_gate = nn.Linear(dim * 2, dim)\n        self.memory_gate = nn.Linear(dim * 2, dim)\n        \n    def forward(self, x, memory):\n        # Combine current input with memory feedback\n        combined = torch.cat([x, memory], dim=-1)\n        f_gate = torch.sigmoid(self.feedback_gate(combined))\n        m_gate = torch.sigmoid(self.memory_gate(combined))\n        return x * f_gate + memory * m_gate\n```\n\n#### 4.2 Mathematical Formulation\n\n1. **Hierarchical Memory**:\n   \\[\n   M_l = \\text{CompressAndStore}(X, r_l)\n   \\]\n   where $M_l$ is the memory at level $l$, $r_l$ is the compression ratio.\n\n2. **Dynamic Compression**:\n   \\[\n   C(X) = X \\odot \\sigma(W_c X + b_c)\n   \\]\n   where $C(X)$ is the compressed representation.\n\n3. **Feedback Integration**:\n   \\[\n   Y = X \\odot G_f(X, M) + M \\odot G_m(X, M)\n   \\]\n   where $G_f$ and $G_m$ are feedback and memory gates.\n\n### 5. Implementation Guidelines\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n```python\nclass HierarchicalCompressiveGatedMLP(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, config):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.hierarchical_memory = HierarchicalMemory(config.dim)\n        self.dynamic_compressor = DynamicCompression(config.dim)\n        self.feedback_layer = FeedbackLayer(config.dim)\n        self.mlp = GatedMLP(config.dim)\n```\n\n2. **Forward Pass**:\n```python\ndef forward(self, x, memory_state=None):\n    # Process through hierarchical memory\n    memory_out = self.hierarchical_memory(x)\n    \n    # Apply dynamic compression\n    compressed = self.dynamic_compressor(memory_out)\n    \n    # Integrate feedback\n    if memory_state is not None:\n        compressed = self.feedback_layer(compressed, memory_state)\n    \n    # Process through MLP\n    return self.mlp(compressed)\n```\n\n### 6. Theoretical Analysis\n\n1. **Computational Complexity**:\n- Base MLP: O(nd) where n is sequence length, d is dimension\n- Hierarchical memory: O(n log n) due to multi-level processing\n- Overall complexity: O(n log n)\n\n2. **Memory Usage**:\n- Hierarchical storage: O(n/c) where c is average compression ratio\n- Dynamic compression: O(d) additional parameters\n- Total memory: O(n/c + d)\n\n3. **Expected Benefits**:\n- Improved handling of long sequences\n- Reduced memory requirements\n- Better information routing\n- Enhanced model expressiveness\n\n### 7.
