    "abstract": "In this paper we describe several novel sparsification techniques used in a fast stochastic integral equation solver to compute the mean value and the variance of capacitance of 3D interconnects with random surface roughness. With the combination of these numerical techniques, the computational cost has been reduced from O(N/sup 4/) to O(Nlog/sup 2/(N)), where N is the number of panels used for the discretization of nominal smooth surfaces. Numerical experiments show that the proposed numerical techniques are accurate and efficient.",
