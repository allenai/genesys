    "title": "The Exponentially Weighted Moving Average",
    "abstract": "In this tutorial, the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) is discussed. The EWMA is often used for smoothing irregular fluctuations (i.e., noise) in a time series to permit the data analyst to better reveal trend/cycle patterns over time. Additionally, the EWMA is frequently used to compute short-term forecasts of time series (e.g., sales and stocks). Some common applications of the EWMA in the management science and quality engineering disciplines are discussed. Further, some properties of the EWMA, such as the expected value, variance, and one-step ahead prediction variance are also discussed. \n \n \nKeywords: \n \nexponentially weighed moving average; \ntime series forecasts; \nautoregressive process; \nautocorrelation matrix; \ntime series smoothing; \nsales forecasting; \nstatistical process control",
