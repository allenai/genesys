    "title": "Equilateral Triangles: A Challenge for Connectionist Vision",
    "abstract": "In this paper we explore the problem of dynamically computing visual relations in a connectionist system. The task. of detecting equilateral triangles from clusters of points is used to test our architecture. We argue that this is a difficult task for traditional feed-forward architectures although it is a simple task for people. Our solution implements a biologically inspired networlc which uses an efficient focus of attention mecha\u00ad nism and cluster detectors to sequentially extract the locations of the vertices.",
