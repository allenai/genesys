    "title": "A Natural Logic Inference System",
    "abstract": "This paper develops a version of Natural Logic \u2013 an inference system that works directly on natural language syntactic representations, with no int ermediate translation to logical formulae. Following work by S\u00e1nchez (1991), we develop a small fragment t ha computes semantic order relations between derivation trees in Categorial Grammar. Unlike pre vious works, the proposed system has the following new characteristics: (i) It uses orderings betwe en derivation trees as purely syntactic units, derivable by a formal calculus. (ii) The system is extended f or conjunctive phenomena like coordination and relative clauses. This allows a simple account of non -m otonic expressions that are reducible to conjunctions of monotonic ones. (iii) A preliminary proof s earch algorithm based on a tree generating regular system is developed for S\u00e1nchez\u2019 smaller fragment of Natural Logic.",
