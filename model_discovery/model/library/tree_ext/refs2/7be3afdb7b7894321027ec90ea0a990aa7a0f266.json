    "abstract": "I focus on three characteristics of natural language understanding systems that incorporate the properties that make humans able to understand language naturally. The first characteristic of such systems is that they handle recursion. A second property of these systems is that they process abstract hierarchical structures, and they are not limited to the processing of strings of characters or keywords. A third characteristic is that they connect physical forms and interpretations.",
