    "title": "Review on the Selection of Health Indicator for Lithium Ion Batteries",
    "abstract": "Scientifically and accurately predicting the state of health (SOH) and remaining useful life (RUL) of batteries is the key technology of automotive battery management systems. The selection of the health indicator (HI) that characterizes battery aging affects the accuracy of the prediction model construction, which in turn affects the accuracy of SOH and RUL estimation. Therefore, this paper analyzes the current status of HI selection for lithium-ion batteries by systematically reviewing the existing literature on the selection of HIs. According to the relationship between HI and battery aging, battery HI can be divided into two categories: direct HI and indirect HI. The capacity and internal resistance of the battery can directly represent the aging degree of the battery and are the direct HIs of the battery. Indirect HIs refer to characteristic parameters extracted from battery charge and discharge data that can characterize the degree of battery aging. This paper analyzes and summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of various HIs and indirect HIs commonly used in current research, providing useful support and reference for future researchers in selecting HIs to characterize battery aging. Finally, in view of the capacity regeneration phenomenon in the aging process of the battery, the selection direction of future HI is proposed.",
