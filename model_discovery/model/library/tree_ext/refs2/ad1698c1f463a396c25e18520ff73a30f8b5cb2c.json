    "abstract": "The information capacity of general forms of memory is formalized. The number of bits of information that can be stored in the Hopfield model of associative memory is estimated. It is found that the asymptotic information capacity of a Hopfield network of N neurons is of the order N^{3} b. The number of arbitrary state vectors that can be made stable in a Hopfield network of N neurons is proved to be bounded above by N .",
