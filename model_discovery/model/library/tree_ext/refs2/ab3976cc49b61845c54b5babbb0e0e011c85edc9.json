    "title": "Fast Discrete Polynomial Transforms with Applications to Data Analysis for Distance Transitive Graphs",
    "abstract": "Let $\\poly = \\{P_0,\\dots,P_{n-1}\\}$ denote a set of polynomials with complex coefficients. Let $\\pts = \\{z_0,\\dots,z_{n-1}\\}\\subset \\cplx$ denote any set of {\\it sample points}. For any $f = (f_0,\\dots,f_{n-1}) \\in \\cplx^n$, the {\\it discrete polynomial transform} of $f$ (with respect to $\\poly$ and $\\pts$) is defined as the collection of sums, $\\{\\fhat(P_0),\\dots,\\fhat(P_{n-1})\\}$, where $\\fhat(P_j) = \\langle f,P_j \\rangle = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f_iP_j(z_i)w(i)$ for some associated weight function $w$. These sorts of transforms find important applications in areas such as medical imaging and signal processing. \nIn this paper, we present fast algorithms for computing discrete orthogonal polynomial transforms. For a system of $N$ orthogonal polynomials of degree at most $N-1$, we give an $O(N\\log^2 N)$ algorithm for computing a discrete polynomial transform at an arbitrary set of points instead of the $N^2$ operations required by direct evaluation. Our algorithm depends only on the fact that orthogonal polynomial sets satisfy a three-term recurrence and thus it may be applied to any such set of discretely sampled functions. \nIn particular, sampled orthogonal polynomials generate the vector space of functions on a distance transitive graph. As a direct application of our work, we are able to give a fast algorithm for computing subspace decompositions of this vector space which respect the action of the symmetry group of such a graph. This has direct applications to treating computational bottlenecks in the spectral analysis of data on distance transitive graphs, and we discuss this in some detail.",
