    "title": "An Efficient Recognition and Syntax-Analysis Algorithm for Context-Free Languages",
    "abstract": "Abstract : An efficient algorithm of recognition and syntaxanalysis for the full class of context-free languages without the difficulty of exponential growth of computing time with the length n of input sequence is presented. This algorithm makes use of the essential property of a context-free language as a multi-parenthesis system. It is shown in this paper that a context-free language is n cubed-recognizable in the sense of Hartmanis and Stearns ('Computational complexity of recursive sequences'. Proc. Fifth Annual Symposium of Switching Circuit Theory and Logical Design (Oct. 1964) p.82-90) by a double-tape or double-head single-tape Turing machine and it is n to the 4th power-recognizable by a single-head single-tape Turing machine. If we use a random-access memory whose size is proportional to n cubed, the computing time required for syntaxanalysis is upperbounded by C(1)n cubed + C(2)n squared N, where N denotes the number of nonequivalent valid derivation sequences for a given input sequence and C(i)'s are constants independent of input sequences. If we use a tape of length C(3)n cubed and one of length C(4)n squared as working memories, the computing time for syntax-analysis is upperbounded by C(5)n cubed (1 + N). The size of required memory can be reduced to the order of n squared, but the computing time rises to the order of n to the 4th power. (Author)",
