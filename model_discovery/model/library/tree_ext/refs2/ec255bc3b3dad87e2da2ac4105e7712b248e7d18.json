    "abstract": "A sequence is increasing if for all values of n, an < an+1; a sequence is decreasing if for all values of n, an > an+1. A monotonic sequence is either increasing or decreasing. A sequence is bounded above if there exists a number M such that M > an and bounded below if there is a number m such that m < an . A bounded sequence is bounded both above and below. Theorem 5) A bounded monotonic sequence converges.",
