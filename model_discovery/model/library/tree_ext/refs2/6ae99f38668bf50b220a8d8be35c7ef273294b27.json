    "title": "Generalized sliding FFT and its application to implementation of block LMS adaptive filters",
    "abstract": "This paper has two contributions. First, the concept of the generalized sliding fast Fourier transform (GSFFT) as an efficient implementation of the hopping FFT is introduced. Application of the GSFFT is broad and not limited to what has been considered in this paper. The frequency domain block LMS (FBLMS) adaptive filters are then revised, and their implementations for block lengths less than the length of the adaptive filter are studied. The GSFFT and the available pruned FFTs are used to give an efficient implementation of these filters. In the particular case of the block length equal to one, where the FBLMS algorithm reduces to the frequency domain LMS (FLMS) algorithm, it is shown that the latter can be implemented with the order of M complexity, where M is the length of the adaptive filter. >",
