    "abstract": "A problem of practical importance is the statistical estimation of the parameters (0', , Ov): Let the result of n independent observations of x made on the assumption that (0,, , 0G) is fixed yield the numbers Xl. * Xn,-the \"sample\"; assuming nothing known a priori concerning the position of (01, v, 0) in Q, so that Bayes' formula is inapplicable, how can the sample xi, , xn be used to secure information regarding (0,, * *, Ov)? According to R. A. Fishert this problem is to be solved by finding v functions of n arguments, 4j(x,, * . , xI,) (j = 1, , v), such that when the arguments are replaced by the values in the sample, the resulting values are the appropriate values of 0i. The question of how appropriateness is to be determined has its roots deep in the foundations of the subject, and will not be considered here. The function qj is called by R. A. Fisher an estimate of Oi, or a statistic. Assuming that the statistics 4 (j = 1, * , v) exist, a question arises immediately which, stated intuitively, runs as follows: does the position of the single point (01(x1, . . . , xn), . , 4,(xi, . . , x,)) in Q \"contain all the information\" relative to the position of (0,, , 0,) \"contained in the sample\" of n numbers (xi, * * . , x,) when (as is usual) n >v? Or is \"relevant information\" lost when xi, , xn are discarded and only the numbers",
