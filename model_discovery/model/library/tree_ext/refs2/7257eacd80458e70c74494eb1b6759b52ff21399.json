    "title": "Using fast weights to deblur old memories",
    "abstract": "Connectionist models usually have a single weight on each connection. Some interesting new properties emerge if each connection has two weights: A slowly changing, plastic weight which stores long-term knowledge and a fast-changing, elastic weight which stores temporary knowledge and spontaneously decays towards zero. If a network learns a set of associations and then these associations are \"blurred\" by subsequent learning, all the original associations can be \"deblurred\" by rehearsing on just a few of them. The rehearsal allows the fast weights to take on values that temporarily cancel out the changes in the slow weights caused by the subsequent learning.",
