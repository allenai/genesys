    "title": "On the theory of linear multi-loop feedback systems",
    "abstract": "It is well known that the concept of return difference plays a central role in the classical theory of linear feedback systems developed by Black, Nyquist, Blackman and Bode. This concept, which relates to the influence of a single algebraic system-constraint of the form f 2 = \u03b3f 1 where f 1 and f 2 respectively may be regarded as a controlling signal and a controlled signal, retains its prominence in the subsequent signal-flow graph theoretic extensions by Mason. It is particularly pertinent to the study of the stability of the system, its degree of immunity from parameter variations, and the determination of its transmission and driving-point properties. This paper reports on a generalization of Blackman's equation and on some generalizations of Bode's return difference theorems. Here attention is focused not on a single constraint of the form f 2 = \u03b3f 1 , but instead on a set of constraining equations.",
