    "title": "Improved backing-off for M-gram language modeling",
    "abstract": "In stochastic language modeling, backing-off is a widely used method to cope with the sparse data problem. In case of unseen events this method backs off to a less specific distribution. In this paper we propose to use distributions which are especially optimized for the task of backing-off. Two different theoretical derivations lead to distributions which are quite different from the probability distributions that are usually used for backing-off. Experiments show an improvement of about 10% in terms of perplexity and 5% in terms of word error rate.",
