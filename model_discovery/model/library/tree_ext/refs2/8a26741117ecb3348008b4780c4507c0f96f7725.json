    "title": "Fast algorithms for the computation of sliding discrete sinusoidal transforms",
    "abstract": "Fast algorithms for computing various discrete cosine transforms and discrete sine transforms in a sliding window are proposed. The algorithms are based on a recursive relationship between three subsequent local transform spectra. Efficient inverse algorithms for signal processing in a sliding window are also presented. The computational complexity of the algorithms is compared with that of known fast discrete sinusoidal transforms and running recursive algorithms.",
