    "title": "A Lyapunov approach to incremental stability properties",
    "abstract": "Deals with several notions of incremental stability. In other words, the focus is on stability of trajectories with respect to one another, rather than with respect to some attractor. The aim is to present a framework for understanding such questions fully compatible with the well-known input-to-state stability approach. Applications of the newly introduced stability notions are also discussed.",
