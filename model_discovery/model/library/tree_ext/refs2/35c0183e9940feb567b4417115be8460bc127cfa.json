    "title": "Linear System Theory and Design",
    "abstract": "From the Publisher: \nAn extensive revision of the author's highly successful text, this third edition of Linear System Theory and Design has been made more accessible to students from all related backgrounds. After introducing the fundamental properties of linear systems, the text discusses design using state equations and transfer functions. The two main objectives of the text are to: use simple and efficient methods to develop results and design procedures; enable students to employ the results to carry out design. Striking a balance between theory and applications, Linear System Theory and Design, 3/e, is ideal for use in advanced undergraduate/first-year graduate courses in linear systems and multivariable system design in electrical, mechanical, chemical, and aeronautical engineering departments. It assumes a working knowledge of linear algebra and the Laplace transform and an elementary knowledge of differential equations.",
