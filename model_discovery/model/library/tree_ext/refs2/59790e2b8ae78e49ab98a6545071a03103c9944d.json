    "abstract": "In putting together this issue of CiSE, we knew three things: it would be difficult to list just 10 algorithms; it would be fun to assemble the authors and read their papers; and, whatever we came up with in the end, it would be controversial. We tried to assemble the 10 algorithms with the greatest influence on the development and practice of science and engineering in the 20th century. Following is our list (in chronological order):Metropolis Algorithm for Monte CarloSimplex Method for Linear ProgrammingKrylov Subspace Iteration MethodsThe Decompositional Approach to Matrix ComputationsThe Fortran Optimizing CompilerQR Algorithm for Computing EigenvaluesQuicksort Algorithm for SortingFast Fourier TransformInteger Relation DetectionFast Multipole Method",
