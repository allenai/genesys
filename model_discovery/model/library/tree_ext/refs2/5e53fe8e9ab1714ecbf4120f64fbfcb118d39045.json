    "title": "Cardiac arrhythmias detection in an ECG beat signal using fast fourier transform and artificial neural network",
    "abstract": "Cardiac Arrhythmias shows a condition of abnor-mal electrical activity in the heart which is a threat to humans. This paper presents a method to analyze electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, extract the fea-tures, for the classification of heart beats according to different arrhythmias. Data were obtained from 40 records of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (only one lead). Cardiac arrhythmias which are found are Tachycardia, Bradycardia, Supraventricular Tachycardia, Incomplete Bundle Branch Block, Bundle Branch Block, Ventricular Tachycardia. A learning dataset for the neural network was obtained from a twenty records set which were manually classified using MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database Directory and docu- mentation, taking advantage of the professional experience of a cardiologist. Fast Fourier transforms are used to identify the peaks in the ECG signal and then Neural Networks are applied to identify the diseases. Levenberg Marquardt Back-Propagation algorithm is used to train the network. The results obtained have better efficiency then the previously proposed methods.",
