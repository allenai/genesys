    "title": "Three free data sets for development and benchmarking in nonlinear system identification",
    "abstract": "System identification is a fundamentally experimental field of science in that it deals with modeling of system dynamics using measured data. Despite this fact many algorithms and theoretical results are only tested with simulations at the time of publication. One reason for this may be a lack of easily available live data. This paper therefore presents three sets of data, suitable for development, testing and benchmarking of system identification algorithms for nonlinear systems. The data sets are collected from laboratory processes that can be described by block - oriented dynamic models, and by more general nonlinear difference and differential equation models. All data sets are available for free download.",
