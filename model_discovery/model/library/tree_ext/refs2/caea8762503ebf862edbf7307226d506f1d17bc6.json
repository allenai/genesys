    "title": "A State-space Neural Network for Modeling Dynamical Nonlinear Systems",
    "abstract": "In this paper, a specific neural-based model for identification of dynamical nonlinear systems is proposed. This artificial neural network, called State-Space Neural Network (SSNN), is different from other existing neural networks. Indeed, it uses a state-space representation while being able to adapt and learn its parameters. These parameters are the neural weights which are intelligible or understandable. After learning, the SSNN therefore is able to provide a state-space model of the dynamical nonlinear system. Examples are presented which show the capability of the SSNN for identification of multivariate dynamical nonlinear systems.",
