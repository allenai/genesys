    "title": "Weather forecasting using deep learning techniques",
    "abstract": "Weather forecasting has gained attention many researchers from various research communities due to its effect to the global human life. The emerging deep learning techniques in the last decade coupled with the wide availability of massive weather observation data and the advent of information and computer technology have motivated many researches to explore hidden hierarchical pattern in the large volume of weather dataset for weather forecasting. This study investigates deep learning techniques for weather forecasting. In particular, this study will compare prediction performance of Recurrence Neural Network (RNN), Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (CRBM), and Convolutional Network (CN) models. Those models are tested using weather dataset provided by BMKG (Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics) which are collected from a number of weather stations in Aceh area from 1973 to 2009 and El-Nino Southern Oscilation (ENSO) data set provided by International Institution such as National Weather Service Center for Environmental Prediction Climate (NOAA). Forecasting accuracy of each model is evaluated using Frobenius norm. The result of this study expected to contribute to weather forecasting for wide application domains including flight navigation to agriculture and tourism.",
