    "abstract": "Algorithms for encoding and decoding finite strings over a finite alphabet are described. The coding operations are arithmetic involving rational numbers li as parameters such that \u03a3i2-l i\u22642-\u2208. This coding technique requires no blocking, and the per-symbol length of the encoded string approaches the associated entropy within \u2208. The coding speed is comparable to that of conventional coding methods.",
