    "title": "Fast Computation of Sliding Discrete Tchebichef Moments and Its Application in Duplicated Regions Detection",
    "abstract": "Computational load remains a major concern when processing signals by means of sliding transforms. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for the fast computation of one-dimensional and two-dimensional sliding discrete Tchebichef moments. To do so, we first establish the relationships that exist between the Tchebichef moments of two neighboring windows taking advantage of Tchebichef polynomials' properties. We then propose an original way to fast compute the moments of one window by utilizing the moment values of its previous window. We further theoretically establish the complexity of our fast algorithm and illustrate its interest within the framework of digital forensics and more precisely the detection of duplicated regions in an audio signal or an image. Our algorithm is used to extract local features of such a signal tampering. Experimental results show that its complexity is independent of the window size, validating the theory. They also exhibit that our algorithm is suitable to digital forensics and beyond to any applications based on sliding Tchebichef moments.",
