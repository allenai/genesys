    "title": "Margin Maximizing Loss Functions",
    "abstract": "Margin maximizing properties play an important role in the analysis of classification models, such as boosting and support vector machines. Margin maximization is theoretically interesting because it facilitates generalization error analysis, and practically interesting because it presents a clear geometric interpretation of the models being built. We formulate and prove a sufficient condition for the solutions of regularized loss functions to converge to margin maximizing separators, as the regularization vanishes. This condition covers the hinge loss of SVM, the exponential loss of AdaBoost and logistic regression loss. We also generalize it to multi-class classification problems, and present margin maximizing multi-class versions of logistic regression and support vector machines.",
