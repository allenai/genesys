    "title": "Structured Matrices and Polynomials: Unified Superfast Algorithms",
    "abstract": "Structure matrices serve as a natural bridge between the areas of algebraic computations with polynomials and numerical matrix computations, allowing cross-fertilization of both fields. This book covers most fundamental numerical and algebraic computations with Toeplitz, Hankel, Vandermonde, Cauchy, and other popular structured matrices. Throughout the computations, the matrices are represented by their compressed images, called displacements, enabling both a unified treatment of various matrix structures and dramatic saving of computer time and memory. The resulting superfast algorithms allow further dramatic parallel acceleration using FFT and fast sine and cosine transforms.",
