    "title": "Parallel Prefix Computation",
    "abstract": "The prefix problem is to compute all the products x t o x2 . . . . o xk for i ~ k .~ n, where o is an associative operation A recurstve construction IS used to obtain a product circuit for solving the prefix problem which has depth exactly [log:n] and size bounded by 4n An application yields fast, small Boolean ctrcmts to simulate fimte-state transducers. By simulating a sequentml adder, a Boolean clrcmt which has depth 2[Iog2n] + 2 and size bounded by 14n Is obtained for n-bit binary addmon The size can be decreased significantly by permitting the depth to increase by an addmve constant",
