    "abstract": "Humans talk in free-form while negotiating the expressed meanings or common ground. Despite the impressive conversational abilities of the large generative language models, they do not consider the individual differences in contextual understanding in a shared situated environment. In this work, we propose MindDial, a novel conversational framework that can generate situated free-form responses to negotiate common ground. We design an explicit mind module that can track three-level beliefs \u2013 the speaker\u2019s belief, the speaker\u2019s prediction of the listener\u2019s belief, and the common belief based on the gap between the \ufb01rst two. Then the speaking act classi\ufb01cation head will decide to continue to talk, end this turn, or take task-related action. We augment a common ground alignment dataset MutualFriend [1] with belief dynamics annotation, of which the goal is to \ufb01nd a single mutual friend based on the free chat between two agents. Experiments show that our model with mental state modeling can resemble human responses when",
