    "abstract": "In recent years, neural networks based on attention mechanisms have seen increasingly use in speech recognition, separation, and enhancement, as well as other fields. In particular, the convolution-augmented transformer has performed well, as it can combine the advantages of convolution and self-attention. Recently, the gated attention unit (GAU) was proposed. Compared with traditional multi-head self-attention, approaches with GAU are effective and computationally efficient. In this CGA-MGAN: MetricGAN based on Convolution-augmented Gated Attention for Speech Enhancement, we propose a network for speech enhancement called CGA-MGAN, a kind of MetricGAN based on convolution-augmented gated attention. CGA-MGAN captures local and global correlations in speech signals at the same time by fusing convolution and gated attention units. Experiments on Voice Bank + DEMAND show that our proposed CGA-MGAN model achieves excellent performance (3.47 PESQ, 0.96 STOI, and 11.09 dB SSNR) with a relatively small model size (1.14 M).",
