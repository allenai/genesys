    "abstract": "Contracts underlie most modern commercial transactions defining define the duties and obligations of the related parties in an agreement. Ensuring such agreements are error free is crucial for modern society and their analysis of a contract requires understanding the logical relations between clauses and identifying potential contradictions. This analysis depends on error-prone human effort to understand each contract clause. In this work, we develop an approach to automate the extraction of logical relations between clauses in a contract. We address this problem as a Natural Language Inference task to detect the entailment type between two clauses in a contract. The resulting approach should help contract authors detecting potential logical conflicts between clauses.",
