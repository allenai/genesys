    "abstract": "In this paper, we compare two different approaches to language understanding for a human-robot interaction domain in which a human commander gives navigation instructions to a robot. We contrast a relevance-based classifier with a GPT-2 model, using about 2000 input-output examples as training data. With this level of training data, the relevance-based model outperforms the GPT-2 based model 79% to 8%. We also present a taxonomy of types of errors made by each model, indicating that they have somewhat different strengths and weaknesses, so we also examine the potential for a combined model.",
