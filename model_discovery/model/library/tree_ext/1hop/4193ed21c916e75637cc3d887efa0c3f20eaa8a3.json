    "abstract": "In this paper, we report our participation in the TREC 2022 Health Misinformation Track. With the aim to foster research on retrieval algorithms to promote correct information over misinformation for health-related queries, this year\u2019s track had two tasks: web retrieval and answer prediction. We reused our previous method with minor modifications to create our baselines. To overcome some limitations of our previous methods, we investigated a document-aware sentence-level passage extraction model based on the BigBird transformer. The upgraded pipeline with this model achieved our best automatic performance on the web retrieval task but failed to beat our base-lines on the answer prediction task. Meanwhile, our manual runs still outperformed our automatic runs by great margins on both tasks, showing room for further improvements.",
