    "abstract": "Most of the existing aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) models only predict the sentiment polarity of a single aspect at a time, focusing primarily on enhancing the representation of this single aspect based on the other contexts or aspects. This one-to-one paradigm ignores the fact that multi-aspect, multi-sentiment sentences contain not only distinct specific descriptions for distinct specific aspects, but also shared global context information for multiple aspects. To fully consider these issues, we propose a one-to-many ABSA framework, called You Only Read Once (YORO), that can simultaneously model representations of all aspects based on their specific descriptions and better fuse their relationships using globally shared contextual information in the sentence. Predicting the sentiment polarity of multiple aspects simultaneously is beneficial to improving the efficacy of calculation and prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets (MAMS, Rest14, and Lap14). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of YORO in handling multi-aspect, multi-sentiment scenarios and highlight the promise of one-to-many ABSA in balancing efficiency and accuracy.",
