    "abstract": "Geological named entity recognition (NER) is an essential prerequisite to realizing geological information extraction and information retrieval and is an actual means for accomplishing structured reconstruction of unstructured geological data. Existing geological NER methods mainly focus on coarse\u2010grained geological entity recognition, but geological entities are fine\u2010grained. To solve this problem, a Chinese fine\u2010grained geological entity corpus encompassing 21 types of fine\u2010grained labels is constructed. In addition, in this article, a fine\u2010grained geological entity recognition model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT)\u2010Flat\u2010Lattice Transformer is designed. This paper names this method FGNER (Fine\u2010grained Geological Named Entity Recognition) which adds geological naming rules to revise the model results to improve the recognition of complex geological entities. The fine\u2010grained geological entity recognition method is evaluated using regional geological literature reports as experimental data. The experimental results show that the precision, recall, and F1\u2010score of the FGNER model are 95.73%, 89.26%, and 92.05%, respectively, thus achieving better performance than baseline models, such as BERT\u2010Conditional Random Field.",
