    "abstract": "We present C ASSINI , a network-aware job scheduler for machine learning (ML) clusters. C ASSINI introduces a novel geometric abstraction to consider the communication pattern of different jobs while placing them on network links. To do so, C ASSINI uses an Affinity graph that finds a series of time-shift values to adjust the communication phases of a subset of jobs such that the communication patterns of jobs sharing the same network link are interleaved with each other. Experiments with 13 common ML models on a 24-server testbed demonstrate that compared to the state-of-the-art ML schedulers, C ASSINI improves the average and tail completion time of jobs by up to 1.6 \u00d7 and 2.5 \u00d7 , respectively. Moreover, we show that C ASSINI reduces the number of ECN marked packets in the cluster by up to 33 \u00d7 .",
