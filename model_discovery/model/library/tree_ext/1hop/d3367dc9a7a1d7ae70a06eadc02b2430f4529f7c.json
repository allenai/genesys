    "abstract": "The human ability to learn, generalize, and control complex manipulation tasks through multi-modality feedback suggests a unique capability, which we refer to as dexterity intelligence. Understanding and assessing this intelligence is a complex task. Amidst the swift progress and extensive proliferation of large language models (LLMs), their applications in the field of robotics have garnered increasing attention. LLMs possess the ability to process and generate natural language, facilitating efficient interaction and collaboration with robots. Researchers and engineers in the field of robotics have recognized the immense potential of LLMs in enhancing robot intelligence, human-robot interaction, and autonomy. Therefore, this comprehensive review aims to summarize the applications of LLMs in robotics, delving into their impact and contributions to key areas such as robot control, perception, decision-making, and path planning. We first provide an overview of the background and development of LLMs for robotics, followed by a description of the benefits of LLMs for robotics and recent advancements in robotics models based on LLMs. We then delve into the various techniques used in the model, including those employed in perception, decision-making, control, and interaction. Finally, we explore the applications of LLMs in robotics and some potential challenges they may face in the near future. Embodied intelligence is the future of intelligent science, and LLMs-based robotics is one of the promising but challenging paths to achieve this.",
