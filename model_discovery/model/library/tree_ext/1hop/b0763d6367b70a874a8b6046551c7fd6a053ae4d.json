    "abstract": "Lane detection is the cornerstone of autonomous driving. Although existing methods have achieved promising results, there are still limitations in addressing challenging scenarios such as abnormal weather, occlusion, and curves. These scenarios with low visibility usually require to rely on the broad information of the entire scene provided by global semantics and local texture information to predict the precise position and shape of the lane lines. In this paper, we propose a Global Semantic Enhancement Network for lane detection, which involves a complete set of systems for feature extraction and global features transmission. Traditional methods for global feature extraction usually require deep convolution layer stacks. However, this approach of obtaining global features solely through a larger receptive field not only fails to capture precise global features but also leads to an overly deep model, which results in slow inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose a novel operation called the Global feature Extraction Module (GEM). Additionally, we introduce the Top Layer Auxiliary Module (TLAM) as a channel for feature distillation, which facilitates a bottom-up transmission of global features. Furthermore, we introduce two novel loss functions: the Angle Loss, which account for the angle between predicted and ground truth lanes, and the Generalized Line IoU Loss function that considers the scenarios where significant deviations occur between the prediction of lanes and ground truth in some harsh conditions. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method exhibits remarkable superiority over the current state-of-the-art techniques for lane detection.Our codes are available at:https://github.com/crystal250/GSENet.",
