    "abstract": "Recent works on kernel-based attention such as [8] offer an alternative to classical attention with linear rather than quadratic time complexity, enabling transformer-like models to efficiently process long sequences. However, when implemented naively, these algorithms greatly underperform classical attention in speed and memory usage. In this work, we demonstrate a hardware-aware linear attention algorithm, specially optimized for the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) chip, that is substantially faster than all baselines.",
