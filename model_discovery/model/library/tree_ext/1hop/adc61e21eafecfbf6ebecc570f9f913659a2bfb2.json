    "abstract": "Deep learning--based models have surpassed classical machine learning--based approaches in various text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis, news categorization, question answering, and natural language inference. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of more than 150 deep learning--based models for text classification developed in recent years, and we discuss their technical contributions, similarities, and strengths. We also provide a summary of more than 40 popular datasets widely used for text classification. Finally, we provide a quantitative analysis of the performance of different deep learning models on popular benchmarks, and we discuss future research directions.",
