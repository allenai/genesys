    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the NLP community on the use of pretrained Language Models (LMs) as Knowledge Bases (KBs). Researchers have shown that LMs trained on a sufficiently large (web) corpus will encode a significant amount of knowledge implicitly in its parameters. The resulting LM can be probed for different kinds of knowledge and thus acting as a KB. This has a major advantage over traditional KBs in that this method requires no human supervision. In this paper, we present a set of aspects that we deem a LM should have to fully act as a KB, and review the recent literature with respect to those aspects.",
