    "abstract": "Despite the fact that legal judgement prediction (LPJ) specifically entails the utilization of reasoning capacities, the papers which address the specific problem generally do not directly address the task of logical reasoning-and rather suffer from the lack of such mechanisms within the proposed models. Thus, this paper applies the method of modeling logical relations through a graph network to the task of LPJ, which not only supplements the lack of explanation that current model results suffer from, but also integrate logical understanding to models, stepping beyond the currently existing methods in the discourse",
