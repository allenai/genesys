    "abstract": "Natural Language Inference semantic concepts are central to all aspects of natural language meaning. Portuguese has few NLI-annotated datasets created through automatic translation followed by manual checking. The manual creation of NLI datasets is complex and requires many efforts that are sometimes unavailable. Thus, investments to produce good quality synthetic instances that could be used to train machine learning models for NLI are welcome. This work produced InferBR, an NLI dataset for Portuguese. We relied on a semiautomatic process to generate premises and an automatic process to generate hypotheses. The dataset was manually revised, showing that 97.4% of the sentence pairs had good quality, and nearly 100% of the instances had the correct label assigned. The model trained with InferBR is better at recognizing entailment classes in the other Portuguese datasets than the reverse. Because of its diversity and many unique sentences, InferBR can potentially be further augmented. In addition to the dataset, a key contribution is our proposed generation processes for premises and hypotheses that can easily be adapted to other languages and tasks.",
