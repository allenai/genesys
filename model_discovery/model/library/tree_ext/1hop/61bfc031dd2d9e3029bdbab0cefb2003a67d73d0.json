    "abstract": "With numerous languages nearing extinction, the urgency to preserve endangered languages has become a prominent focus in the linguistic field. This paper delves into the transformative role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the domains of documentation and pedagogy for endangered languages, particularly highlighting its innovative applications and the associated challenges. It delves into how AI-powered tools reshape linguistic fieldwork, offering accelerated annotation, consistent data collection, and deeper analytical endeavors. Furthermore, this exploration highlights the potential of AI in revolutionizing the teaching of these languages, ushering in a new era marked by dynamic, scalable, and engaging learning experiences. While AI presents unparalleled efficiencies, its challenges, ranging from data scarcity to the looming digital divide, are addressed critically. As the digital age continues to evolve, merging AIs capabilities with traditional linguistic approaches holds the promise of a more inclusive and comprehensive strategy to rejuvenate and preserve the worlds rich linguistic tapestry. This paper has summarized and provided an outlook on the research topic at hand.",
