    "abstract": "This paper presents the first Arabic crossword puzzle generator driven by advanced AI technology. Leveraging cutting-edge large language models including GPT4, GPT3-Davinci, GPT3-Curie, GPT3-Babbage, GPT3-Ada, and BERT, the system generates distinctive and challenging clues. Based on a dataset comprising over 50,000 clue-answer pairs, the generator employs fine-tuning, few/zero-shot learning strategies, and rigorous quality-checking protocols to enforce the generation of high-quality clue-answer pairs. Importantly, educational crosswords contribute to enhancing memory, expanding vocabulary, and promoting problem-solving skills, thereby augmenting the learning experience through a fun and engaging approach, reshaping the landscape of traditional learning methods. The overall system can be exploited as a powerful educational tool that amalgamates AI and innovative learning techniques, heralding a transformative era for Arabic crossword puzzles and the intersection of technology and education.",
