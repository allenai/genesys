    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The emergence of AI has revolutionized video production, enabling innovative approaches in artistic creation. With self-media's rise and demand for user-generated content, AI drives personalized, efficient video production. However, research lacks comprehensive reviews of AI's impact on film and TV. This study fills the gap by analyzing AI's influence using a five-sub-field framework. Through literature integration, we assess AI video production's potential, proposing a new process paradigm. This research sheds light on AI's transformative role, guiding efficient, personalized film and TV production, and inspiring deep learning-based advancements. This paper acts as a roadmap for maximizing AI's potential in enhancing production quality and efficiency.",
