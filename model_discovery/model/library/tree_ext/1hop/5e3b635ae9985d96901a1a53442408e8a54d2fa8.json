    "abstract": "Constructing AI models that respond to text instructions is challenging, especially for sequential decision-making tasks. This work introduces an instruction-tuned Video Pretraining (VPT) model for Minecraft\u2122 called S TEVE -1, demonstrating that the unCLIP approach, utilized in DALL\u2022E 2, is also effective for creating instruction-following sequential decision-making agents. S TEVE -1 is trained in two steps: adapting the pretrained VPT model to follow commands in MineCLIP\u2019s latent space, then training a prior to predict latent codes from text. This allows us to finetune VPT through self-supervised behavioral cloning and hindsight relabeling, bypassing the need for costly human text annotations. By leveraging pretrained models like VPT and MineCLIP and employing best practices from text-conditioned image generation, S TEVE -1 costs just $60 to train and can follow a wide range of short-horizon open-ended text and visual instructions in Minecraft . S TEVE -1 sets a new bar for open-ended instruction following in Minecraft with low-level controls (mouse and keyboard) and raw pixel inputs, far outperforming previous baselines. We provide experimental evidence highlighting key factors for downstream performance, including pretraining, classifier-free guidance, and data scaling. All resources, including our model weights, training scripts, and evaluation tools are made available for further research.",
