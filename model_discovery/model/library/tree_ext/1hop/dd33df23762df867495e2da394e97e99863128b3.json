    "abstract": "Multi-Intent spoken language understanding (SLU) can handle complicated utterances expressing multiple intents, which has attracted increasing attention from researchers. Although existing models have achieved promising performance, most of them still suffer from two leading problems: (1) each intent has its specific scope and the semantic information outside the scope might potentially hinder accurate predictions, i.e. scope barrier; (2) only the guidance from intent to slot is modeled but the guidance from slot to intent is often neglected, i.e. unidirectional guidance. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Intent SLU framework termed HAOT, which utilizes hierarchical attention to divide the scopes of each intent and applies optimal transport to achieve the mutual guidance between slot and intent. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public Multi-Intent SLU datasets, obtaining the 3.4 improvement on MixATIS dataset compared to the previous best models in overall accuracy.",
