    "abstract": "We present the Open Compass project\u2019s pilot deep learning benchmark results with various AI accelerators. Those accelerators are NVIDIA V-100 and A-100, AMD MI100, as well as emerging novel accelerators such as Cerebras CS-2 and Graphcore. We evaluate their performance on various deep learning training tasks. We then discuss key insights from our experiments and share experiences about evaluating and integrating those novel AI accelerators with our supercomputing systems.",
