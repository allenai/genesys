    "abstract": "The quadratic complexity of attention in transformer architectures remains a big bottleneck in scaling up large foundation models for long context. In fact, recent theoretical results show the hardness of approximating the output of softmax attention mechanism in sub-quadratic time assuming Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis. In this paper, we show how to break this theoretical barrier by replacing softmax with a polynomial function and polynomial sketching. In particular we show that sketches for Polynomial Kernel from the randomized numerical linear algebra literature can be used to approximate the polynomial attention which leads to a significantly faster attention mechanism without assuming any sparse structure for the attention matrix that has been done in many previous works. In addition, we propose an efficient block-based algorithm that lets us apply the causal mask to the attention matrix without explicitly realizing the n \u00d7 n attention matrix and compute the output of the polynomial attention mechanism in time linear in the context length. The block-based algorithm gives significant speedups over the cumulative sum algorithm used by Performer to apply the causal mask to the attention matrix. These observations help us design PolySketchFormer , a practical linear-time transformer architecture for language modeling with provable guarantees. We validate our design empirically by training language models with long context lengths. We first show that the eval perplexities of our models are comparable to that of models trained with softmax attention. We then show that for large context lengths our training times are significantly faster than FlashAttention.",
