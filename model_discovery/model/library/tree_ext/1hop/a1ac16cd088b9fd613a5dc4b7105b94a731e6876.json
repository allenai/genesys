    "abstract": "To make the Human Computer Interaction more user friendly and persona aligned, detection of user persona is of utmost significance. Towards achieving this objective, we describe a novel approach to select the persona of a user from pre-determine list of personas and utilize it to generate personalized responses. This is achieved in two steps. Firstly, closest matching persona is detected from a set of pre-determined persona for the user. The second step involves the use of a fine-tuned natural language generation (NLG) model to generate persona compliant responses. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed architecture generates better responses than current approaches by using a detected persona. Experimental evaluation on the PersonaChat dataset has demonstrated notable performance in terms of perplexity and F1-score.",
