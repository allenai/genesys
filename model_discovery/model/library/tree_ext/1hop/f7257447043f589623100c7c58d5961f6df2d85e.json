    "abstract": "Training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on long sequences using backpropagation through time (BPTT) remains a fundamental challenge. It has been shown that adding a local unsupervised loss term into the optimization objective makes the training of RNNs on long sequences more effective. While the importance of an unsupervised task can in principle be controlled by a coefficient in the objective function, the gradients with respect to the unsupervised loss term still influence all the hidden state dimensions, which might cause important information about the supervised task to be degraded or erased. Compared to existing semi-supervised sequence learning methods, this thesis focuses upon a traditionally overlooked mechanism \u2013 an architecture with explicitly designed private and shared hidden units designed to mitigate the detrimental influence of the auxiliary unsupervised loss over the main supervised task. We achieve this by dividing the RNN hidden space into a private space for the supervised task or a shared space for both the supervised and unsupervised tasks. We present extensive experiments with the proposed framework on several long sequence modeling benchmark datasets. Results indicate that the proposed framework can yield performance gains in RNN models where long term dependencies are notoriously challenging to deal with.",
