    "abstract": "This paper presents our approach for the SemEval-2024 Task 10: Emotion Discovery and Reasoning its Flip in Conversations. We propose a transformer-based speaker-centric model for the Emotion Flip Reasoning (EFR) task and a masked-memory network along with a speaker participation vector for the Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) task. We propose a Probable Trigger Zone, which is more likely to contain the utterances causing the emotion of a speaker to flip. In EFR, sub-task 3, the proposed approach archives a 5.9 (F1 score) improvement over the provided task baseline. The ablation study results highlight the significance of various design choices in the proposed method.",
