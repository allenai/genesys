    "abstract": "The previous work on controllable text generation is organized using a new schema we provide in this study. Seven components make up the schema, and each one is crucial to the creation process. To accomplish controlled generation for scientific literature, we describe the various modulation strategies utilised to modulate each of the seven components. We also offer a theoretical study and qualitative examination of these methods. This insight makes possible new architectures based on combinations of these components. Future research will compare these methods empirically to learn more about their strengths and utility.",
