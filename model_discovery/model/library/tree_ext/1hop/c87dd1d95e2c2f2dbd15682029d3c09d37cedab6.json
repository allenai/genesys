    "abstract": "Large language models have led to state-of-the-art accuracies across a range of tasks. However,training large language model needs massive computing resource, as more and more open source pre-training models are available, it is worthy to study how to take full advantage of available model. We find a method to save training time and resource cost by changing the small well-trained model to large model. We initialize a larger target model from a smaller source model by copy weight values from source model and padding with zeros or small initialization values on it to make the source and target model have approximate outputs, which is valid due to block matrix multiplication and residual connection in transformer structure. We test the target model on several data sets and find it is still comparable with the source model. When we continue training the target model, the training loss can start from a smaller value.",
