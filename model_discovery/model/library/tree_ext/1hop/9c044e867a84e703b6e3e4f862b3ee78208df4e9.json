    "abstract": "Recent years have seen tremendous progress in natural language processing (NLP), mostly because of the creation of sophisticated language models. This study examines how NLP methods have developed with an emphasis on improving contextual knowledge. This work investigates the function of complex language models in enhancing contextual comprehension in NLP tasks by thoroughly analyzing their designs, training methods, and applications. Through an assessment of different cutting-edge models and their practical uses, this study offers insights into the difficulties encountered, the progress achieved, and the potential for future development in the field of contextual knowledge enhancement in natural language processing.",
