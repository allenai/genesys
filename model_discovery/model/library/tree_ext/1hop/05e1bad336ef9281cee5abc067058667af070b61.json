    "abstract": "Significant advances have been made recently in NLP in the area of reading comprehension which is useful in machine translation, question answering, summarization and other NLP tasks. Most of these models use an RNN which, though successful, have well documented downsides. A model, called the QANet architecture using only CNNs and attention ( and based on the Transformer architecture ) has been proposed that does not suffer from these downsides. This paper implements the QANet architecture and analyses the results of evaluation on the SQuAD 2.0 dataset. In addition, aspects of the transformerXL architecture are added with a goal to further enhance model performance.",
