    "abstract": "In this article, we review neural networks which have neurons with binary operations or networks that use binary transforms such as the Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT). Neural networks with binary neurons or binary layers can be used in edge applications and/or applications requiring energy-efficient decision-making. WHT-based network is as accurate as the regular neural networks in the CIFAR-10 and the Tiny ImageNet image databases.",
