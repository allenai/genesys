    "abstract": "The appearance of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought ad\u00advancements in natural language processing (NLP), making it more available to everyone. This paper examines the application of LLMs in text mining, with a fo\u00adcus on ChatGPT by OpenAI. The author provides a brief overview of LLMs, high\u00adlighting their structure and training techniques, as well as parameter tuning. Uti\u00adlizing ChatGPT as an example of an LLM, this paper identifies the model\u2019s ca\u00adpabilities and constraints in extracting insights from textual data. Based on the author\u2019s findings, they suggest several applications of LLMs for text mining that provide better text comprehension and set the tone for further research.",
