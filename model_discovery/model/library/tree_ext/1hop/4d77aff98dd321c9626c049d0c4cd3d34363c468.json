    "abstract": "Understanding the neural basis of language comprehension in the brain has been a long-standing goal of various scientific research programs. Recent advances in language modelling and in neuroimaging methodology promise potential improvements in both the investigation of language's neurobiology and in the building of better and more human-like language models. This survey traces a line from early research linking Event Related Potentials and complexity measures derived from simple language models to contemporary studies employing Artificial Neural Network models trained on large corpora in combination with neural response recordings from multiple modalities using naturalistic stimuli.",
