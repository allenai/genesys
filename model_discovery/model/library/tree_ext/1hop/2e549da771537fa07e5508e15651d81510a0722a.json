    "abstract": "Narrated ''how-to'' videos have emerged as a promising data source for a wide range of learning problems, from learning visual representations to training robot policies. However, this data is extremely noisy, as the narrations do not always describe the actions demonstrated in the video. To address this problem we introduce the novel task of visual narration detection, which entails determining whether a narration is visually depicted by the actions in the video. We propose What You Say is What You Show (WYS^2), a method that leverages multi-modal cues and pseudo-labeling to learn to detect visual narrations with only weakly labeled data. Our model successfully detects visual narrations in in-the-wild videos, outperforming strong baselines, and we demonstrate its impact for state-of-the-art summarization and temporal alignment of instructional videos.",
