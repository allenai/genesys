    "abstract": "Text summarization is the research area aiming at creating a short and condensed version of the original document, which conveys the main idea of the document in a few words.\n\nThis research topic has started to attract the attention of a large community of researchers, and it is nowadays counted as one of the most promising research areas.\n\nIn general, text summarization algorithms aim at using a plain text document as input and then output a summary.\n\nHowever, in real-world applications, most of the data is not in a plain text format.\n\nInstead, there is much manifold information to be summarized, such as the summary for a web page based on a query in the search engine, extreme long document (e.g. academic paper), dialog history and so on.\n\nIn this paper, we focus on the survey of these new summarization tasks and approaches in the real-world application.",
