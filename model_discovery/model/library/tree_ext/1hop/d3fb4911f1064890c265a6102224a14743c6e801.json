    "abstract": ". Many well-known matrices Z are associated to fast transforms corresponding to factorizations of the form Z = X ( J ) . . . X (1) , where each factor X ( (cid:96) ) is sparse and possibly structured. This paper investigates essential uniqueness of such factorizations. Our \ufb01rst main contribution is to prove that any N \u00d7 N matrix having the so-called butter\ufb02y structure admits a unique factorization into J butter\ufb02y factors (where N = 2 J ), and that the factors can be recovered by a hierarchical factorization method. This contrasts with existing approaches which \ufb01t the product of the butter\ufb02y factors to a given matrix via gradient descent. The proposed method can be applied in particular to retrieve the factorizations of the Hadamard or the Discrete Fourier Transform matrices of size 2 J . Computing such factorizations costs O ( N 2 ), which is of the order of dense matrix-vector multiplication, while the obtained factorizations enable fast O ( N log N ) matrix-vector multiplications. This hierarchical identi\ufb01ability property relies on a simple identi\ufb01ability condition in the two-layer and \ufb01xed-support setting that was recently established. While the butter\ufb02y structure corresponds to a \ufb01xed prescribed support for each factor, our second contribution is to obtain identi\ufb01ability results with more general families of allowed sparsity patterns, taking into account permutation ambiguities when they are unavoidable. Typically, we show through the hierarchical paradigm that the butter\ufb02y factorization of the Discrete Fourier Transform matrix of size 2 J admits a unique sparse factorization into J factors, when enforcing only 2-sparsity by column and a block-diagonal structure on each factor.",
