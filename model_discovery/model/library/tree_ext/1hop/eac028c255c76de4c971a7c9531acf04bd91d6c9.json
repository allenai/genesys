    "abstract": "Anaphoric expressions, such as pronouns and referential descriptions, are situated with respect to the linguistic context of prior turns, as well as, the immediate visual environment. However, a speaker's referential descriptions do not always uniquely identify the referent, leading to ambiguities in need of resolution through subsequent clarificational exchanges. Thus, effective Ambiguity Detection and Coreference Resolution are key to task success in Conversational AI. In this paper, we present models for these two tasks as part of the SIMMC 2.0 Challenge (Kottur et al. 2021). Specifically, we use TOD-BERT and LXMERT based models, compare them to a number of baselines and provide ablation experiments. Our results show that (1) language models are able to exploit correlations in the data to detect ambiguity; and (2) unimodal coreference resolution models can avoid the need for a vision component, through the use of smart object representations.",
