    "abstract": "Argument mining is an emerging area of research. Argument mining in financial domain specifically for low-resources language like Bengali is in its nascent stage. There exist no datasets for argumentative financial texts mining in Bengali. In this paper, we propose two new datasets in Bengali for financial argument analysis. Subsequently, we released two transformer-based models fine-tuned on these datasets as baselines for financial argumentative unit classification and for detecting the relation between two argumentative financial texts.",
