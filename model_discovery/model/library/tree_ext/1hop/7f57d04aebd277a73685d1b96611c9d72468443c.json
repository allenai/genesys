    "abstract": "This report presents a novel Mamba-based encoder-decoder architecture, QueryMamba, featuring an integrated verb-noun interaction module that utilizes a statistical verb-noun co-occurrence matrix to enhance video action forecasting. This architecture not only predicts verbs and nouns likely to occur based on historical data but also considers their joint occurrence to improve forecast accuracy. The efficacy of this approach is substantiated by experimental results, with the method achieving second place in the Ego4D LTA challenge and ranking first in noun prediction accuracy.",
