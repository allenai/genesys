    "abstract": "This paper introduces a method that efficiently reduces the computational cost and parameter size of Transformer. The proposed model, refer to as Group-Transformer, splits feature space into multiple groups, factorizes the calculation paths, and reduces computations for the group interaction. Extensive experiments on two benchmark tasks, enwik8 and text8, prove our model\u2019s effectiveness and efficiency in small-scale Transformers. To the best of our knowledge, Group-Transformer is the first attempt to design Transformer with the group strategy, widely used for efficient CNN architectures.",
