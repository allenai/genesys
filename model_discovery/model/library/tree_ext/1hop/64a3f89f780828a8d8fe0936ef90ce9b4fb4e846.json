    "abstract": "arxiv-year dataset there shows clear discrepancy between the two, where the global module brings a salient 3% boost. The results provide a strong validatioin towards our main intuition, that the global module increases expressive power by modeling long-range interactions. And such ability is especially effective towards heterophilious graphs, which is intuitive as many other successful heterophilious GNN architectures aimed at broadening the range of message passing as well as learning from long-range interactions",
