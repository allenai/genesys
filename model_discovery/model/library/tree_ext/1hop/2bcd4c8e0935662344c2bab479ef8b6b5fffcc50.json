    "abstract": "Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques have drawn significant attention due to their ability to yield competitive results while updating only a small portion of the adjustable parameters. However, existing PEFT methods pose challenges in hyperparameter selection, such as choosing the rank for LoRA or Adapter, or specifying the length of soft prompts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach for neural models, named Representation EDiting (RED), which modifies the representations generated at some layers through the application of scaling and biasing operations. While existing PEFT methods still demonstrate over-parameterization that could potentially undermine the generalization ability acquired from pre-training, RED can substantially reduce the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 25, 700 compared to full parameter fine-tuning and by a factor of 32 relative to LoRA. Remarkably, RED achieves results comparable or superior to both full parameter fine-tuning and other PEFT methods. Extensive experiments across various model architectures and scales, including RoBERTa, GPT-2, T5, and LLaMA-2, have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of RED1, thereby positioning it as a promising PEFT strategy for large-scale neural models.",
