    "abstract": "In this paper, novel research is presented that constructs a PDF chatbot using ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo and the LLM Model. The framework, chatGPT 3.5, streamlines chatbot creation, enabling scalable AI/LLM applications. The potent LLM Model facilitates text generation, language translation, and original content creation, along with insightful responses to user queries. The approach combines chatGPT 3.5 Turbo and the LLM Model to develop a chatbot proficient in addressing PDF-related inquiries. Utilizing data from uploaded PDFs and the LLM Model, the chatbot generates informative text responses to customer questions. The research relies on the LangChain framework, while a Streamlit based homepage enhances user interactions. This work exemplifies the LangChain and LLM Model\u2019s potential to craft engaging chatbots, adaptable across domains like customer service, education, and research. The chat bot, a valuable resource for addressing product queries, offering educational aid, and providing tutoring, effectively responds to user inquiries about PDF files.",
