    "abstract": "State-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers have shown remarkable Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) performance when trained and evaluated on current benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily consist of clear scenarios, overlooking adverse atmospheric conditions such as fog, haze, smoke and dust. As a result, the robustness of SOTA trackers remains underexplored. To address these limitations, we propose a pipeline for physic-based volumetric fog simulation in arbitrary real-world MOT dataset utilizing frame-by-frame monocular depth estimation and a fog formation optical model. Moreover, we enhance our simulation by rendering of both homogeneous and heterogeneous fog effects. We propose to use the dark channel prior method to estimate fog (smoke) color, which shows promising results even in night and indoor scenes. We present the leading tracking benchmark MOTChallenge (MOT17 dataset) overlaid by fog (smoke for indoor scenes) of various intensity levels and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of SOTA MOT methods, revealing their limitations under fog and fog-similar challenges.",
