    "abstract": "Public opinion on international conflicts, such as the concurrent Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestine crises, often reflects a society's values, beliefs, and history. These simultaneous conflicts have sparked heated global online discussions, offering a unique opportunity to explore the dynamics of public opinion in multiple international crises. This study investigates how public opinions toward one conflict might influence or relate to another, a relatively unexplored area in contemporary research. Focusing on Chinese netizens, who represent a significant online population, this study examines their perspectives, which are increasingly influential in global discourse due to China's unique cultural and political landscape. The research finds a range of opinions, including neutral stances towards both conflicts and a statistical correlation between attitudes towards each, indicating interconnected or mutually influenced viewpoints. The study also highlights the significant role of news media, particularly in China, where state policies and global politics shape conflict portrayal, in impacting public opinion.",
