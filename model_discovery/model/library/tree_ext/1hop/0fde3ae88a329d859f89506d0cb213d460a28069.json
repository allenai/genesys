    "abstract": "We describe an unbounded capacity Associative Memory which effectively stores and retrieves unrestricted real-valued data/patterns with fidelity. This Associative Memory arises from a gradient system of a (differentiable scalar) energy function, and thus can directly be incorporated within existing layers of computational Deep Learning (DL) frameworks. The design effort also describes two options for key pattern retrieval.",
