    "abstract": "Lattices are compact representations that encode multiple hypotheses, such as speech recognition results or different word segmentations. It is shown that encoding lattices as opposed to 1-best results generated by automatic speech recognizer (ASR) boosts the performance of spoken language understanding (SLU). Recently, pre-trained language models with the transformer architecture have achieved the state-of-the-art results on natural language understanding, but their ability of encoding lattices has not been explored. Therefore, this paper aims at adapting pre-trained transformers to lattice inputs in order to perform understanding tasks specifically for spoken language. Our experiments on the benchmark ATIS dataset show that fine-tuning pre-trained transformers with lattice inputs yields clear improvement over fine-tuning with 1-best results. Further evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods under different acoustic conditions11The code is available at https://github.com/MiuLab/Lattice-SLU.",
