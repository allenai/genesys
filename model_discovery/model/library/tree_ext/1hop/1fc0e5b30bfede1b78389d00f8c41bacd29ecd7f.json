    "abstract": "The use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in engineering education can provide valuable insights into the underlying processes involved in generating text. While accessing these insights can be labor-intensive if done manually, recent advances in NLP and large language models have made it a realistic option for individuals. This study explores and evaluates a combination of clustering, summarization, and prompting techniques to analyze over 1,000 student essays in which students discussed their career interests. The specific assignment prompted students to define and explain their career goals as engineers. Using text embedding representations of student responses, we clustered the responses together to identify thematically similar statements from students. The clustered responses were then summarized to quickly identify career interest themes. We also used a set of a priori codes about career satisfaction and sectors to demonstrate an alternative approach to using these generative text models to analyze student writing. The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of NLP techniques in engineering education research. By automating the initial analysis of student essays, researchers and educators can more efficiently and accurately identify key themes and patterns in student writing. The methods presented in this paper have broader applications for engineering education and research purposes beyond analyzing student essays. By explaining these methods to the engineering education community, readers can utilize them in their own contexts.",
