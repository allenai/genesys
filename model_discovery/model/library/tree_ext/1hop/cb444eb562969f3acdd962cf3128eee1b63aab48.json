    "abstract": "This study is divided into two crucial sections. We first gathered Bangla song names and lyrics using web crawling and a dataset that was only slightly annotated. A comprehensive dataset was then thoroughly annotated across five different genres. Utilizing transformer models to classify the genre of Bangla songs was our main goal. Noteworthy accomplishments are the 94% accuracy and F1-score of csebuetnlp/banglabert. Additionally, we created a text generation system using ritog/bangla-gpt2 and flax-community/gpt2-bengali. This method allows for the development of scenario-based music material, expanding the creative possibilities for the entertainment business, by choosing the genre with the highest F1 score from the classification findings.",
