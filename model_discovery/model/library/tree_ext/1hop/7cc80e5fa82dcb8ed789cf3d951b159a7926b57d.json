    "abstract": "In various scenarios, such as conference oral presentations, company managers\u2019 talks, and politicians\u2019 speeches, individuals often contemplate the potential questions that may arise from their presentations. This common practice prompts the research question addressed in this study: to what extent can models generate multiple questions based on a given presentation transcript? To investigate this, we conduct pilot explorations using earnings conference call transcripts, which serve as regular meetings between professional investors and company managers. We experiment with different task settings and methods and evaluate the results from various perspectives. Our findings highlight that incorporating key points retrieval techniques enhances the accuracy and diversity of the generated questions.",
