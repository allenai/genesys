    "abstract": "Recent advances in powerful pre-trained diffusion models encourage the development of methods to improve the sampling performance under well-trained diffusion models. This paper introduces Diffusion Rejection Sampling (DiffRS), which uses a rejection sampling scheme that aligns the sampling transition kernels with the true ones at each timestep. The proposed method can be viewed as a mechanism that evaluates the quality of samples at each intermediate timestep and refines them with varying effort depending on the sample. Theoretical analysis shows that DiffRS can achieve a tighter bound on sampling error compared to pre-trained models. Empirical results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of DiffRS on the benchmark datasets and the effectiveness of DiffRS for fast diffusion samplers and large-scale text-to-image diffusion models.
