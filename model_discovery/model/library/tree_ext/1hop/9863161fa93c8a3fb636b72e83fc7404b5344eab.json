    "abstract": "Advanced deep learning-based Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) techniques are designed to restore high-frequency image details and enhance imaging resolution through the use of rapid and lightweight network architectures. Existing SISR methodologies face the challenge of striking a balance between performance and computational costs, which hinders the practical application of SISR methods. In response to this challenge, the present study introduces a lightweight network known as the Spatial and Channel Aggregation Network (SCAN), designed to excel in image super-resolution (SR) tasks. SCAN is the first SISR method to employ large-kernel convolutions combined with feature reduction operations. This design enables the network to focus more on challenging intermediate-level information extraction, leading to improved performance and efficiency of the network. Additionally, an innovative 9 \u00d7 9 large kernel convolution was introduced to further expand the receptive field. The proposed SCAN method outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight SISR methods on benchmark datasets with a 0.13 dB improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and a 0.0013 increase in structural similarity (SSIM). Moreover, on remote sensing datasets, SCAN achieves a 0.4 dB improvement in PSNR and a 0.0033 increase in SSIM.",
