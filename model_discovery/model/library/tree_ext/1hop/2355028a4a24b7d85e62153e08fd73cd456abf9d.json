    "abstract": "Looking at how social values are represented in fairy tales can give insights\nabout the variations in communication of values across cultures. We study how\nvalues are communicated in fairy tales from Portugal, Italy and Germany using a\ntechnique called word embedding with a compass to quantify vocabulary\ndifferences and commonalities. We study how these three national traditions\ndiffer in their explicit references to values. To do this, we specify a list of\nvalue-charged tokens, consider their word stems and analyse the distance\nbetween these in a bespoke pre-trained Word2Vec model. We triangulate and\ncritically discuss the validity of the resulting hypotheses emerging from this\nquantitative model. Our claim is that this is a reusable and reproducible\nmethod for the study of the values explicitly referenced in historical corpora.\nFinally, our preliminary findings hint at a shared cultural understanding and\nthe expression of values such as Benevolence, Conformity, and Universalism\nacross the studied cultures, suggesting the potential existence of a\npan-European cultural memory.",
