    "abstract": "Transformers have demonstrated impressive results for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation. However, the quadratic complexity of transformer makes computation cost high, limiting the number of points that can be processed simultaneously and impeding the modeling of long-range dependencies. Drawing inspiration from the great potential of recent state space models (SSM) for long sequence modeling, we introduce Mamba, a SSM-based architecture, to the point cloud domain and propose Mamba24/8D, which has strong global modeling capability under linear complexity. Specifically, to make disorderness of point clouds fit in with the causal nature of Mamba, we propose a multi-path serialization strategy applicable to point clouds. Besides, we propose the ConvMamba block to compensate for the shortcomings of Mamba in modeling local geometries and in unidirectional modeling. Mamba24/8D obtains state of the art results on several 3D point cloud segmentation tasks, including ScanNet v2, ScanNet200 and nuScenes, while its effectiveness is validated by extensive experiments.",
