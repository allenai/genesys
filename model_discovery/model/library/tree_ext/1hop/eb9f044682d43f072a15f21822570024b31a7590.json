    "abstract": "Transformers have revolutionized various domains of artificial intelligence due to their unique ability to model long-range dependencies in data. However, they lack in nuanced, context-dependent modulation of features and information flow. This paper introduces two significant enhancements to the transformer architecture - the Evaluator Adjuster Unit (EAU) and Gated Residual Connections (GRC) - designed to address these limitations. The EAU dynamically modulates attention outputs based on the relevance of the input context, allowing for more adaptive response patterns. Concurrently, the GRC modifies the transformer's residual connections through a gating mechanism that selectively controls the information flow, thereby enhancing the network's ability to focus on contextually important features. We evaluate the performance of these enhancements across several benchmarks in natural language processing. Our results demonstrate improved adaptability and efficiency, suggesting that these modifications could set new standards for designing flexible and context-aware transformer models.",
