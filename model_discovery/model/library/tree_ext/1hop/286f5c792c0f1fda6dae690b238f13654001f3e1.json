    "abstract": "We present a novel approach to generating 001 scripts by using agents with different person- 002 ality types. To manage character interaction in 003 the script, we employ simulated dramatic net- 004 works. Automatic and human evaluation on 005 multiple criteria shows that our approach out- 006 performs a vanilla- GPT2 -based baseline. We 007 further introduce a new metric to evaluate di- 008 alogue consistency based on natural language 009 inference and demonstrate its validity. 010",
