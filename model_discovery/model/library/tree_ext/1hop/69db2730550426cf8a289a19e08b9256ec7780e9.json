    "abstract": "Automatic identification of snake species from non-standard photos is an important task to improve medical treatment of snakebites. To address this problem, the SnakeCLEF 2023 competition provides a large data set of photos and metadata information for 1,784 snake species. This paper describes the FHDO Biomedical Computer Science Group\u2019s (BCSG) participation in this competition. Through a series of experiments investigating the effects of pre-trained feature extractors, image sizes, metadata integrations, class balance learning and multiple instance pooling methods, a proposed model architecture for joint feature learning of image data and embedded metadata is presented to improve classification of snake species. With this proposal, the best model achieved a macro \ud835\udc39 1 -Score of 81 . 90 % and challenge-specific metrics of 90 . 09 % Track 1 and 1 , 149 Track 2 on the challenge public test data set.",
