    "abstract": "This article explores deep learning models for the automatic identification of registers - text varieties such as news reports and discussion forums - in web-based datasets across 16 languages. Identifying web registers, or genres, is crucial for understanding the content of web-scale datasets, which have become essential in corpus and computational linguistics. Despite recent advances, the full potential of register classifiers in the noisy, unrestricted web remains largely unexplored, particularly in multilingual settings. We experiment with various deep learning models using the Multilingual CORE corpora, newly introduced in this article, which includes 16 languages annotated with a detailed, hierarchical taxonomy of 25 registers designed to cover the entire web. Our classifiers achieve state-of-the-art results using a multi-label approach, demonstrating that competitive performance is possible using a relatively complex register taxonomy. However, all models hit a performance ceiling at approximately 80% F1 score, which we attribute to the non-discrete nature of web registers and the inherent uncertainty in labeling some documents. By pruning ambiguous examples, we enhance model performance to over 90%. Additionally, multilingual models consistently outperform monolingual ones, especially benefiting languages with fewer training examples and smaller registers. Although a zero-shot setting reduces performance by an average of 7%, these drops are not correlated with specific registers or languages. Instead, we find that registers are surprisingly similar across languages.",
