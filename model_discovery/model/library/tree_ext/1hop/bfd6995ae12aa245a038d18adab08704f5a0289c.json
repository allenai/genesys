    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are posited as a biologically plausible alternative to conventional neural architectures, with their core computational framework resting on the extensively studied leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron design. The stateful nature of LIF neurons has spurred ongoing discussions about the ability of SNNs to process sequential data, akin to recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Despite this, there remains a significant gap in the exploration of current SNNs within the realm of long-range dependency tasks. In this study, to extend the analysis of neuronal dynamics beyond simplistic LIF mechanism, we present a novel class of stochastic spiking neuronal model grounded in state space models. We expand beyond the scalar hidden state representation of LIF neurons, which traditionally comprises only the membrane potential, by proposing an n-dimensional hidden state. Additionally, we enable fine-tuned formulation of neuronal dynamics across each layer by introducing learnable parameters, as opposed to the fixed dynamics in LIF neurons. We also develop a robust framework for scaling these neuronal models to deep SNN-based architectures, ensuring efficient parallel training while also adeptly addressing the challenge of non-differentiability of stochastic spiking operation during the backward phase. Our models attain state-of-the-art performance among SNN models across diverse long-range dependency tasks, encompassing the Long Range Arena benchmark, permuted sequential MNIST, and the Speech Command dataset. Moreover, we provide an analysis of the energy efficiency advantages, emphasizing the sparse activity pattern intrinsic to this spiking model.",
