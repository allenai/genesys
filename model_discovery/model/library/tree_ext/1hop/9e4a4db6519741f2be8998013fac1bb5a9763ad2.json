    "abstract": "Generally, a continuing care retirement community (CCRC) can benefit older adults by allowing them to move among and through independent living, assisted living, skilled nursing care, and Alzheimer\u2019s care, and so on. In this paper, we propose a visit prediction method to predict next visit of the patients in the CCRC from their visit sequences of a certain in-patient room in the CCRC. There are three contributions of our proposed method. Firstly, we use a complex-valued continuous function to represent the ordered relationship in visit sequences, which replaces the representations of absolute positions in the original Transformer. Secondly, we multiply the length of query vector and the length of key vector with the scaling factor of the original Transformer to make the training process more stable. Thirdly, we evaluate the period of visit session interval based on its mean value and variance by using the maximum likelihood estimation.",
