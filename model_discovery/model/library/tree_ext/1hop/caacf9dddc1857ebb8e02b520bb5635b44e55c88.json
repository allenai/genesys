    "abstract": "Systems engineering, in particular in the automotive domain, needs to cope with the massively increasing numbers of requirements that arise during the development process. The language in which requirements are written is mostly informal and highly individual. This hinders automated processing of requirements as well as the linking of requirements to models. Introducing formal requirement notations in existing projects leads to the challenge of translating masses of requirements and the necessity of training for requirements engineers. In this paper, we derive domain-specific language constructs helping us to avoid ambiguities in requirements and increase the level of formality. The main contribution is the adoption and evaluation of few-shot learning with large pretrained language models for the automated translation of informal requirements to structured languages such as a requirement DSL.",
