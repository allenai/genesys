    "abstract": "Our final project aims to implement a question answering system that works well on SQuAD 2.0 by capturing long-term dependency. We implemented a Transformer-based model on QA task, QANet to improve the performance compared to the baseline model, BiDAF. In addition, we add character embedding and applied the Transformer-XL to the original QANet to model long-term dependency. We modified the starter code and trained our QANet according to the original paper, and yielded better results than the baseline",
