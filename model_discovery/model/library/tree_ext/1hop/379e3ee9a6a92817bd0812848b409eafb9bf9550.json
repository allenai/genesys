    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized solutions for general natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, deploying these models in specific domains still faces challenges like hallucination. While existing knowledge graph retrieval-based approaches offer partial solutions, they cannot be well adapted to the political domain. On one hand, existing generic knowledge graphs lack vital political context, hindering deductions for practical tasks. On the other hand, the nature of political questions often renders the direct facts elusive, necessitating deeper aggregation and comprehension of retrieved evidence. To address these challenges, we propose a Political Experts through Knowledge Graph Integration (PEG) framework. PEG entails the creation and utilization of a multi-view political knowledge graph (MVPKG), which integrates U.S. legislative, election, and diplomatic data, as well as conceptual knowledge from Wikidata. With MVPKG as its foundation, PEG enhances existing methods through knowledge acquisition, aggregation, and injection. This process begins with refining evidence through semantic filtering, followed by its aggregation into global knowledge via implicit or explicit methods. The integrated knowledge is then utilized by LLMs through prompts. Experiments on three real-world datasets across diverse LLMs confirm PEG's superiority in tackling political modeling tasks.",
