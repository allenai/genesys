    "abstract": "Deep learning has brought about a revolutionary transformation in network applications, particularly in domains like e-commerce and online advertising. Distributed training (DT), as a critical means to expedite model training, has progressively emerged as a key foundational infrastructure for such applications. However, with the rapid advancement of hardware accelerators, the performance bottleneck in DT has shifted from computation to communication. In-network aggregation (INA) solutions have shown promise in alleviating the communication bottleneck. Regrettably, current INA solutions primarily focus on improving efficiency under the traditional parameter server (PS) architecture and do not fully address the communication bottleneck caused by limited PS ingress bandwidth. To bridge this gap, we propose InArt, the first work to introduce INA with routing selection in a multi-PS architecture. InArt employs a multi-PS architecture to split DT tasks among multiple PSs, and selects appropriate routing schemes to fully harness INA capabilities. To accommodate traffic dynamics, InArt adopts a two-phase approach: splitting the training model among multiple parameter servers and selecting routing paths for INA. We propose Lagrange multiplier and randomized rounding algorithms for these phases, respectively. We implement InArt and evaluate its performance through experiments on physical platforms (Tofino switches) and Mininet emulation (P4 Software Switches). Experimental results show that InArt can reduce communication time by 48%\\!\\sim57\\!% compared with state-of-the-art solutions.",
