    "abstract": "Modeling and predicting grid frequency is an important task in power system control. While the consideration of external techno-economic features could improve the modeling of the short-term dynamics of grid frequency, such features are often only recorded on an hourly basis and require careful treatment. We present a purely data-driven approach to modeling grid frequency as an alternative to prediction models incorporating physical characteristics of power systems. Using sequence models such as gated recurrent units and transformers, we extract the necessary information and relationships from the static frequency vector to predict the process parameters for the short-term dynamics of frequency following a Gaussian process. Both for the evaluation measures (e.g. MSE, MAE, RMSE) for point estimators and for the measures for probalistic evaluations (e.g. Negative Log Likelihood Score, CPRS and Energy Score), our prediction performance is comparable to state-of-the-art models and outperforms various purely data-driven models such as daily profiles and k-nearest-neighbour profiles. Moreover, synthetic time series generated by our models can successfully reproduce the main statistical characteristics of the grid frequency.",
