    "abstract": "There is an increasing interest in the application of deep learning architectures to tabular data. One of the state-of-the-art solutions is TabTransformer which incorporates an attention mechanism to better track relationships between categorical features and then makes use of a standard MLP to output its final logits. In this paper we propose multiple modifications to the original TabTransformer performing better on binary classification tasks for three separate datasets with more than 1% AUROC gains. Inspired by gated MLP, linear projections are implemented in the MLP block and multiple activation functions are tested. We also evaluate the importance of specific hyper parameters during training.",
