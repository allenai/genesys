    "abstract": "Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, when fine-tuned on a few personal images, are able to generate visuals with a high degree of consistency. However, they still lack in synthesizing images of different scenarios or styles that are possible in the original pretrained models. To address this, we propose to fine-tune the T2I model by maximizing consistency to reference images, while penalizing the deviation from the pretrained model. We devise a novel training objective for T2I diffusion models that minimally fine-tunes the pretrained model to achieve consistency. Our method, dubbed \\emph{Direct Consistency Optimization}, is as simple as regular diffusion loss, while significantly enhancing the compositionality of personalized T2I models. Also, our approach induces a new sampling method that controls the tradeoff between image fidelity and prompt fidelity. Lastly, we emphasize the necessity of using a comprehensive caption for reference images to further enhance the image-text alignment. We show the efficacy of the proposed method on the T2I personalization for subject, style, or both. In particular, our method results in a superior Pareto frontier to the baselines.
