    "abstract": "Cross-view matching of image local features is a fundamental task for visual localization and 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we propose FilterGNN, a Transformer-based graph neural network (GNN), aiming to improve matching ef\ufb01ciency and accuracy for visual descriptors. Based on high matching sparseness and coarse-to-\ufb01ne co-visible area detection, Fil-terGNN utilizes cascaded optimal graph matching \ufb01lter modules to dynamically reject outlier matches. More-over, we have successfully adapted linear attention for FilterGNN with post instance normalization support, which signi\ufb01cantly reduces the complexity of complete graph learning from O ( N 2 ) to O ( N ) . Experiments show that FilterGNN only takes 6% time cost and 33 . 3% memory cost against SuperGlue under large-scale input size, and achieves competitive performance for various tasks, such as pose estimation, visual localization and sparse 3D reconstruction.",
