    "abstract": "Entity recognition of product titles is essential for retrieving and recommending product information. Due to the irregularity of product title text, such as informal sentence structure, a large number of professional attribute words, a large number of unrelated independent entities of various combinations, the existing general named entity recognition model is limited in the e\u2010commerce field of product title entity recognition. Most of the current studies focus on only one of the two challenges instead of considering the two challenges together. Our approach proposes NEZHA\u2010CNN\u2010GlobalPointer architecture with the addition of label semantic network, and uses multigranularity contextual and label semantic information to fully capture the internal structure and category information of words and texts to improve the entity recognition accuracy. Through a series of experiments, we proved the efficiency of our approach over a dataset of Chinese product titles from JD.com, improving the F1\u2010value by 5.98%, when compared to the BERT\u2010LSTM\u2010CRF model on the product title corpus.",
