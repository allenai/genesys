    "abstract": "The accurate instance segmentation of individual crop plants is crucial for achieving a high-throughput phenotypic analysis of seedlings and smart field management in agriculture. Current crop monitoring techniques employing remote sensing predominantly focus on population analysis, thereby lacking precise estimations for individual plants. This study concentrates on maize, a critical staple crop, and leverages multispectral remote sensing data sourced from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A large-scale SAM image segmentation model is employed to efficiently annotate maize plant instances, thereby constructing a dataset for maize seedling instance segmentation. The study evaluates the experimental accuracy of six instance segmentation algorithms: Mask R-CNN, Cascade Mask R-CNN, PointRend, YOLOv5, Mask Scoring R-CNN, and YOLOv8, employing various combinations of multispectral bands for a comparative analysis. The experimental findings indicate that the YOLOv8 model exhibits exceptional segmentation accuracy, notably in the NRG band, with bbox_mAP50 and segm_mAP50 accuracies reaching 95.2% and 94%, respectively, surpassing other models. Furthermore, YOLOv8 demonstrates robust performance in generalization experiments, indicating its adaptability across diverse environments and conditions. Additionally, this study simulates and analyzes the impact of different resolutions on the model\u2019s segmentation accuracy. The findings reveal that the YOLOv8 model sustains high segmentation accuracy even at reduced resolutions (1.333 cm/px), meeting the phenotypic analysis and field management criteria.",
