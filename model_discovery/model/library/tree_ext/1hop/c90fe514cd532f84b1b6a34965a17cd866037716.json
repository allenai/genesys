    "abstract": "This paper proposes layer fusion - a model compression technique that discovers which weights to combine and then fuses weights of similar fully-connected, convolutional and attention layers. Layer fusion can signi\ufb01cantly reduce the number of layers of the original network with little additional computation overhead, while maintaining competitive performance. From experiments on CIFAR-10, we \ufb01nd that various deep convolution neural networks can remain within 2% accuracy points of the original networks up to a compression ratio of 3.33 when iteratively retrained with layer fusion. For experiments on the WikiText-2 language modelling dataset, we compress Transformer models to 20% of their original size while being within 5 perplexity points of the original network. We also \ufb01nd that other well-established compression techniques can achieve competitive performance when compared to their original networks given a suf\ufb01cient number of retraining steps. Generally, we observe a clear in\ufb02ection point in performance as the amount of compression increases, suggesting a bound on the amount of compression that can be achieved before an exponential degradation in performance.",
