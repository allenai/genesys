    "abstract": ": The Taboo Challenge competition, a task based on the well-known Taboo game, has been proposed to stimulate research in the AI \ufb01eld. The challenge requires building systems able to comprehend the implied inferences between the exchanged messages of guesser and describer agents. A describer sends pre-determined hints to guessers indirectly describing cities, and guessers are required to return the matching cities implied by the hints. Climbing up the scoring ledger requires the resolving of the highest amount of cities with the smallest amount of hints in a speci\ufb01ed time frame. Here, we present TabooLM, a language-model approach that tackles the challenge based on a zero-shot setting. We start by presenting and comparing the results of this approach with three studies from the literature. The results show that our method achieves SOTA results on the Taboo challenge, suggesting that TabooLM can guess the implied cities faster and more accurately than existing approaches.",
