    "abstract": "Transferring DGD models from high-resource languages to low-resource languages is a meaningful but challenging task. Being able to provide multilingual responses to multilingual documents further complicates the task. This paper describes our method at DialDoc23 Shared Task (Document-Grounded Dialogue and Conversational Question Answering) for generate responses based on the most relevant passage retrieved. We divide it into three steps of retrieval, re-ranking and generation. Our methods include negative sample augmentation, prompt learning, pseudo-labeling and ensemble. On the submission page, we rank 2nd based on the sum of token-level F1, SacreBleu and Rouge-L scores used for the final evaluation, and get the total score of 210.25.",
