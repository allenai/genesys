    "abstract": ". The Question Answering task, whereby a system receives a plain language question from a user and returns a concise answer from a corpus of documents, has received considerable attention from academia and the commercial world since mid-way through the 20 th century. This paper o\ufb00ers a concise overview of this literature, focussing on recent advancements of the state-of-the-art achieved by neural network-based approaches. The rate of change of these advancements is considerable and has left a sparse landscape of analysis and research still to be conducted. My main contribution in this paper is to shine a light on these gaps in the literature, o\ufb00ering inspiration for future research.",
