    "abstract": "Automatic lexical simplification is a task to substitute lexical items that may be unfamiliar and difficult to understand with easier and more common words. This paper presents MultiLS-SP/CA, a novel dataset for lexical simplification in Spanish and Catalan. This dataset represents the first of its kind in Catalan and a substantial addition to the sparse data on automatic lexical simplification which is available for Spanish. Specifically, MultiLS-SP is the first dataset for Spanish which includes scalar ratings of the understanding difficulty of lexical items. In addition, we describe experiments with this dataset, which can serve as a baseline for future work on the same data.",
