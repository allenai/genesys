    "abstract": "Our approach to detecting machine-generated text for the SemEval-2024 Task 8 combines a wide range of linguistic-stylistic features with pre-trained language models (PLM). Experiments using random forests and PLMs resulted in an augmented DistilBERT system for subtask A and B and an augmented Longformer for subtask C. These systems achieved accuracies of 0.63 and 0.77 for the mono- and multilingual tracks of subtask A, 0.64 for subtask B and a MAE of 26.07 for subtask C. Although lower than the task organizer\u2019s baselines, we demonstrate that linguistic-stylistic features are predictors for whether a text was authored by a model (and if so, which one).",
