    "abstract": "Several recently developed neural network models have shown their potential for automated text summarization. However, the evaluation results of these models on summarization of long text are fairly close in almost every major evaluation parameter. None of these models including large language models GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can well summarize long text without manual interventions. In this paper, we report the evaluation results of several state-of-the-art neural network models on text summarization under different configurations of the input, which includes 1630 U.S. patent documents. Based on the evaluation results, we proposed a strategy for improving the text summarization in long text and demonstrated its effectiveness with new cases.",
