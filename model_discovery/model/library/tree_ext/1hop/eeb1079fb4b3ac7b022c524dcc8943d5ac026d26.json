    "abstract": "In Natural Language Processing, multi-document summarization (MDS) poses many challenges to researchers above those posed by single-document summarization (SDS). These challenges include the increased search space and greater potential for the inclusion of redundant information. While advancements in deep learning approaches have led to the development of several advanced language models capable of summarization, the variety of training data specific to the problem of MDS remains relatively limited. Therefore, MDS approaches which require little to no pretraining, known as few-shot or zero-shot applications, respectively, could be beneficial additions to the current set of tools available in summarization. To explore one possible approach, we devise a strategy for combining state-of-the-art models' outputs using maximal marginal relevance (MMR) with a focus on query relevance rather than document diversity. Our MMR-based approach shows improvement over some aspects of the current state-of-the-art results in both few-shot and zero-shot MDS applications while maintaining a state-of-the-art standard of output by all available metrics.",
