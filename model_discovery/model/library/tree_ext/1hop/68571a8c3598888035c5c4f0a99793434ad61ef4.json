    "abstract": "Text Summarization is a popular task and an active area of research for the Natural Language Processing community. By definition, it requires to account for long input texts, a characteristic which poses computational challenges for neural models. Moreover, real-world documents come in a variety of complex, visually-rich, layouts. This information is of great relevance, whether to highlight salient content or to encode long-range interactions between textual passages. Yet, all publicly available summarization datasets only provide plain text content. To facilitate research on how to exploit visual/layout information to better capture long-range dependencies in summarization models, we present LoRaLay, a collection of datasets for long-range summarization with accompanying visual/layout information. We extend existing and popular English datasets (arXiv and PubMed) with layout information and propose four novel datasets \u2013 consistently built from scholar resources \u2013 covering French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Korean languages. Further, we propose new baselines merging layout-aware and long-range models \u2013 two orthogonal approaches \u2013 and obtain state-of-the-art results, showing the importance of combining both lines of research.",
