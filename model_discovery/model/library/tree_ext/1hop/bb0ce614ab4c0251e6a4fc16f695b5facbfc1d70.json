    "abstract": "In this work, we tackle the problem of structured text generation, specifically academic paper generation in $\\LaTeX{}$, inspired by the surprisingly good results of basic character-level language models. Our motivation is using more recent and advanced methods of language modeling on a more complex dataset of $\\LaTeX{}$ source files to generate realistic academic papers. Our first contribution is preparing a dataset with $\\LaTeX{}$ source files on recent open-source computer vision papers. Our second contribution is experimenting with recent methods of language modeling and text generation such as Transformer and Transformer-XL to generate consistent $\\LaTeX{}$ code. We report cross-entropy and bits-per-character (BPC) results of the trained models, and we also discuss interesting points on some examples of the generated $\\LaTeX{}$ code.",
