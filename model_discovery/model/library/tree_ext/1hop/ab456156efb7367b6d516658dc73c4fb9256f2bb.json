    "abstract": "High-quality automated poetry generation systems are currently only available for a small subset of languages. We introduce a new model for generating poetry in Czech language, based on fine-tuning a pre-trained Large Language Model. We demonstrate that guiding the generation process by explicitly specifying strophe parameters within the poem text strongly improves the effectiveness of the model. We also find that appropriate tokenization is crucial, showing that tokenization methods based on syllables or individual characters instead of subwords prove superior in generating poetic strophes. We further enhance the results by introducing \\textit{Forced~generation}, adding explicit specifications of meter and verse parameters at inference time based on the already generated text. We evaluate a range of setups, showing that our proposed approach achieves high accuracies in rhyming and metric aspects of formal quality of the generated poems.",
