    "abstract": "The advent of Large Language Models has revolutionized information retrieval, ushering in a new era of expansive knowledge accessibility. While these models excel in providing open-world knowledge, effectively extracting answers in diverse linguistic environments with varying levels of literacy remains a formidable challenge. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerges as a promising solution, bridging the gap between information availability and multilingual comprehension. However, deploying RAG models in real-world scenarios demands careful consideration of various factors. This paper addresses the critical challenges associated with implementing RAG models in multicultural environments. We delve into essential considerations, including data feeding strategies, timely updates, mitigation of hallucinations, prevention of erroneous responses, and optimization of delivery speed. Our work involves the integration of a diverse array of tools, meticulously combined to facilitate the seamless adoption of RAG models across languages and literacy levels within a multicultural organizational context. Through strategic tweaks in our approaches, we achieve not only effectiveness but also efficiency, ensuring the accelerated and accurate delivery of information in a manner that is tailored to the unique requirements of multilingual and multicultural settings.",
