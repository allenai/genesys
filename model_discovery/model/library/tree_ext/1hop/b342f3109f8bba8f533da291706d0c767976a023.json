    "abstract": "Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) [1] have seen explosive growth in the past few years, especially in the domain of image synthesis. Due to the nature of DDPMs, these methods are especially well suited for modelling continuous data. Despite recent work showing that DDPMs outperform other state-of-the-art methods in image synthesis [2], there is limited work applying diffusion methods to the domain of language modelling. We propose a method that uses latent diffusion models for language modelling. Using a sentence autoencoder architecture [3], we map sentences to a continuous latent space and perform diffusion over the latent space.",
