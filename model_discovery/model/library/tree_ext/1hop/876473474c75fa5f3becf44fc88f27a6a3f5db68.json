    "abstract": "Traditional single-model document-level summary extraction methods lack a multi-level representation of features and cannot extract feature information from documents well. To this end, the text uses the BigBird model and Transformer model to extract the sentence features and document features of the document respectively, to obtain a more comprehensive multi-level feature representation of the document and extract a more accurate document summary. In addition, the BigBird model for the sentence encoding layer, which increases the length of the input text sequence through a sparsity attention mechanism, solves the problem that traditional single-model document-level summary extraction methods cannot focus on more comprehensive contextual information and reduces the model time and space complexity. Comparative experiments are conducted on a generic dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",
