    "abstract": "Enhancing AI systems with efficient communication skills for effective human assistance necessitates proactive initiatives from the system side to discern specific circumstances and interact aptly. This research focuses on a collective building assignment in the Minecraft dataset, employing language modeling to enhance task understanding through state-of-the-art methods. These models focus on grounding multi-modal understanding and task-oriented dialogue comprehension tasks, providing insights into their interpretative and responsive capabilities. Our experimental results showcase a substantial improvement over existing methods, indicating a promising direction for future research in this domain.",
