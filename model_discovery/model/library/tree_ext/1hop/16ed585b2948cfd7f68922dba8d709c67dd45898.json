    "abstract": "Use of figurative language, such as metaphors and idioms, is common in our daily-life communications, and it can also be found in Software Engineering (SE) channels, such as comments on GitHub. Automatically interpreting figurative language is a challenging task, even with modern Large Language Models (LLMs), as it often involves subtle nuances. This is particularly true in the SE domain, where figurative language is frequently used to convey technical concepts, often bearing developer affect (e.g., 'spaghetti code). Sur-prisingly, there is a lack of studies on how figurative language in SE communications impacts the performance of automatic tools that focus on understanding developer communications, e.g., bug prior-itization, incivility detection. Furthermore, it is an open question to what extent state-of-the-art LLMs interpret figurative expressions in domain-specific communication such as software engineering. To address this gap, we study the prevalence and impact of figurative language in SE communication channels. This study contributes to understanding the role of figurative language in SE, the potential of LLMs in interpreting them, and its impact on automated SE communication analysis. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of fine-tuning LLMs with figurative language in SE and its potential impact on automated tasks that involve affect. We found that, among three state-of-the-art LLMs, the best improved fine-tuned versions have an average improvement of 6.66% on a GitHub emotion classification dataset, 7.07% on a GitHub incivility classification dataset, and 3.71% on a Bugzilla bug report prioritization dataset.",
