    "abstract": "In this study, we explore how transformer models, which are known for their attention mechanisms, can improve pathogen prediction in pastured poultry farming. By combining farm management practices with microbiome data, our model outperforms traditional prediction methods in terms of the F1 score\u2014an evaluation metric for model performance\u2014thus fulfilling an essential need in predictive microbiology. Additionally, the emphasis is on making our model\u2019s predictions explainable. We introduce a novel approach for identifying feature importance using the model\u2019s attention matrix and the PageRank algorithm, offering insights that enhance our comprehension of established techniques such as DeepLIFT. Our results showcase the efficacy of transformer models in pathogen prediction for food safety and mark a noteworthy contribution to the progress of explainable AI within the biomedical sciences. This study sheds light on the impact of effective farm management practices and highlights the importance of technological advancements in ensuring food safety.",
