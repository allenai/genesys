    "abstract": "In this paper, we repurpose an algorithm from the computational biology literature to detect the extent to which modern document embedding meth-ods are sensitive to \ufb01nancial and micro-economic variables. The contributions are two-fold. First, we provide a novel application of methods from an outside \ufb01eld and show its usefulness for unsupervised discovery of economic information in high-dimensional embeddings of \ufb01nancial documents. Second, we use the quantitative output of the al-gorithm to compare different embedding methods across different economic variables.",
