    "abstract": "A major challenge in education is to provide students with a personalized learning experience. This study aims to address this by developing a dialogue-based intelligent tutoring system (ITS) that imitates human expert tutors. The ITS asks questions, assesses student answers, provides hints, and even chats to encourage student engagement. We constructed the Dialogue-based Reading Comprehension Tutoring (DIRECT) dataset to simulate real-world pedagogical scenarios with the assessment labels and key sentences to support tutoring. The DIRECT dataset is based on RACE, which is a large-scale English reading comprehension dataset. In addition, we propose a neural pipeline approach to model the tutoring tasks and conduct a comprehensive analysis on the results, including a human evaluation. The results show that our model performs well in generating questions, assessing answers, and chatting, showing high potential although some challenges remain. The proposed model provides a good basis for further development of dialogue-based ITSs.",
