    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with attention have been successfully applied for learning visual feature matching. However, current methods learn with complete graphs, resulting in a quadratic complexity in the number of features. Motivated by a prior observation that self- and cross- attention matrices converge to a sparse representation, we propose ClusterGNN, an attentional GNN architecture which operates on clusters for learning the feature matching task. Using a progressive clustering module we adaptively divide keypoints into different subgraphs to reduce redundant connectivity, and employ a coarse-to-fine paradigm for mitigating miss-classification within images. Our approach yields a 59.7% reduction in runtime and 58.4% reduction in memory consumption for dense detection, compared to current state-of-the-art GNN-based matching, while achieving a competitive performance on various computer vision tasks.",
