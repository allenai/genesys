    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel framework SimSeek ( sim ulating information-seek ing conversation from unlabeled documents) and compare two variants of it to provide a deeper perspective into the information-seeking behavior. We \ufb01rst introduce a strong simulator for information-sym metric conversation, SimSeek-sym, where questioner and answerer share all knowledge when conversing with one another. Although it simulates reasonable conversations, we take a further step toward more realistic information-seeking conversation. Hence, we propose SimSeek-asym that assumes information asym metry between two agents, which encourages the questioner to seek new information from an inaccessible document. In our experiments, we demonstrate that SimSeek-asym successfully generates information-seeking conversations for two downstream tasks, CQA and conversational search. In particular, SimSeek-asym improves baseline models by 1.1-1.9 F1 score in QuAC (Choi et al., 2018), and by 1.1 of MRR in OR-QuAC (Qu et al., 2020). Moreover, we thoroughly analyze our synthetic datasets to identify crucial factors for realistic information-seeking conversation.",
