    "abstract": "State-of-the-art meta-learning techniques do not optimize for zero-shot adaptation to unseen tasks, a setting in which humans excel. On the contrary, meta-learning algorithms learn hyperparameters and weight initializations that explicitly optimize for few-shot learning performance. In this work, we take inspiration from recent advances in generative modeling and language-conditioned image synthesis to pro-pose meta-learning techniques that use natural language guidance to achieve higher zero-shot performance compared to the state-of-the-art. We do so by recasting the meta-learning problem as a multi-modal generative modeling problem: given a task, we consider its adapted neural network weights and its natural language description as equivalent multi-modal task representations. We \ufb01rst train an unconditional generative hypernetwork model to produce neural network weights; then we train a second \u201cguidance\u201d model that, given a natural language task description, traverses the hypernetwork latent space to \ufb01nd high-performance task-adapted weights in a zero-shot manner. We explore two alternative approaches for latent space guidance: \u201cHyperCLIP\u201d-based classi\ufb01er guidance and a conditional Hypernetwork Latent Diffusion Model (\u201cHyperLDM\u201d), which we show to bene\ufb01t",
