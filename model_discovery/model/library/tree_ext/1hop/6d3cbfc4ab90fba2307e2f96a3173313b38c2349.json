The system utilises state-of-the-art contextualised word embeddings, which have some task-specific adaptations, including stacked embeddings and average embeddings. Overall, the approach achieves good evaluation scores across all the languages, while maintaining simplicity. Following the final rankings, our approach is ranked within the top 5 solutions of each language while preserving the 1st position of Finnish subtask 2.",
