    "abstract": "Generated synthetic data in medical research can substitute privacy and security-sensitive data with a large-scale curated dataset, reducing data collection and annotation costs. As part of this effort, we propose UniXGen, a uni\ufb01ed chest X-ray and report generation model, with the following contributions. First, we design a uni\ufb01ed model for bidirectional chest X-ray and report generation by adopting a vector quantization method to discretize chest X-rays into discrete visual tokens and formulating both tasks as sequence generation tasks. Second, we introduce several special tokens to generate chest X-rays with speci\ufb01c views that can be useful when the desired views are unavailable. Furthermore, UniXGen can \ufb02exibly take various inputs from single to multiple views to take advantage of the additional \ufb01ndings available in other X-ray views. We adopt an ef\ufb01cient transformer for computational and memory ef\ufb01ciency to handle the long-range input sequence of multi-view chest X-rays with high resolution and long paragraph reports. In extensive experiments, we show that our uni\ufb01ed model has a synergistic effect on both generation tasks, as opposed to training only the task-speci\ufb01c models. We also \ufb01nd that view-speci\ufb01c special tokens can distinguish between different views and properly generate speci\ufb01c views even if they do not exist in the dataset, and utilizing multi-view chest X-rays can faithfully capture the abnormal \ufb01ndings",
