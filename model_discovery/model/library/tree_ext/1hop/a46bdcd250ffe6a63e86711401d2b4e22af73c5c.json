    "abstract": "Emotion-Cause analysis has attracted the attention of researchers in recent years. However, most existing datasets are limited in size and number of emotion categories. They often focus on extracting parts of the document that contain the emotion cause and fail to provide more abstractive, generalizable root cause. To bridge this gap, we introduce a large-scale dataset of emotion causes, derived from 9.8 million cleaned tweets over 15 years. We describe our curation process, which includes a comprehensive pipeline for data gathering, cleaning, labeling, and validation, ensuring the dataset's reliability and richness. We extract emotion labels and provide abstractive summarization of the events causing emotions. The final dataset comprises over 700,000 tweets with corresponding emotion-cause pairs spanning 48 emotion classes, validated by human evaluators. The novelty of our dataset stems from its broad spectrum of emotion classes and the abstractive emotion cause that facilitates the development of an emotion-cause knowledge graph for nuanced reasoning. Our dataset will enable the design of emotion-aware systems that account for the diverse emotional responses of different people for the same event.",
