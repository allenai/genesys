    "abstract": "This study addresses the task of Unknown Sense Detection in English and Swedish. The primary objective of this task is to determine whether the meaning of a particular word usage is documented in a dictionary or not. For this purpose, sense entries are compared with word usages from modern and historical corpora using a pre-trained Word-in-Context embedder that allows us to model this task in a few-shot scenario. Additionally, we use human annotations to adapt and evaluate our models. Compared to a random sample from a corpus, our model is able to considerably increase the detected number of word usages with non-recorded senses.",
