    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce ShortCircuit, a new open-source front-end digital design tool that uses the OpenLane flow and the ChatGPT. AI to automate the generation of HDL design files for a specific problem. Furthermore, ShortCircuit supports the automatic generation of GDS files for ASIC designs targeting SkyWater 130nm CMOS technology, and bitstream files for various FPGA devices as well as programming them. To our knowledge, this work is the first study that uses the ChatGPT AI engine to fully automate the digital IC design flow from specification to silicon.",
