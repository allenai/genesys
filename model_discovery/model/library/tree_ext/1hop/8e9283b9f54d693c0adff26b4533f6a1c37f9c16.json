    "abstract": "This paper introduces an AI-powered healthcare system for the elderly, leveraging the advanced BERT algorithm. The platform utilizes BERT for mood tracking through journal writing, enabling nuanced assessment of mental health. Machine learning, based on contextual understanding, detects conditions like loneliness and depression with heightened accuracy, aiding in early detection. To combat social isolation, virtual companionship and access to support groups are introduced. In medication management, BERT ensures adherence, sending reminders and detecting potential interactions. This integrated approach revolutionizes elderly care by addressing physical, mental, and social well-being. The system aims to enhance the overall quality of life for the aging population, promoting independence, health, and belonging. With a rising global aging population, this AI solution is poised to make a substantial impact on senior care, demonstrating promising outcomes in accuracy and efficiency.",
