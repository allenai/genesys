    "abstract": "The user experience of an asynchronous video interview system is often deemed non-interactive and one-sided. Interview candidates anticipate them to be natural and coherent like a traditional face-to-face interview. One aspect of improving the interaction is by asking relevant follow-up questions based on the previously asked questions, and its answers. We propose a follow-up question generation model capable of generating relevant and diverse follow-up questions. We develop a 3D virtual interviewing system, Maya , equipped with follow-up question generator. Many existing asynchronous interviewing systems pose questions that are \ufb01xed and scripted. Maya , on the contrary, reacts with relevant follow-up questions, a relatively unexplored dimen-sion in virtual interviewing systems. We leverage the implicit knowledge from deep pre-trained language models along with a small corpus of interview questions to generate rich and diverse follow-up questions in natural language. The generated questions achieve 77% relevance with human evaluation. We compare our follow-up question generation model with strong baselines of neural network and rule-based systems and show that it produces better quality questions.",
