    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of the e\u2010commerce market facilitated, users are often overwhelmed by the excessive online information, making item selection challenging. While recommendation services have significantly enhanced user experience and sales, these traditional models often overlook the complexity of user\u2010item interactions and user preferences based on various item aspects. The proposed AXCF framework innovatively combines graph\u2010based collaborative filtering (CF), which captures high\u2010order connectivity between users and items, with aspect\u2010based sentiment analysis (ABSA) to extract detailed user preferences from online reviews. This approach addresses the limitations of linear relationships in traditional CF models by incorporating deep neural networks and introduces a method to overcome the cold\u2010start problem using online reviews as auxiliary information. By focusing on main aspects such as food, ambiance, and service derived from restaurant reviews, AXCF provides personalized recommendations with improved accuracy and explanatory power, demonstrating its superiority over existing models through experimental results. This study not only presents a significant advancement in recommender systems but also highlights the importance of high\u2010order connectivity and aspect\u2010based preferences in understanding and catering to user needs in the e\u2010commerce platform.",
