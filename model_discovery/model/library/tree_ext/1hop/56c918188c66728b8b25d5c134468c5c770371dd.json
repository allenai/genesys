    "abstract": "When faced with long text input, the generated results from large language models sometimes fail to meet user expectations. Due to the length and complexity of the input content, users often do not know how to modify the input to obtain the desired results. To address this dilemma, we propose a Prompt optimization method for large language models with long text input. This method determines the influence weights of different semantic segments on the results, providing guidance for users to generate desired text using large language models. Experimental results show that by evaluating the importance of different semantic segments in military question-answering system text and improving the input content, the quality and usability of the generated military question-answering text can be enhanced.",
