    "abstract": "The demand for multimodal dialogue systems has been rising in various domains, emphasizing the importance of interpreting multimodal inputs from conversational and situational contexts. One main challenge in multimodal dialogue understanding is multimodal object identification, which constitutes the ability to identify objects relevant to a multimodal user-system conversation. We explore three methods to tackle this problem and evaluate them on the largest situated dialogue dataset, SIMMC 2.1. Our best method, scene-dialogue alignment, improves the performance by ~20% F1-score compared to the SIMMC 2.1 baselines. We provide analysis and discussion regarding the limitation of our methods and the potential directions for future works.",
