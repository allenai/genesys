    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the influence of claims in analyst reports and earnings calls on financial market returns, considering them as significant quarterly events for publicly traded companies. To facilitate a comprehensive analysis, we construct a new financial dataset for the claim detection task in the financial domain. We benchmark various language models on this dataset and propose a novel weak-supervision model that incorporates the knowledge of subject matter experts (SMEs) in the aggregation function, outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of our proposed model by constructing a novel measure ``optimism\". Furthermore, we observed the dependence of earnings surprise and return on our optimism measure. Our dataset, models, and code will be made publicly (under CC BY 4.0 license) available on GitHub and Hugging Face.",
