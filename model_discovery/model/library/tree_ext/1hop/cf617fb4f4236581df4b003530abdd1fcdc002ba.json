    "abstract": "Writing is a critical skill for success and automated tools for evaluating written documents are becoming commonplace. While numerous examples of automated writing feedback tools exist, most either fail to identify writing structure or exist as proprietary algorithms that are inaccessible to educators of under-funded schools thus disproportionately affecting a number of low-income and minority students. To address this, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is sponsoring a competition where NLP researchers get a chance to build a model to classify student writing into its key argumentative components, a difficult text classification problem that requires large, pretrained, state-of-the-art models. Our team presents several candidate models including a Longformer with Oversampling, and a combined Longformer and BigBird model, the best of which classified components with a 69.1% accuracy. You can find the open-source code for our experiments on GitHub: https://github.com/pythonicode/cs224n-final.",
