    "abstract": "In this paper we build two models for the question-answering task on SQuAD 2.0 dataset: BiDAF (Bi-Directional Attention Flow) network and QANet. Based on vanilla BiDAF baseline model we first adopt coattention mechanism from Dynamic Coattention Network into BiDAF. Secondly we re-implement QANet. These two models get 61.855/62.309 EM and 65.309/65.595 F1 on development set respectively. Fusing Performer technique into QANet is also explored. Finally, we use a voting scheme ensemble model to achieve F1 = 68.35 on dev set and F1 = 65.69 on test set 1 .",
