    "abstract": "Legal text is difficult to understand and requires domain-specific knowledge to read. This work aims to investigate the effect that model stacking and input processing have on information fidelity with the motivation to explore possibilities of expanding the accessibility of legal texts. We developed a legal dictionary through the United States Courts\u2019 Glossary of Legal Terms1 to map complex terms into simple English and used FLAN-T5 to summarize observations. To evaluate performance, we used binary text classification to predict case holdings using LLMs (Large Language Models) and evaluated the results with and without model pretraining. To assess information fidelity, we ask: \u201dDoes model stacking affect classification performance?\u201d and \u201dDoes performance change with pretraining?\u201d",
