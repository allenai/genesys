    "abstract": "Advances in the computer-composition of music have enabled algorithms to compose music similar to that composed by humans. However, these algorithms are generally tested only on the more mainstream genres like jazz, pop, and classical, while other, more niche genres are neglected. This leaves some doubt as to how generally these algorithms can perform. In this research paper, we gathered three pre-existing computer-composition algorithms and tested them on the task of generating Video Game Music (VGM). Their generated samples, as well as human-made samples, were presented in an online survey which performed both a Turing test and a Mean Opinion Score test. While one model failed to train, results for the remaining two showed that human-made music performed by far the best, followed by the LakhNES (Transformer) model, and lastly the DeepJ (LSTM) model. For the most part, computer composed music did not compare to human-made. However, results did show the LakhNES model capable of generating music that humans could not accurately identify as computer-generated.",
