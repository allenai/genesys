    "abstract": "The descriptions of complex events usually span sentences, so we need to extract complete event information from the whole document. To address the challenges of document-level event extraction, we propose a novel framework named Document-level Event Extraction as Relation Extraction (DEERE), which is suitable for document-level event extraction tasks without trigger-word labelling. By well-designed task transformation, DEERE remodels event extraction as single-stage relation extraction, which can mitigate error propagation. A long text supported encoder is adopted in the relation extraction model to aware the global context effectively. A fault-tolerant event integration algorithm is designed to improve the prediction accuracy. Experimental results show that our approach advances the SOTA for the ChFinAnn dataset by an average F1-score of 3.7. The code and data are available at https://github.com/maomaotfntfn/DEERE.",
