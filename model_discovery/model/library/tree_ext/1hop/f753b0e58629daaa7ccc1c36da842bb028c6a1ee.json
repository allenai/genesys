    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for real-world machine learning. Outlier exposure methods, which use auxiliary outlier data, can significantly enhance OOD detection. We present Hopfield Boosting, a boosting technique employing modern Hopfield energy (MHE) to refine the decision boundary between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data. Our method focuses on challenging outlier examples near the decision boundary, achieving a 40% improvement in FPR95 on CIFAR-10, setting a new state-of-the-art in OOD detection with outlier exposure.",
