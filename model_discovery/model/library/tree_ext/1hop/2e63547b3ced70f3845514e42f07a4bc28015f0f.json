    "abstract": "The introduction of ChatGPT is seen as a potential chance to improve second language learning and instruction. However, the acceptance of technology in education is dependent on instructors' views. As a consequence, it is vital to explore how EFL teachers assess the implementation of ChatGPT in language classes, particularly in Vietnam, where research on this topic is scarce. The goal of this study is to learn about EFL teachers' thoughts on using ChatGPT in writing sessions and to gather ideas for its implementation. The research involved twenty Van Lang University EFL teachers who utilized ChatGPT in their language education and taught numerous writing courses. An online survey and a structured interview were used to collect quantitative and qualitative data. The study's results show that EFL instructors at Van Lang University are enthusiastic about using ChatGPT in writing lessons. Furthermore, the research emphasizes the necessity of professional training for instructors, boosting user knowledge of the limits and possible hazards connected with ChatGPT, and assuring correct chatbot use as critical elements that contribute to its successful deployment.",
