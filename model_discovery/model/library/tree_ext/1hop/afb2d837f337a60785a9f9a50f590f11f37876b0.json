    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Our research strives to examine how simulation models of logistics systems can be produced automatically from verbal descriptions in natural language and how human experts and artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems can collaborate in the domain of simulation modelling. We demonstrate that a framework constructed upon the refined GPT-3 Codex is capable of generating functionally valid simulations for queuing and inventory management systems when provided with a verbal explanation. As a result, the language model could produce simulation models for inventory and process control. These results, along with the rapid improvement of language models, enable a significant simplification of simulation model development. Our study offers guidelines and a design of a natural language processing-based framework on how to build simulation models of logistics systems automatically, given the verbal description. In generalised terms, our work offers a technological underpinning of human-AI collaboration for the development of simulation models.",
