    "abstract": "Fake news significantly influence our society. They impact consumers, voters, and many other societal groups. While Fake News exist for a centuries, Generative AI brings fake news on a new level. It is now possible to automate the creation of masses of high-quality individually targeted Fake News. On the other end, Generative AI can also help detecting Fake News. Both fields are young but developing fast. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of the research and practical use of Generative AI for Fake News detection and creation in 2024. Following the Structured Literature Survey approach, the paper synthesizes current results in the following topic clusters 1) enabling technologies, 2) creation of Fake News, 3) case study social media as most relevant distribution channel, 4) detection of Fake News, and 5) deepfakes as upcoming technology. The article also identifies current challenges and open issues.",
