    "abstract": "Writing and genre conventions are extant to any scientific community, and CHI is no different. In this paper, we present the early phases of an AI tool called KITSUNE, which takes text and adapts it toward the writing conventions of a CHI paper. We describe the development of the tool with the intent to promote discussion around how writing conventions are upheld and unquestioned by the CHI community, and how this translates to the work produced. In addition, we bring up questions surrounding how the introduction of LLMs into academic writing will fundamentally change how conventions will be upheld now and in the future.",
