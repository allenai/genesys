    "abstract": "Prompting interfaces allow users to quickly adjust the output of generative models in both vision and language. However, small changes and design choices in the prompt can lead to signi\ufb01cant differences in the output. In this work, we develop a black-box framework for generating adversarial prompts for unstructured image and text generation. These prompts, which can be standalone or prepended to benign prompts, induce speci\ufb01c behaviors into the generative process, such as generating images of a particular object or biasing the frequency of speci\ufb01c letters in the generated text.",
