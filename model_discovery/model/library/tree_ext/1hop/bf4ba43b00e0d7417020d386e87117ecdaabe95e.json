    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), as the case of OpenAI ChatGPT-4 Turbo, are revolutionizing several industries, including higher education. In this context, LLMs can be personalized through a fine-tuning process to meet the student demands on every particular subject, like statistics. Recently, OpenAI has launched the possibility to fine-tune their model with a natural language web interface, enabling the possibility to create customized GPT version deliberately conditioned to meet the demands of a specific task. The objective of this research is to assess the potential of the customized GPTs that have recently been launched by OpenAI. After developing a Business Statistics Virtual Professor (BSVP), tailored for students at the Universidad Pontificia Comillas, its behavior was evaluated and compared with that of ChatGPT-4 Turbo. The results lead to several conclusions. Firstly, a substantial modification in the style of communication was observed. Following the instructions it was trained with, BSVP provided responses in a more relatable and friendly tone, even incorporating a few minor jokes. Secondly, and this is a matter of relevance, when explicitly asked for something like,\"I would like to practice a programming exercise similar to those in R practice 4,\"BSVP was capable of providing a far superior response: having access to contextual documentation, it could fulfill the request, something beyond ChatGPT-4 Turbo's capabilities. On the downside, the response times were generally higher. Lastly, regarding overall performance, quality, depth, and alignment with the specific content of the course, no statistically significant differences were observed in the responses between BSVP and ChatGPT-4 Turbo. It appears that customized assistants trained with prompts present advantages as virtual aids for students, yet they do not constitute a substantial improvement over ChatGPT-4 Turbo.",
