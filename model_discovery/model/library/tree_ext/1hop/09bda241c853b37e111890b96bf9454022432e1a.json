    "abstract": "This comprehensive literature review explores the integration of Darwinian theory, specifically natural selection and evolution, within the context of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT). GPT, an advanced language model, has shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, but its underlying mechanisms can be enhanced by incorporating principles from Darwinian theory. This review examines theoretical frameworks, empirical studies, and methodological approaches used to integrate Darwinian theory into GPT. The findings highlight the potential benefits, challenges, and future research directions in merging these two domains.",
