    "abstract": "Current conversational agents (CA) have seen improvement in conversational quality in recent years due to the influence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT3. However, two key categories of problem remain. Firstly there are the unique technical problems resulting from the approach taken in creating the CA, such as scope with retrieval agents and the often nonsensical answers of former generative agents. Secondly, humans perceive CAs as social actors, and as a result expect the CA to adhere to social convention. Failure on the part of the CA in this respect can lead to a poor interaction and even the perception of threat by the user. As such, this paper presents a survey highlighting a potential solution to both categories of problem through the introduction of cognitively inspired additions to the CA. Through computational facsimiles of semantic and episodic memory, emotion, working memory, and the ability to learn, it is possible to address both the technical and social problems encountered by CAs.",
