    "abstract": "We propose a framework for holistic static and animated 3D scene generation from diverse text descriptions. Prior works of scene generation rely on static rule-based entity extraction from natural language description. However, this limits the usability of a practical solution. To overcome this limitation, we use one of state-of-the-art architecture - TransformerXL. Instead of rule-based extraction, our framework leverages the rich contextual encoding which allows us to process a larger range (diverse) of possible natural language descriptions. We empirically show how our proposed mechanism generalizes even on novel combinations of object-features during inference. We also show how our framework can jointly generate static and animated 3D scene efficiently. We modify CLEVR to generate a large, scalable dataset - Integrated static and animated 3D scene (Iscene). Data preparation code and pre-trained model available at - this https URL.",
