    "abstract": "In this work we introduce Steerable Transformers, an extension of the Vision Transformer mechanism that maintains equivariance to the special Euclidean group $\\mathrm{SE}(d)$. We propose an equivariant attention mechanism that operates on features extracted by steerable convolutions. Operating in Fourier space, our network utilizes Fourier space non-linearities. Our experiments in both two and three dimensions show that adding a steerable transformer encoder layer to a steerable convolution network enhances performance.",
