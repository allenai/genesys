    "abstract": "The recent progress in natural language processing research has been supported by the development of a rich open source ecosystem in Python. Libraries allowing NLP practitioners but also non-specialists to leverage state-of-the-art models have been instrumental in the democratization of this technology. The maturity of the open-source NLP ecosystem however varies between languages. This work proposes a new open-source library aimed at bringing state-of-the-art NLP to Rust. Rust is a systems programming language for which the foundations required to build machine learning applications are available but still lacks ready-to-use, end-to-end NLP libraries. The proposed library, rust-bert, implements modern language models and ready-to-use pipelines (for example translation or summarization). This allows further development by the Rust community from both NLP experts and non-specialists. It is hoped that this library will accelerate the development of the NLP ecosystem in Rust. The library is under active development and available at https://github.com/guillaume-be/rust-bert.",
