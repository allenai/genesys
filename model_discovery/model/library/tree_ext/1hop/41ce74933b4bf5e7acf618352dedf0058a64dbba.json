    "abstract": "Social media data is plagued by the redundancy problem caused by its noisy nature, leading to increased training time and model bias. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called generative deduplication. It aims to remove duplicate text from noisy social media data and mitigate model bias. By doing so, it can improve social media language understanding performance and save training time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed generative deduplication can effectively reduce training samples while improving performance. This evidence suggests the effectiveness of generative deduplication and its importance in social media language understanding.",
