    "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of formulating decision making as a supervised learning problem on of\ufb02ine-collected trajectories. However, the bene\ufb01ts of performing sequence modeling on trajectory data is not yet clear. In this work we investigate if sequence modeling has the capability to condense trajectories into useful representations that can contribute to policy learning. To achieve this, we adopt a two-stage framework that \ufb01rst summarizes trajectories with sequence modeling techniques, and then employs these representations to learn a policy along with a desired goal. This design allows many existing supervised of\ufb02ine RL methods to be considered as speci\ufb01c instances of our framework. Within this framework, we introduce Goal-Conditioned Predicitve Coding (GCPC), an approach that brings powerful trajectory representations and leads to performant policies. We conduct extensive empirical evaluations on AntMaze, FrankaKitchen and Locomotion environments, and observe that sequence modeling has a signi\ufb01cant impact on some decision making tasks. In addition, we demonstrate that GCPC learns a goal-conditioned latent representation about the future, which serves as an \u201cimplicit planner\u201d, and enables competitive performance on all three benchmarks.",
