    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Auxiliary Memory Sterling Suggs Department of Computer Science, BYU Master of Science Deep reinforcement learning algorithms typically require vast amounts of data to train to a useful level of performance. Each time new data is encountered, the network must inefficiently update all of its parameters. Auxiliary memory units can help deep neural networks train more efficiently by separating computation from storage, and providing a means to rapidly store and retrieve precise information. We present four deep reinforcement learning models augmented with external memory, and benchmark their performance on ten tasks from the Arcade Learning Environment. Our discussion and insights will be helpful for future RL researchers developing their own memory agents.",
