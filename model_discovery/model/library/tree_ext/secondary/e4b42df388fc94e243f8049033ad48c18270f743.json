    "title": "IES3: a fast integral equation solver for efficient 3-dimensional extraction",
    "abstract": "Integral equation techniques are often used to extract models of integrated circuit structures. This extraction involves solving a dense system of linear equations, and using direct solution methods is prohibitive for large problems. In this paper, we present IES/sup 3/ (pronounced \"ice cube\"), a fast Integral Equation Solver for three-dimensional problems with arbitrary kernels. Extraction methods based on IES/sup 3/ are substantially more efficient than existing multipole-based approaches.",
