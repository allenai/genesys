    "title": "A Framework for Evaluating the Effect of View Angle, Clothing and Carrying Condition on Gait Recognition",
    "abstract": "Gait recognition has gained increasing interest from researchers, but there is still no standard evaluation method to compare the performance of different gait recognition algorithms. In this paper, a framework is proposed in an attempt to tackle this problem. The framework consists of a large gait database, a large set of well designed experiments and some evaluation metrics. There are 124 subjects in the database, and the gait data was captured from 11 views. Three variations, namely view angle, clothing and carrying condition changes, are separately considered in the database. The database is one of the largest database among the existing databases. Three sets of experiments, including a total of 363 experiments, are designed in the framework. Some metrics are proposed to evaluate gait recognition algorithms",
