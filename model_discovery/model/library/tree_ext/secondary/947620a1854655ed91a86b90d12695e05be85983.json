    "abstract": "Our challenge is clear: The drive for performance and the end of voltage scaling have made power, and not the number of transistors, the principal factor limiting further improvements in computing performance. Continuing to scale compute performance will require the creation and effective use of new specialized compute engines, and will require the participation of application experts to be successful. If we play our cards right, and develop the tools that allow our customers to become part of the design process, we will create a new wave of innovative and efficient computing devices.",
