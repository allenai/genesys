Last update: Feb. 26, 2010. About this Book This book is for the reader who wants to understand how data compression works, or who wants to write data compression software. Prior programming ability and some math skills will be needed. Specific topics include: \uf0b7 Information theory: entropy and algorithmic complexity, and the relationship to artificial intelligence. \uf0b7 Benchmarks. \uf0b7 Coding: Huffman, arithmetic, asymmetric binary. \uf0b7 Modeling: fixed order, variable order (PPM), context mixing (PAQ). Static vs. dynamic. \uf0b7 Transforms: run length, string matching (LZ77), dictionary (LZW), context sorting (BWT), symbol ranking, predictive filters, E8E9, recompression. \uf0b7 Lossy compression for images (JPEG), video (MPEG), and audio (MP3).
