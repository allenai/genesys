    "title": "The Spectrum Kernel: A String Kernel for SVM Protein Classification",
    "abstract": "We introduce a new sequence-similarity kernel, the spectrum kernel, for use with support vector machines (SVMs) in a discriminative approach to the protein classification problem. Our kernel is conceptually simple and efficient to compute and, in experiments on the SCOP database, performs well in comparison with state-of-the-art methods for homology detection. Moreover, our method produces an SVM classifier that allows linear time classification of test sequences. Our experiments provide evidence that string-based kernels, in conjunction with SVMs, could offer a viable and computationally efficient alternative to other methods of protein classification and homology detection.",
