    "title": "Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network for Document Modeling",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel hierarchical recurrent neural network language model (HRNNLM) for document modeling. After establishing a RNN to capture the coherence between sentences in a document, HRNNLM integrates it as the sentence history information into the word level RNN to predict the word sequence with cross-sentence contextual information. A two-step training approach is designed, in which sentence-level and word-level language models are approximated for the convergence in a pipeline style. Examined by the standard sentence reordering scenario, HRNNLM is proved for its better accuracy in modeling the sentence coherence. And at the word level, experimental results also indicate a significant lower model perplexity, followed by a practical better translation result when applied to a Chinese-English document translation reranking task.",
