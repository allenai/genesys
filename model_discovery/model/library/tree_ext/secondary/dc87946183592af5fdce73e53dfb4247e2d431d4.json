    "abstract": "Experiments are performed that demonstrate some of the functional properties of short-term storage in the visual system, its decay, readout and erasure. Results indicate that the visual process involves a buffer storage which includes an erasure mechanism that is local in character and tends to erase stored information when new information is put in. Storage time appears to be of the order of one-quarter second; storage capacity is more difficult to assess.",
