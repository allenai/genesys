    "title": "Parallel computing using the prefix problem",
    "abstract": "The prefix operation on a set of data is one of the simplest and most useful building blocks in parallel algorithms. This introduction to those aspects of parallel programming and parallel algorithms that relate to the prefix problem emphasizes its use in a broad range of familiar and important problems. The book illustrates how the prefix operation approach to parallel computing leads to fast and efficient solutions to many different kinds of problems. Students, lecturers, and programmers will want to read this clear exposition of an important approach.",
