    "title": "The conference paper",
    "abstract": "Purpose - A satire on conference paper presentations. Design/methodology/approach - A poetic critique of conference presenters and their occasional failure to engage with their audience. Findings - What may be fascinating and of assumed and obvious importance to a research presenter may be quite obscure to their audience, who nonetheless participate in the ritual of conference attendance and polite \u201clistening\u201d. Research limitations/implications - The reader may discover even more meaning in this poem than its original author envisaged. Originality/value - A poignant reminder of the perils of many conference presentations.",
