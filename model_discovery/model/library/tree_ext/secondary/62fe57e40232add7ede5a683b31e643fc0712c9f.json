    "title": "Bidirectional associative memories",
    "abstract": "Stability and encoding properties of two-layer nonlinear feedback neural networks are examined. Bidirectionality is introduced in neural nets to produce two-way associative search for stored associations. The bidirectional associative memory (BAM) is the minimal two-layer nonlinear feedback network. The author proves that every n-by-p matrix M is a bidirectionally stable heteroassociative content-addressable memory for both binary/bipolar and continuous neurons. When the BAM neutrons are activated, the network quickly evolves to a stable state of two-pattern reverberation, or resonance. The stable reverberation corresponds to a system energy local minimum. Heteroassociative information is encoded in a BAM by summing correlation matrices. The BAM storage capacity for reliable recall is roughly m<min (n,p). It is also shown that it is better on average to use bipolar (-1,1) coding than binary",
