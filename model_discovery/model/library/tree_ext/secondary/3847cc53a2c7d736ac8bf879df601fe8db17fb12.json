    "abstract": "Wavelet and short-time Fourier analysis is introduced in the context of frequency decompositions. Wavelet type frequency decompositions are associated with lter banks, and using this fact, lter bank theory is used to construct multiplicity M wavelet frames and tight frames. The way in which lter banks lead to decomposition and recomposition of arbitrary separable Hilbert spaces is also described. E cient computational structures for both lter banks and wavelets are also discussed. Contact Address: Ramesh A.
