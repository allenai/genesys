    "title": "Exploiting sequence-based features for predicting enhancer\u2013promoter interactions",
    "abstract": "Motivation: A large number of distal enhancers and proximal promoters form enhancer\u2010promoter interactions to regulate target genes in the human genome. Although recent high\u2010throughput genome\u2010wide mapping approaches have allowed us to more comprehensively recognize potential enhancer\u2010promoter interactions, it is still largely unknown whether sequence\u2010based features alone are sufficient to predict such interactions. Results: Here, we develop a new computational method (named PEP) to predict enhancer\u2010promoter interactions based on sequence\u2010based features only, when the locations of putative enhancers and promoters in a particular cell type are given. The two modules in PEP (PEP\u2010Motif and PEP\u2010Word) use different but complementary feature extraction strategies to exploit sequence\u2010based information. The results across six different cell types demonstrate that our method is effective in predicting enhancer\u2010promoter interactions as compared to the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art methods that use functional genomic signals. Our work demonstrates that sequence\u2010based features alone can reliably predict enhancer\u2010promoter interactions genome\u2010wide, which could potentially facilitate the discovery of important sequence determinants for long\u2010range gene regulation.
