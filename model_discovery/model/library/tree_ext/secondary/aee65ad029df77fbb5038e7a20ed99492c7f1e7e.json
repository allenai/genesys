    "title": "Extracting contract elements",
    "abstract": "We study how contract element extraction can be automated. We provide a labeled dataset with gold contract element annotations, along with an unlabeled dataset of contracts that can be used to pre-train word embeddings. Both datasets are provided in an encoded form to bypass privacy issues. We describe and experimentally compare several contract element extraction methods that use manually written rules and linear classifiers (logistic regression, SVMs) with hand-crafted features, word embeddings, and part-of-speech tag embeddings. The best results are obtained by a hybrid method that combines machine learning (with hand-crafted features and embeddings) and manually written post-processing rules.",
