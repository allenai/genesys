    "title": "File Change Semantics and the Familiarity Theory of Definiteness",
    "abstract": "This has been labeled the ``familiarity theory of definiteness.'' When confronted with (1), the logically minded semanticist will notice immediately that it presumes something very objectionable: that definites and indefinites are referring expressions. For only if there is a referent at all can there be any question of its familiarity or novelty. Advocates of (1) cannot happily admit that there are nonreferring uses of definites or indefinites (or both), because that would be tantamount to admitting that their theory leaves the definite-indefinite-contrast in a significant subset of NP uses unaccounted for. But the existence of nonreferential uses of definite and indefinite NPs can hardly be denied, and I will take it for granted without repeating the familiar arguments. Just think of examples like (2) and (3).",
