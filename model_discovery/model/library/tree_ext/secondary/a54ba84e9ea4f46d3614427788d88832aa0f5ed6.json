    "abstract": "My project aims to understand how United Farm Workers (UFW) leadership appealed to historical memory to build a multi-ethnic, multi-racial identity among California's agriculture laborers. I will examine visual, written, and spoken allusions to popular historical events to understand this rhetorical strategy. Chief among these subjects are Mexican revolutionaries. I employ several issues of El Malcriado (the UFW's newspaper) that refer to Emiliano Zapata and Pancho Villa in writing or drawings. I also hope to include Aztec symbols, religious imagery, American politicians, union leaders, and celebrities. Background: enforcement one of the most stressful and high-risk occupations in the United States. Inherent dangers present in law enforcement have long-term effects on officer physical and mental health, contributing to higher rates of morbidity and mortality in law enforcement. At present, evidence is needed about the emic (insider) and etic (outsider) values and beliefs that impact officer health practices. Purpose: The purpose of this mini ethnonursing study was to understand the cultural perceptions and beliefs of Northern Nevada Law Enforcement Academy cadets on officer wellness. The research questions that guided the study were: 1) what are the cultural perceptions and beliefs of law enforcement cadets in a Northern Nevada Law Enforcement Academy on officer wellness; and 2) what is the role of nursing in promoting and improving officer Methods: The study used a qualitative ethnonursing design to understand cadet perceptions and beliefs about officer wellness. This method also allowed the researcher to determine care methods that can promote culturally competent and congruent care. Four cadet participants were recruited from a Northern Nevada Law Enforcement Academy with the assistance of organizational leader ship, and were interviewed individually. Leininger\u2019s four phases of data analysis were used to identify initial findings. Results: All participants were male and aged between 25-35 years. Two participants identified as white, one identified as non-white Hispanic, and one participant identified as African American. Twelve categories of data emerged, such as law enforcement culture, officer wellness, and technology/social media. These categories supported one pattern: a higher calling to serve. Data saturation was not met. Discussion: Further research through a full-scale study is needed to explore these identified cultural implications on officer health and wellness, especially as the cadets\u2019 immersion in the law enforcement culture continues. This research will help to inform specific avenues for nursing to help improve officer health and wellness, through understanding the beliefs, values, and practices from a cultural context impacting their calling to serve. phenomenological mini study. The participants were three women with ages ranging from 25-44 years old. Data was collected in one individual interview with each of the participants via recorded Zoom meeting. Data was analyzed using Giorgi\u2019s (1997) five basic steps. Results: Initial data resulted in six break in codes; anger, lack of PPE, poor patient care, sadness, safe environment and unsupported. The data was then further analyzed into 4 organized nursing codes of grief and sadness, lack of organizational support, patient care delivery and safe work environment. Conclusions and Implications: Initial data warrants further study. Further research must be done to better understand if initial data correlates to a broader nursing population. This research could have implications to the general well-being of ICU nurses after caring for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and potentially why they are leaving the bedside. potential impact intubation Background: The gastrocnemius muscle is a superficial two-headed muscle located in the posterior compartment of the leg, consisting of two heads: medial head and lateral head. The gastrocnemius muscle plays a significant role in our daily activities because its function is plantar flexing the foot at the ankle joint and flexing the leg at the knee joint. We report a very rare case of fatty gastrocnemius. Methods: The abnormal gastrocnemius muscles were encountered during the dissection of the lower limbs of a 63-year-old female cadaver. For histological examination, muscular samples were sectioned from the top, middle, and bottom of two heads of both legs. A total of six muscular slides, nerve slides, artery slides were all stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stains. Slides were analyzed using light microscopy. Result: For anatomy analysis, the medial heads of both gastrocnemius muscles of the lower limbs are completely infiltrated by adipose tissue. But the lateral heads of gastrocnemius muscles on both sides are almost healthy. Only the bottom of the lateral head of gastrocnemius muscles shows adipose tissue, but the middle and top do not. Additionally, the medial heads connect to the tibial nerve and arteries normally. No abnormal adipose tissue was observed in other muscles throughout the body. For histological analysis, the entire medial heads and the bottom lateral heads are replaced by adipose cells, but the middle and top of the lateral heads are healthy muscle cells. No abnormalities or pathologies were observed in the nerves or arteries. Conclusion: Both medial heads of the gastrocnemius muscle appear to have become adipose tissue. While no underlying differences in efficacy of mechanical hypersensitivity relief by nanotherapeutic correlates to macrophage infiltration influence of the T cell. This study uses a novel nanotherapeutic to block the production of PGE2, thereby, decreasing mechanical hypersensitivity and local inflammation of macrophages. Following chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve, both male and female rats experience equivalent mechanical hypersensitivity, in addition to both attaining significant relief following nanotherapy. Interestingly, while a standard dose of the nanotherapeutic provides significant relief from hypersensitivity for males, persisting for 5 \u2013 6 days, the same dose in females provides significant, but attenuated relief. Immunohistochemistry of the right sciatic nerve for males treated with the nanotherapeutic shows a correlation in the decreased number of infiltrating macrophages at the site of injury compared to the level of mechanical hypersensitivity relief. Equivalent analysis of females reveals that while there is a reduction in the number of infiltrating macrophages, they have a higher number of macrophages present than the males. The trend of higher inflammation in females after injury was again supported through the visualization of CD8 positive cells. Lastly, infiltration of T cells was evident in the epineural sheath of the injured nerve, but there was no difference between sex or treatment with nanotherapeutic. study is to determine if the concentration of fructose can be used as a detection method for semen. In this study, the concentration of fructose in semen, blood, urine, and vaginal fluid samples were determined by identifying the amount of free fructose in each sample with the use of a fluorometric assay. This fluorometric assay takes the free fructose in the samples and converts it enzymatically to \u03b2 glucose which determines the concentration of fructose present in the sample. Results showed that the concentration of fructose in a liquid sample was able to be quantified using the fluorometric assay. Data showed fructose has a high concentration in semen. It was determined fructose concentrations could be quantified using dried samples on cotton swabs. If this method of identifying semen is found to be viable it will benefit sexual assault casework. to stop the progression of keratoconus, an eye disease that affects the cornea's structure and results in vision loss. The typical treatment plan includes UV-A light and riboflavin to stiffen the cornea, and it takes around 60 to 120 minutes. There are two types of CXL pathways, with Type-II CXL oxygen. Naturally, the dissolved oxygen is limited in the cornea; therefore, limiting the effect from Type-II CXL. To reduce the overall treatment time while maintaining efficacy, we propose to improve the Type-II CXL contribution by introducing dissolved oxygen during the treatment. In this study, we assess the enhancement of the cornea's mechanical properties with oxygen-assisted CXL (O2CXL). Overall, the O2CXL showed a significant increase in biomechanical enhancement compared to the standard CXL. Such enhancement could be attributed to the supplied oxygen, which prolonged the Type-II CXL; thus, improving its stiffening effect. O2CXL should be further investigated to optimize the current CXL procedure, such as reducing the overall treatment time. Currently, synthetic opioids including fentanyl analogs are the leading cause of overdose deaths in the United States.1 New fentanyl analogs are being made regularly and are used to avoid classification as illegal, policy restrictions on manufacturing, and/or detection in standard drug tests.2 This causes the need for quick and efficient drug detection methods for fentanyl analogs in various matrices. Oral fluid is an advantageous matrix because it is easy, cost-effective and requires noninvasive sample collection.3 In this study, a rapid LC/MS/MS method was developed and validated for analyzing expectorated oral fluid samples for 23 fentanyl analogs. Samples were prepared by phospholipid depletion and protein precipitation using 200 microliters of either whole blood or oral fluid and 1% acetic acid in acetonitrile. Separations were completed using an Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 (2.1x100 mm) with a Vanquish\u2122 Ultra High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) System. Gradient elution was performed with 0.1% formic acid in water and acetonitrile. Identification and quantitation were conducted with a TSQ Endura\u2122 Triple Quadrupole -Mass",
