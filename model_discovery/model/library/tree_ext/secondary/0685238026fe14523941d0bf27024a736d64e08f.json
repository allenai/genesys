    "title": "A Theory of the Term Structure of Interest Rates Under Non-expected Intertemporal Preferences",
    "abstract": "This paper presents general equilibrium term structure models under a non-expected lntertemporal utdity funchon, in which two disparate preference elements - lntertemporal subshtuhon and risk aversion are disentangled. One major finding is that in a nsk averse produchon economy, bond prices are independent of intertemporal substitution and thus separating the two preference components becomes totally irrelevant. The models produce several other results that are contrasted with those found in the exlstmg literature.",
