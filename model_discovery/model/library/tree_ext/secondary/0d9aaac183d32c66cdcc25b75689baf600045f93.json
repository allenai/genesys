Van Dyke (jvandyke@haskins.yale.edu) Haskins Laboratories, 300 George Street New Haven, CT 06511 USA Abstract This paper explores variability in individual strategies of pro- cessing morphologically complex words. We examined the eye-movement record that 71 readers showed during reading of suffixed words (truck+er): the readers also took part in a bat- tery of 17 skill tests, which allowed for a fine-grained charac- terization of their verbal abilities. Statistical analyses revealed that an individual\u2019s ability to segment words as well as his or her level of reading comprehension shifted the balance be- tween recognition of a complex word as a whole and its recog- nition via decomposed morphemes. Effects of whole-word fre- quency and base morpheme frequency were observed in both good and poor readers, yet their qualitative nature varied by skill. Good readers suffered from lexical competition between whole words (trucker) and base morphemes (truck), while poor readers received a recognition boost from base words. We dis- cuss these interactive patterns in the context of computational models of morphological processing and argue that readers strategically adjust weights of different sources of morpholog- ical information, depending on the quality of the lexical repre- sentation for both the complex words and their morphemes. Keywords: word recognition; morphological processing; in- dividual differences; computational models; eye-movements Introduction There is a growing consensus in word recognition research that human comprehenders simultaneously access multiple sources of morphological information: lexical forms of whole complex words (trucker), their morphemes (truck, -er), and their morphological families (trucking, truckload, firetruck). Prior work has extensively explored the link between formal, semantic and contextual properties of words that affect the degree of engagement of the different sources of probabilistic information (distributional, semantic, syntactic, phonological and other) in lexical access of complex words (e.g., Bertram, Pollatsek, & Hy\u00a8on\u00a8a, 2004). Evidence points to a process- ing system in which higher-frequency, shorter or semanti- cally opaque complex words tend to rely more on full-form representations, while words with higher-frequency, larger- family, or otherwise easily identifiable morphemes are pref- erentially recognized via decomposed morphemes (e.g., the dual-route model of Baayen, Dijkstra & Schreuder, 1997). Recognition via full-forms is suggested by effects of whole- word properties (such as frequency of occurrence or length) and morpheme-based processing is diagnosed by effects of morphemic properties (morpheme frequency, family size, af- fix productivity or length, etc.). The parallel engagement of processing routes shows up in the interactions of whole- word and morphemic properties, attested in behavioral mea- sures throughout the entire time-course of word recognition. The interactions reported thus far in the literature indicate competition between information sources, such that whole- word frequency effects are weakened in words with higher- frequency or otherwise salient morphemes (see Kuperman, Bertram, & Baayen, 2010, and references therein). The par- allel operation of multiple access routes, as well as trade-offs between the routes, are at the core of several computational models of morphological processing: for example, trade- offs were implemented as simultaneous activation and lexical competition of words that match the perceptual input (Baayen & Schreuder, 2000), or as the simultaneous adjustment of weight coefficients for the amounts of information associated with distributional properties of complex words, their mor- phemes and morphological families (Kuperman, Bertram, & Baayen, 2008). Importantly, these models have developed for the most part independently of a large body of reading research that sug- gests that efficient word recognition is not simply about lin- guistic characteristics of words, but rather about linguistic characteristics of words as learned by particular individuals (but see Reichle & Perfetti, 2003). While some subjective as- pects of lexical variables have been investigated earlier (e.g., Balota et al., 2004 and references therein), relatively little is known about how engagement of the information sources contributing to recognizing complex words is modulated by the skill-level of individual readers (see however Carlisle & Katz, 2006 for morphological processing in children). The present study aims at characterizing variability in processing strategies that readers of different skill levels employ when reading complex word structures. As a diagnostic, we use the interactions between individual scores in skill tests that tap into particular verbal abilities (e.g., word decoding, word seg- mentation, reading comprehension) on the one hand, and the distributional properties of the full-form of complex words and their component morphemes, on the other hand. We take as a guiding assumption the idea advocated iby the Lexical Quality hypothesis (Perfetti, 2007) that individu- als differ in the average quality of their word representations. High quality lexical representations are characterized by i) highly automatic associations of precise orthographic forms to the phonological representations learned during oral lan- guage acquisition; ii) automatic associations of these same phonological representations to semantic representations; and iii) a highly elaborated and redundantly specified semantics, encompassing the full variety of syntactic and semantic con-",
