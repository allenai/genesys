    "title": "Using TF-IDF to Determine Word Relevance in Document Queries",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we examine the results of applying Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to determine what words in a corpus of documents might be more favorable to use in a query. As the term implies, TF-IDF calculates values for each word in a document through an inverse proportion of the frequency of the word in a particular document to the percentage of documents the word appears in. Words with high TF-IDF numbers imply a strong relationship with the document they appear in, suggesting that if that word were to appear in a query, the document could be of interest to the user. We provide evidence that this simple algorithm efficiently categorizes relevant words that can enhance query retrieval.",
