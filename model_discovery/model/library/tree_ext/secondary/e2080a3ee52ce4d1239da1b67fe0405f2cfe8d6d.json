    "title": "Legal Docket Classification: Where Machine Learning Stumbles",
    "abstract": "We investigate the problem of binary text classification in the domain of legal docket entries. This work presents an illustrative instance of a domain-specific problem where the state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) classifiers such as SVMs are inadequate. Our investigation into the reasons for the failure of these classifiers revealed two types of prominent errors which we call conjunctive and disjunctive errors. We developed simple heuristics to address one of these error types and improve the performance of the SVMs. Based on the intuition gained from our experiments, we also developed a simple propositional logic based classifier using hand-labeled features, that addresses both types of errors simultaneously. We show that this new, but simple, approach outperforms all existing state-of-the-art ML models, with statistically significant gains. We hope this work serves as a motivating example of the need to build more expressive classifiers beyond the standard model classes, and to address text classification problems in such non-traditional domains.",
