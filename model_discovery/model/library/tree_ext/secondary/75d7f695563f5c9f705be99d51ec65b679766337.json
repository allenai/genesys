    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to complex classification of heart abnormalities registered by electrocardiogram signals. It uses a combined approach of a Fast Fourier Technique for signal filtering and R-peaks detection and heart rate extraction, followed by signal modelling and classification by neural network based on recording of ECG. Obtained information is processed together for a complex evaluation of the signal in time.",
