    "title": "Multiresolution Signal Decomposition: Transforms, Subbands, and Wavelets",
    "abstract": "From the Publisher: \nMultiresolution Signal Composition: Transforms, Subbands, and Wavelets, Second Edition is the first book to give a unified and coherent exposition of orthogonal signal decomposition techniques. Advances in the field of electrical engineering/computer science have occurred since the first edition was published in 1992. This second edition addresses new developments in applications-related chapters, especially in Chapter 4, \"Filterbrook Families: Design and Performance,\" which is greatly expanded. Also included are the most recent applications of orthogonal transforms in digital communications and multimedia. \nMultiresolution Signal Composition: Transforms, Subbands, and Wavelets, Second Edition is intended for graduate students and research and development practitioners engaged in signal processing applications in voice and image processing, multimedia, and telecommunications.",
