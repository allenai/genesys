    "title": "Associative memory",
    "abstract": "This section considers how neural networks can be used as associative memory devices. It first describes what an associative memory is, and then moves on to describe associative memories based on feedforward neural networks and associative memories based on recurrent networks. The section also describes associative memory systems based on cognitive models. It also highlights the ability of neural-network-based systems to deal with uncertain data as compared with conventional associative memory systems.",
