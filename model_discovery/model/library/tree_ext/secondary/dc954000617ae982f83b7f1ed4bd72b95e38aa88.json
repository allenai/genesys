    "abstract": "The focus of DUC 2005 was on developing new evaluation methods that take into account variation in content in human-authored summaries. Therefore, DUC 2005 had a single user-oriented, question-focused summarization task that allowed the community to put some time and effort into helping with the new evaluation framework. The summarization task was to synthesize from a set of 25-50 documents a well-organized, fluent answer to a complex question. The relatively generous allowance of 250 words for each answer reveals how difficult it is for current summarization systems to produce fluent multi-document summaries.",
