    "title": "Geometry for q-exponential families",
    "abstract": "Geometry for q-exponential families is studied in this paper. A q-exponential family is a set of probability distributions, which is a natural generalization of the standard exponential family. A q-exponential family has information geometric structure and a dually flat structure. To describe these relations, generalized conformal structures for statistical manifolds are studied in this paper. As an application of geometry for q-exponential families, a geometric generalization of statistical inference is also studied.",
