    "abstract": "This paper presents the Seventh Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE-7) challenge. This year\u2019s challenge replicated the exercise proposed in RTE-6, consisting of a Main Task, in which Textual Entailment is performed on a real corpus in the Update Summarization scenario; a Main subtask aimed at detecting novel information; and a KBP Validation Task, in which RTE systems had to validate the output of systems participating in the KBP Slot Filling Task. Thirteen teams participated in the Main Task (submitting 33 runs) and 5 in the Novelty Detection Subtask (submitting 13 runs). The KBP Validation Task was undertaken by 2 participants which submitted 5 runs. The ablation test experiment, introduced in RTE-5 to evaluate the impact of knowledge resources used by the systems participating in the Main Task and extended also to tools in RTE-6, was also repeated in RTE-7.",
