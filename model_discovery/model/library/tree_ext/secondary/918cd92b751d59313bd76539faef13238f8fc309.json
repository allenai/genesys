    "abstract": "in the noncommutative indeterminates X1, , Xm. The main result of this paper is briefly as follows: If 0(oa) =0() for two irreducible piecewise C' and continuous curves oa and f, then f can be obtained from oa by translation. We begin with considering curves in a differentiable manifold 9S. For the purpose of proving the main result, one may replace the manifold SR by the affine space 9jm in all arguments. The main result relies heavily upon Fundamental Lemma which asserts that, for each irreducible curve oa, there is some iterated integral not vanishing along oa. This lemma is indeed the center of this paper, and the majority of the definitions and lemmas in ??1-3 are aimed at its proof. If wi, * * *, wm are differentials in a differentiable manifold 9N, then we may define for a curve oa in 91, the formal power series",
