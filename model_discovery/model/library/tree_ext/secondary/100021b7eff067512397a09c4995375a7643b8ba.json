    "title": "Logistic-normal distributions:Some properties and uses",
    "abstract": "SUMMARY The logistic transformation applied to a ^-dimensional normal distribution produces a distribution over the d-dimensional simplex which can sensibly be termed a logistic-norma l distribution. Such distributions, implicitly used in a number of recent applications, are here given a formal identity and some useful properties are recorded. A main aim is to extend the area of application from the restricted role as a substitute for the Dirichlet conjugate prior class in the analysis of multinomial and contingency table data to the direct statistical description and analysis of compositional and probabilistic data.",
