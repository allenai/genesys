    "title": "The working set model for program behavior",
    "abstract": "Probably the most basic reason behind the absence of a general treatment of resource allocation in modern computer systems is an adequate model for program behavior. In this paper a new model, the \u201cworking set model,\u201d is developed. The working set of pages associated with a process, defined to be the collection of its most recently used pages, provides knowledge vital to the dynamic management of paged memories. \u201cProcess\u201d and \u201cworking set\u201d are shown to be manifestations of the same ongoing computational activity; then \u201cprocessor demand\u201d and \u201cmemory demand\u201d are defined; and resource allocation is formulated as the problem of balancing demands against available equipment.",
