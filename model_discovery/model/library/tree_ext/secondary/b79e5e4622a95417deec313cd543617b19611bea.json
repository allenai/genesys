    "title": "Deep Learning using Rectified Linear Units (ReLU)",
    "abstract": "We introduce the use of rectified linear units (ReLU) as the classification function in a deep neural network (DNN). Conventionally, ReLU is used as an activation function in DNNs, with Softmax function as their classification function. However, there have been several studies on using a classification function other than Softmax, and this study is an addition to those. We accomplish this by taking the activation of the penultimate layer $h_{n - 1}$ in a neural network, then multiply it by weight parameters $\\theta$ to get the raw scores $o_{i}$. Afterwards, we threshold the raw scores $o_{i}$ by $0$, i.e. $f(o) = \\max(0, o_{i})$, where $f(o)$ is the ReLU function. We provide class predictions $\\hat{y}$ through argmax function, i.e. argmax $f(x)$.",
