    "abstract": "The problems of self-learning are discussed, and a general method of solving these problems is described. Performance criteria for evaluating the quality of self-learning are given, and the algorithms for self-learning which minimize the proposed performance criteria are found. The ideas of optimal algorithms are introduced. In the conclusion, the special nature of the problems of self-learning is discussed.",
