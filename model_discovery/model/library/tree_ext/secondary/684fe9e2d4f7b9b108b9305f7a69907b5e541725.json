    "abstract": "We investigate methods for combining multiple selfsupervised tasks\u2014i.e., supervised tasks where data can be collected without manual labeling\u2014in order to train a single visual representation. First, we provide an apples-toapples comparison of four different self-supervised tasks using the very deep ResNet-101 architecture. We then combine tasks to jointly train a network. We also explore lasso regularization to encourage the network to factorize the information in its representation, and methods for \u201charmonizing\u201d network inputs in order to learn a more unified representation. We evaluate all methods on ImageNet classification, PASCAL VOC detection, and NYU depth prediction. Our results show that deeper networks work better, and that combining tasks\u2014even via a na\u00a8\u00fdve multihead architecture\u2014always improves performance. Our best joint network nearly matches the PASCAL performance of a model pre-trained on ImageNet classification, and matches the ImageNet network on NYU depth prediction.",
