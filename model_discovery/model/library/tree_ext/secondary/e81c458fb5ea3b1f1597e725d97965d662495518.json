    "title": "Confidence through Attention",
    "abstract": "Attention distributions of the generated translations are a useful bi-product of attention-based recurrent neural network translation models and can be treated as soft alignments between the input and output tokens. In this work, we use attention distributions as a confidence metric for output translations. We present two strategies of using the attention distributions: filtering out bad translations from a large back-translated corpus, and selecting the best translation in a hybrid setup of two different translation systems. While manual evaluation indicated only a weak correlation between our confidence score and human judgments, the use-cases showed improvements of up to 2.22 BLEU points for filtering and 0.99 points for hybrid translation, tested on English German and English Latvian translation.",
