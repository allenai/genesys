    "title": "A Bayesian Approach to in Silico Blood-Brain Barrier Penetration Modeling",
    "abstract": "The human blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a membrane that protects the central nervous system (CNS) by restricting the passage of solutes. The development of any new drug must take into account its existence whether for designing new molecules that target components of the CNS or, on the other hand, to find new substances that should not penetrate the barrier. Several studies in the literature have attempted to predict BBB penetration, so far with limited success and few, if any, application to real world drug discovery and development programs. Part of the reason is due to the fact that only about 2% of small molecules can cross the BBB, and the available data sets are not representative of that reality, being generally biased with an over-representation of molecules that show an ability to permeate the BBB (BBB positives). To circumvent this limitation, the current study aims to devise and use a new approach based on Bayesian statistics, coupled with state-of-the-art machine learning methods to produce a robust model capable of being applied in real-world drug research scenarios. The data set used, gathered from the literature, totals 1970 curated molecules, one of the largest for similar studies. Random Forests and Support Vector Machines were tested in various configurations against several chemical descriptor set combinations. Models were tested in a 5-fold cross-validation process, and the best one tested over an independent validation set. The best fitted model produced an overall accuracy of 95%, with a mean square contingency coefficient (\u03d5) of 0.74, and showing an overall capacity for predicting BBB positives of 83% and 96% for determining BBB negatives. This model was adapted into a Web based tool made available for the whole community at http://b3pp.lasige.di.fc.ul.pt.",
