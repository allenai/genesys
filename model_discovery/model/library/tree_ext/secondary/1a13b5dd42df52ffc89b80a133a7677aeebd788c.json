    "title": "GEINet: View-invariant gait recognition using a convolutional neural network",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a method of gait recognition using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Inspired by the great successes of CNNs in image recognition tasks, we feed in the most prevalent image-based gait representation, that is, the gait energy image (GEI), as an input to a CNN designed for gait recognition called GEINet. More specifically, GEINet is composed of two sequential triplets of convolution, pooling, and normalization layers, and two subsequent fully connected layers, which output a set of similarities to individual training subjects. We conducted experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of cross-view gait recognition in both cooperative and uncooperative settings using the OU-ISIR large population dataset. As a result, we confirmed that the proposed method significantly outperformed state-of-the-art approaches, in particular in verification scenarios.",
