    "sedd-1": "Crucially, standard diffusion models rely on the well-established theory of score matching, but efforts to generalize this to discrete structures have not yielded the same empirical gains. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing score entropy, a novel loss that naturally extends score matching to discrete spaces, integrates seamlessly to build discrete diffusion models, and significantly boosts performance. Experimentally, we test our Score Entropy Discrete Diffusion models (SEDD) on standard language modeling tasks. For comparable model sizes, SEDD beats existing language diffusion paradigms (reducing perplexity by $25-75 \\%$ ) and is competitive with autoregressive models, in particular outperforming GPT-2. Furthermore, compared to autoregressive mdoels, SEDD generates faithful text without requiring distribution annealing techniques like temperature scaling (around 6$8 \\times$ better generative perplexity than un-annealed GPT-2), can trade compute and quality (similar quality with $32 \\times$ fewer network evaluations), and enables controllable infilling (matching nucleus sampling quality while enabling other strategies besides left to right prompting). ## 1. Introduction\n\nMany recent advances in deep learning have centered around generative modeling. Here, a model learns how to generate novel samples from unstructured data. With the powerful capabilities of modern neural networks, these \"generative Al\" systems have developed unparalleled capabilities, such as creating images given only text (Ramesh et al., 2022) and answering complex questions (Brown et al., 2020). [^0]The crucial part for any deep generative model is the probabilistic modeling technique. For discrete data such as natural language, autoregressive modeling (Yule, 1971)arguably the simplest modeling type since it derives from the probabilistic chain rule-has remained the only competitive method for decades. Although modern autoregressive transformers have produced stunning results (Vaswani et al., 2017; Radford et al., 2019), there are limits. For example, the sequential sampling of tokens is slow, hard to control, and often degrades without distribution annealing techniques like nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2019). To alleviate these issues, researchers have sought alternative approaches to generating text data. In particular, inspired by their success in the image domain, many works have extended diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021c) to language domains (Li et al., 2022; Austin et al., 2021). Yet, despite considerable effort, no such approach yet rivals autoregressive modeling, as they are not competitive on likelihoods, are slower to sample from, and do not generate comparable samples without resorting to heavy annealing and empirical alterations. In our work, we challenge the longstanding dominance of autoregressive models by introducing Score Entropy Discrete Diffusion models (SEDD). SEDD parameterizes a reverse discrete diffusion process using the ratios of the data distribution. These are learned using score entropy, a novel loss that is analogous to score matching for standard diffusion models (Hyv\u00e4rinen, 2005; Song \\& Ermon, 2019) and results in several empirical benefits:\n\n1. On core language modeling tasks, SEDD outperforms all existing language diffusion models (Li et al., 2022; Austin et al., 2021; Gulrajani \\& Hashimoto, 2023; He et al., 2022) by large margins and is competitive with autoregressive models of the same size (beating GPT-2 on its zero-shot perplexity tasks (Radford et al., 2019)). 2. SEDD generates high quality unconditional samples and enables one to naturally trade off compute for quality. When measuring the generative perplexity (given by large models) of unconditional and un-annealed samples from similarly sized models, SEDD beats\n\nWe open source our code at github.com/louaaron/ScoreEntropy-Discrete-Diffusion\n\nGPT- 2 by $6-8 \\times$ and can match performance using $32 \\times$ fewer function evaluations.",
    "sedd-2": "3. By directly parameterizing probability ratios, SEDD is highly controllable. In particular, one can prompt SEDD from arbitrary positions without specialized training. For both standard (left to right) and infilling, SEDD outperforms language diffusion models and is comparable with autoregressive models with nucleus sampling (as measured by MAUVE score (Pillutla et al., 2021)).",
    "sedd-3": "## 2. Preliminaries\n\n### 2.1. Discrete Diffusion Processes\n\nWe will be modeling probability distributions over a finite support $\\mathcal{X}=\\{1, \\ldots, N\\}$. As the support is discrete, note that our probability distributions can be represented by probability mass vectors $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ that are positive and sum to 1. To define a discrete diffusion process, we evolve a family of distributions $p_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ according to the a continuous time Markov process given by a linear ordinary differential equation (Campbell et al., 2022; Anderson, 2012):\n\n$$\n\\frac{d p_{t}}{d t}=Q_{t} p_{t} \\quad p_{0} \\approx p_{\\text {data }}\n$$\n\nHere, $Q_{t}$ are the diffusion matrices $\\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$ and have nonnegative non-diagonal entries and columns which sum to zero (so that the rate $\\frac{d p_{t}}{d t}$ sums to 0 , meaning $p_{t}$ does not gain or lose total mass).",
    "sedd-4": "Generally, $Q_{t}$ are simple (e.g. a simple scalar factor $\\left.Q_{t}=\\sigma(t) Q\\right)$ so $p_{t}$ approaches a limiting distribution $p_{\\text {base }}$ as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$. One can simulate this process by taking small $\\Delta t$ Euler steps and randomly sampling the resulting transitions. In particular, the samples are defined by transition densities which come from the columns of $Q_{t}$ :\n\n$$\np\\left(x_{t+\\Delta t}=y \\mid x_{t}=x\\right)=\\delta_{x y}+Q_{t}(y, x) \\Delta t+O\\left(\\Delta t^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nFinally, this process has a well known reversal (Kelly, 1980; Sun et al., 2023) given by another diffusion matrix $\\bar{Q}_{t}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{d p_{T-t}}{d t}=\\bar{Q}_{T-t} p_{T-t} & \\bar{Q}_{t}(y, x)=\\frac{p_{t}(y)}{p_{t}(x)} Q_{t}(x, y) \\\\\n& \\bar{Q}_{t}(x, x)=-\\sum_{y \\neq x} \\bar{Q}_{t}(y, x)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis reverse process is analogous to the time reversal for typical diffusion processes on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, with the ratios $\\frac{p_{t}(y)}{p_{t}(x)}$ (which are collectively known as the concrete score (Meng et al., 2022)) generalizing the typical score function $\\nabla_{x} \\log p_{t}$ (Song \\& Ermon, 2019) ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^1]\n### 2.2. Discrete Diffusion Models\n\nThe goal of a discrete diffusion model is to construct the aforementioned reverse process by learning the ratios $\\frac{p_{t}(y)}{p_{t}(x)}$. Unlike the continuous diffusion case, which has settled around (up to minor scaling variations) the theoretical framework given by score matching (Hyv\u00e4rinen, 2005), there currently exist many competing methods for learning discrete diffusion models. In particular, these tend to produce mixed empirical results, which spurs the need for a reexamination. Mean Prediction. Instead of directly parameterizing the ratios $\\frac{p_{t}(y)}{p_{t}(x)}$, Austin et al. (2021); Campbell et al. (2022) instead follow a strategy of Ho et al. (2020) to learn the reverse density $p_{0 \\mid t}$. This actually recovers the ratios $\\frac{p_{t}(y)}{p_{t}(x)}$ in a roundabout way (as shown in our Theorem 4.2), but comes with several drawbacks. First, learning $p_{0 \\mid t}$ is inherently harder since it is a density (as opposed to a general value). Furthermore, the objective breaks down in continuous time and must be approximated (Campbell et al., 2022). As a result, this framework largely underperforms empirically. Ratio Matching. Originally introduced in Hyv\u00e4rinen (2007) and augmented in Sun et al. (2023), ratio matching learns the marginal probabilities of each dimension with maximum likelihood training. However, the resulting setup departs from standard score matching and requires specialized and expensive network architectures (Chen \\& Duvenaud, 2019). As such, this tends to perform worse than mean prediction. Concrete Score Matching. Meng et al. (2022) generalizes the standard Fisher divergence in score matching, learning $s_{\\theta}(x, t) \\approx\\left[\\frac{p_{t}(y)}{p_{t}(x)}\\right]_{y \\neq x}$ with concrete score matching:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{CSM}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_{t}}\\left[\\sum_{y \\neq x}\\left(s_{\\theta}\\left(x_{t}, t\\right)_{y}-\\frac{p_{t}(y)}{p_{t}(x)}\\right)^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nUnfortunately, the $\\ell^{2}$ loss is incompatible with the fact that $\\frac{p_{t}(y)}{p_{t}(x)}$ must be positive. In particular, this does not sufficiently penalize negative or zero values, leading to divergent behavior. Although theoretically promising, Concrete Score Matching struggles (as seen in Appendix D). ## 3. Score Entropy Discrete Diffusion Models\n\nIn this section, we introduce score entropy. Similar to concrete score matching, we learn the collected concrete score $s_{\\theta}(x, t) \\approx\\left[\\frac{p_{t}(y)}{p_{t}(x)}\\right]_{y \\neq x}\\left(s_{\\theta}: \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{\\mid \\mathcal{X}} \\mid\\right)$. We design the score entropy loss to incorporate the fact that these ratios are positive and evolve under a discrete diffusion. [^2]Definition 3.1. The score entropy $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{SE}}$ for a distribution $p$, weights $w_{x y} \\geq 0$ and a score network $s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}$ is\n$\\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p}\\left[\\sum_{y \\neq x} w_{x y}\\left(s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}-\\frac{p(y)}{p(x)} \\log s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}+K\\left(\\frac{p(y)}{p(x)}\\right)\\right)\\right]$\nwhere $K(a)=a(\\log a-1)$ is a normalizing constant function that ensures that $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{SE}} \\geq 0$. Remark. Instead of building off of Fisher divergences, score entropy builds off of the Bregman divergence $D_{F}\\left(s(x)_{y}, \\frac{p(y)}{p(x)}\\right)$ when $F=-\\log$ is the convex function. As such, score entropy is non-negative, symmetric, and convex. It also generalizes standard cross entropy to general positive values (instead of simplex-valued probabilities), inspiring the name. The weights $w_{x y}$ are used primarily when combining score entropy with diffusion models. While this expression is more complex than the standard score matching variants, it satisfies several desiderata for a discrete diffusion training objective:\n\n### 3.1. Score Entropy Properties\n\nFirst, score entropy is a suitable loss function that recovers the ground truth concrete score. Proposition 3.2 (Consistency of Score Entropy). Suppose $p$ is fully supported and $w_{x y}>0$. As the number of samples and model capacity approaches $\\infty$, the optimal $\\theta^{*}$ that minimizes Equation 5 satisfies $s_{\\theta^{*}}(x)_{y}=\\frac{p(y)}{p(x)}$ for all pairs $x, y$ Furthermore, $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{SE}}$ will be 0 at $\\theta^{*}$. Second, score entropy directly improves upon concrete score matching by rescaling problematic gradients. For the weights $w_{x y}=1, \\nabla_{s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}} \\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{SE}}=\\frac{1}{s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}} \\nabla_{s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}} \\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{CSM}}$, so the gradient signals for each pair $(x, y)$ are scaled by a factor of $s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}$ as a normalization component. As such, this forms a natural log-barrier which keeps our $s_{\\theta} \\geq 0$. Third, similar to concrete score matching, score entropy can be made computationally tractable by removing the unknown $\\frac{p(y)}{p(x)}$ term. There are two alternative forms, the first of which is analogous to the implicit score matching loss (Hyv\u00e4rinen, 2005):\nProposition 3.3 (Implicit Score Entropy). $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{SE}}$ is equal up to a constant independent of $\\theta$ to the implicit score entropy\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{ISE}}=\\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p}\\left[\\sum_{y \\neq x} w_{x y} s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}-w_{y x} \\log s_{\\theta}(y)_{x}\\right]\n$$\n\nUnfortunately, a Monte Carlo estimate would require sampling an $x$ and evaluating $s_{\\theta}(y)_{x}$ for all other $y$. For high dimensions, this is intractable, which means we have to sample $y$ uniformly, but this introduces additional variance analogous to that introduced by the Hutchinson trace estimator (Hutchinson, 1989) for sliced score matching (Song et al., 2019). As a result, implicit score entropy is impractical for large-scale tasks. Instead, we work a denoising score matching loss (Vincent, 2011) variant of score entropy:\nTheorem 3.4 (Denoising Score Entropy). Suppose p is a perturbation of a base density $p_{0}$ by a transition kernel $p(\\cdot \\mid \\cdot)$, ie $p(x)=\\sum_{x_{0}} p\\left(x \\mid x_{0}\\right) p_{0}\\left(x_{0}\\right)$. The score entropy $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{SE}}$ is equivalent (up to a constant independent of $\\theta$ ) to the denoising score entropy $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {DSE }}$ is\n\n$$\n\\underset{\\substack{x_{0} \\\\ x \\sim p\\left(\\cdot \\mid x_{0}\\right)}}{\\mathbb{E}}\\left[\\sum_{y \\neq x} w_{x y}\\left(s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}-\\frac{p\\left(y \\mid x_{0}\\right)}{p\\left(x \\mid x_{0}\\right)} \\log s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\n$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {DSE }}$ is scalable since Monte Carlo sampling only requires the evaluation of one $s_{\\theta}(x)$, which gives us all $s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}$, and the variance introduced by $x_{0}$ is manageable. Additionally, it is particularly appealing for discrete diffusion since the intermediate $p_{t}$ are all perturbations of the base density $p_{0}$ (resulting from Equations 1, 2), enabling us to train with $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {DSE }}$ using the diffusion transition densities $p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(\\cdot \\mid x_{0}\\right)$ (which we can make tractable). ### 3.2. Likelihood Bound For Score Entropy Discrete Diffusion\n\nFourth, the score entropy can be used to define an ELBO for likelihood-based training and evaluation. Definition 3.5. For our time dependent score network $s_{\\theta}(\\cdot, t)$, the parameterized reverse matrix is $\\bar{Q}_{t}^{\\theta}(y, x)=$ $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}s_{\\theta}(x, t)_{y} Q_{t}(x, y) & x \\neq y \\\\ -\\sum_{z \\neq x} \\bar{Q}_{t}^{\\theta}(z, y) & x=y\\end{array}\\right.$ found by replacing the ground truth scores in Equation 3. Our parameterized densities $p_{t}^{\\theta}$ thus satisfy the following differential equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d p_{T-t}^{\\theta}}{d t}=\\bar{Q}_{T-t}^{\\theta} p_{T-t}^{\\theta} \\quad p_{T}^{\\theta}=p_{\\text {base }} \\approx p_{T}\n$$\n\nThe log likelihood of data points can be bounded using an ELBO based off of Dynkin's formula (Hanson, 2007), which was derived for discrete diffusion models in Campbell et al. (2022). Interestingly, this takes the form of our denoising score entropy loss weighted by the forward diffusion:\nTheorem 3.6 (Likelihood Training and Evaluation). For the diffusion and forward probabilities defined above,\n\n$$\n-\\log p_{0}^{\\theta}\\left(x_{0}\\right) \\leq \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {DWDSE }}\\left(x_{0}\\right)+D_{K L}\\left(p_{T \\mid 0}\\left(\\cdot \\mid x_{0}\\right) \\| p_{\\text {base }}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {DWDSE }}\\left(x_{0}\\right)$ is the diffusion weighted denoising score entropy for data point $x_{0}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\int_{0}^{T} \\mathbb{E}_{x_{t} \\sim p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(\\mid x_{0}\\right)} \\sum_{y \\neq x_{t}} Q_{t}\\left(x_{t}, y\\right)\\left(s_{\\theta}\\left(x_{t}, t\\right)_{y}-\\right. \\\\\n\\left.\\frac{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(y \\mid x_{0}\\right)}{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(x_{t} \\mid x_{0}\\right)} \\log s_{\\theta}\\left(x_{t}, t\\right)_{y}+K\\left(\\frac{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(y \\mid x_{0}\\right)}{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(x_{t} \\mid x_{0}\\right)}\\right)\\right) d t\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nCrucially, this result allows us to directly models based on their likelihood values (and the related perplexity scores), the core metric for language modeling tasks.",
    "sedd-5": "In particular, we can train and evaluate an upper bound. Remark. The DWDSE (and the implicit version) can be derived from the general framework of Benton et al. (2022) assuming a concrete score parameterization. In particular, the implicit version coincides with the likelihood loss introduced in Campbell et al.",
    "sedd-6": "(2022). ### 3.3. Practical Implementation\n\nFifth, score entropy can be scaled to high dimensional tasks. In practice, our state factorizes into sequences $\\mathcal{X}=$ $\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}^{d}$ to form sequences $\\mathbf{x}=x^{1} \\ldots x^{d}$ (e.g. sequences of tokens or image pixel values). As a general $Q_{t}$ would be of exponential size, we instead choose a sparse structured matrix that perturbs tokens independently with a matrix $Q_{t}^{\\mathrm{tok}}$. In particular, the nonzero entries of $Q_{t}$ are given by\n\n$$\nQ_{t}\\left(x^{1} \\ldots x^{i} \\ldots x^{d}, x^{1} \\ldots \\widehat{x}^{i} \\ldots x^{d}\\right)=Q_{t}^{\\mathrm{tok}}\\left(x^{i}, \\widehat{x}^{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nSince $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {DWDSE }}$ weights the loss by $Q_{t}(x, y)$, this token level transition $Q_{t}$ renders most ratios irrelevant. In particular, we only need to model all ratios between sequences with Hamming distnace 1 , so we can build our score network $s_{\\theta}(\\cdot, t):\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times n}$ as a seq-to-seq map:\n\n$$\n\\left(s_{\\theta}\\left(x^{1} \\ldots x^{i} \\ldots x^{d}, t\\right)\\right)_{i, \\widehat{x}^{i}} \\approx \\frac{p_{t}\\left(x^{1} \\ldots \\widehat{x}^{i} \\ldots x^{d}\\right)}{p_{t}\\left(x^{1} \\ldots x^{i} \\ldots x^{d}\\right)}\n$$\n\nTo fully compute $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {DWDSE }}$, we just need to calculate the forward transition $p_{t \\mid 0}^{\\text {seq }}(\\cdot \\mid \\cdot)$. Luckily, this decomposes as each token is perturbed independently:\n\n$$\np_{t \\mid 0}^{\\mathrm{seq}}(\\widehat{\\mathbf{x}} \\mid \\mathbf{x})=\\prod_{i=1}^{d} p_{t \\mid 0}^{\\mathrm{tok}}\\left(\\widehat{x}^{i} \\mid x^{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor each $p_{t \\mid 0}^{\\text {tok }}(\\cdot \\mid \\cdot)$, we employ the previously discussed strategy and set $Q_{t}^{\\mathrm{tok}}=\\sigma(t) Q^{\\mathrm{tok}}$ for a noise level $\\sigma$ and a fixed transition $Q^{\\text {tok }}$. This avoids numerical integration as, if we define $\\bar{\\sigma}(t)$ as the cumulative noise $\\int_{0}^{t} \\sigma(s) d s$, we have:\n\n$$\np_{t \\mid 0}^{\\mathrm{tok}}(\\cdot \\mid x)=x \\text {-th column of } \\exp \\left(\\bar{\\sigma}(t) Q^{\\text {tok }}\\right)\n$$\n\nThere are some practical consequences that render most $Q^{\\text {tok }}$ unusable for large scale experiments (e.g. for GPT-2 tasks, $n=50257$ ). In particular, one is not able to store all edge weights $Q_{\\text {tok }}(i, j)$ since this takes around 20 GB of GPU memory and is extremely slow to access. Furthermore, one must be able to compute the columns $\\exp \\left(\\bar{\\sigma}(t) \\cdot Q^{\\text {tok }}\\right)$ to get the transition ratios, but this must avoid matrix-matrix multiplication again can't be stored in memory. To sidestep these issues, we follow prior work (Austin et al., 2021; Campbell et al., 2022) and use two standard matrices with special structures. They arise, respectively, from considering a fully connected graph structure and from introducing a MASK absorbing state (similar to the BERT language modeling paradigm (Devlin et al., 2019)):\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nQ^{\\text {uniform }}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\n1-N & 1 & \\cdots & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1-N & \\cdots & 1 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n1 & 1 & \\cdots & 1-N\n\\end{array}\\right] \\\\\nQ^{\\text {absorb }}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}\n-1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -1 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\cdots & -1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & \\cdots & 1 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nWith such a structured $Q$, one can quickly and cheaply compute all values in $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {DWDSE }}$. As such, our training iteration is about as fast and uses a similar amount of memory as standard autoregressive training.",
    "sedd-7": "In particular, our training algorithm is given in Algorithm 1. ## 4. Simulating Reverse Diffusion with Concrete Scores\n\nGiven our scores $s_{\\theta}$, we now derive various strategies for simulating a path $\\mathbf{x}_{t}=x_{t}^{1} x_{t}^{2} \\ldots x_{t}^{d} \\sim p_{t}$ of the reverse diffusion process. Notably, the additional information that we gain from $s_{\\theta}$ being an approximate ratio of $p_{t}$ can be used to enhance the sampling process. ### 4.1. Time-Reversal Strategies\n\nTo simulate the diffusion in Definition 3.5, one may be tempted to use the Euler strategy from Equation 2. However, as noted in Campbell et al. (2022), this is inefficient because the structure of $Q_{t}^{\\mathrm{seq}}$ only allows one position to be modified per step. Instead, a natural alternative has been to use $\\tau$-leaping (Gillespie, 2001), which performs an Euler step at each position simultaneously. In particular, given a sequence $\\mathrm{x}_{t}$, we construct $\\mathrm{x}_{t-\\Delta t}$ by sampling each token $x_{t-\\Delta t}^{i}$ (independently) from the corresponding probability\n\n$$\n\\delta_{x_{t}^{i}}\\left(x_{t-\\Delta t}^{i}\\right)+\\Delta t Q_{t}^{\\mathrm{tok}}\\left(x_{t}^{i}, x_{t-\\Delta t}^{i}\\right) s_{\\theta}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}, t\\right)_{i, x_{t-\\Delta t}^{i}}\n$$\n\nWhile $\\tau$-leaping is a viable simulation strategy, it is agnostic to fact that our $s_{\\theta}$ approximates the true concrete score. In particular, knowing all $\\frac{p_{t}(y)}{p_{t}(x)}$ enables optimal denoising, analogous to Tweedie's theorem (Efron, 2011):\nTheorem 4.1 (Discrete Tweedie's Theorem). Suppose that $p_{t}$ follows the diffusion $O D E d p_{t}=Q p_{t}$. Then the true denoiser is given by\n$p_{0 \\mid t}\\left(x_{0} \\mid x_{t}\\right)=\\left(\\exp (-t Q)\\left[\\frac{\\left.p_{t}(i)\\right)}{p_{t}\\left(x_{t}\\right)}\\right]_{i=1}^{N}\\right)_{x_{0}} \\exp (t Q)\\left(x_{t}, x_{0}\\right)$\n\nUnfortunately, we do not know all of the ratios (only ratios between Hamming distance 1 sequences). However, we can use this intuition to build a Tweedie denoiser analogue of $\\tau$-leaping. In particular, we replace the token transition probabilities (for $x_{t-\\Delta t}^{i}$ ) with the values\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left(\\exp \\left(-\\sigma_{t}^{\\Delta t} Q\\right) s_{\\theta}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}, t\\right)_{i}\\right)_{x_{t-\\Delta t}^{i}} \\exp \\left(\\sigma_{t}^{\\Delta t} Q\\right)\\left(x_{t}^{i}, x_{t-\\Delta t}^{i}\\right) \\\\\n\\text { where } \\sigma_{t}^{\\Delta t}=(\\bar{\\sigma}(t)-\\bar{\\sigma}(t-\\Delta t))\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThis generalizes the theorem but enforces the tau-leaping independence condition and, in fact, is optimal:\nTheorem 4.2 (Tweedie $\\tau$-leaping). Let $p_{t-\\Delta t \\mid t}^{\\text {tweedie }}\\left(\\mathrm{x}_{t-\\Delta t} \\mid \\mathrm{x}_{t}\\right)$ be the probability of the token update rule defined by Equation 19. Assuming $s_{\\theta}$ is learned perfectly, this minimizes the $K L$ divergence with the true reverse $p_{t-\\Delta t \\mid t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t-\\Delta t} \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right)$ for all $\\tau$-leaping strategies (i.e. token transitions are applied independently and simultaneously). These simulation algorithms are unified in Algorithm 2. ### 4.2. Arbitrary Prompting and Infilling\n\nOur concrete score can also be used to enable greater control over the generative process. This is due to the fact that we are modeling a function of the probability, allowing us to include conditional information through Bayes' rule. In particular, we consider the infilling problem\n\n$$\np_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}^{\\Omega} \\mid \\mathbf{x}^{\\bar{\\Omega}}=\\mathbf{y}\\right) \\quad \\Omega \\text { unfilled indices } \\quad \\bar{\\Omega} \\text { filled }\n$$\n\nAs an example, a standard autoregressive conditional generation would have $\\bar{\\Omega}=\\{1,2, \\ldots, c\\}$ and $\\Omega=\\{c+1, c+$ $2, \\ldots, d\\}$. By Bayes' rule, the conditional scores can be recovered exactly from the unconditional score. $$\n\\frac{p_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}^{\\Omega}=\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime} \\mid \\mathbf{x}^{\\bar{\\Omega}}=\\mathbf{y}\\right)}{p_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}^{\\Omega}=\\mathbf{z} \\mid \\mathbf{x}^{\\bar{\\Omega}}=\\mathbf{y}\\right)}=\\frac{p_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime} \\oplus_{\\Omega} \\mathbf{y}\\right)}{p_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{z} \\oplus_{\\Omega} \\mathbf{y}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\oplus_{\\Omega}$ is concatenation along $\\Omega$ and $\\bar{\\Omega}$. Since the unconditional and conditional scores coincide, we can use our $s_{\\theta}$ (learned unconditionally) for conditional sampling (given arbitrary $\\bar{\\Omega}$ ). For a $\\tau$-leaping update rule (Equation 17 or 19 ), one would only modify by changing the values at $\\Omega$.",
    "sedd-8": "An explicit pseudocode of this is given in Algorithm 3. ## 5. Experiments\n\nWe now empirically validate that our score entropy discrete diffusion (SEDD) model on a variety of language modeling tasks. We measure both perplexity (i.e.",
    "sedd-9": "likelihood estimation capabilities) as well as generation quality, finding that our method performs quite well in both aspects. ### 5.1. Model and Training Setup\n\nOur core model is based on the diffusion transformer architecture (Peebles \\& Xie, 2023), which incorporates time conditioning into a standard encoder-only transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2019), although we make some minor modifications such as employing rotary positional encoding (Su et al., 2021). We construct SEDD Absorb and SEDD Uniform, which correspond to the matrices $Q^{\\text {uniform }}$ and $Q^{\\text {absorb }}$ respectively. We tested a geometric noise schedule (that interpolates between $10^{-5}$ and 20), as well as a log-linear noise schedule (the number of changed tokens for total noise $\\bar{\\sigma}(t)$ is approximately $t d$ for both transitions), which helps SEDD Absorb for perplexities. Outside of this, we did not systemically explore noise schedules or alternative loss weightings, although these could likely improve generation quality. When training, we employ sentence packing to create uniform length blocks to feed to our model, which is done typically for language modeling tasks. The only exception to this rule is our experiment on text8, which randomly samples contiguous subsequences to match prior work (Austin et al., 2021) (although we found that this did not substantially change results). We also matched architecture hyperparameters with prior work (including number of layers, hidden dimension, attention heads, etc...), although our models have slightly more parameters $(\\approx 5-10 \\%)$ than a typical transformer due to time conditioning. We also use the same tokenizers as prior work (which otherwise could be a source of artifacts) as well as the same data splits. ### 5.2. Language Modeling Comparison\n\nWe begin by evaluating our model on core language modeling (effectively likelihood-based modeling) on three common datasets across a variety of scales. ### 5.2.1. TEXT 8 DATASET\n\nWe compare on the text8 dataset, a small, character level language modeling task. We follow Austin et al. (2021) for network hyperparameters and dataset splits and compare with methods that employ a similar model size. We report bits per character (BPC) in Table 2. SEDD outperforms other non-autoregressive models and is only beaten by an autoregressive transformer and the discrete flow (which\n\n| Size | Model | LAMBADA | WikiText2 | PTB | WikiText103 | 1BW |\n| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Small | GPT-2 | $\\mathbf{4 5 .",

For a fixed size, the best perplexity is bolded. Our SEDD model with absorbing transition beats GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) on a majority of the tasks and entirely outperforms prior language diffusion models (Austin et al., 2021; Gulrajani \\& Hashimoto, 2023). | Type | Method | BPC $(\\downarrow)$ |\n| :--- | :--- | ---: |\n| Autoregressive Backbone | IAF/SCF | 1.88 |\n|  | AR Argmax Flow | 1.39 |\n|  | Discrete Flow | $\\mathbf{1 . 2 3}$ |\n|  | Autoregressive | $\\mathbf{1 . 2 3}$ |\n| Non-autoregressive | Mult.

Our SEDD models achieve second-best overall result (best for nonautoregressive), only being beaten out by the autoregressive model and a discrete flow (which uses an autoregressive model as a backbone) by a small margin. SEDD also substantially improves upon prior the discrete diffusion model D3PM (Austin et al., 2021). incorporates an autoregressive base distribution) (Tran et al., 2019). Furthermore, SEDD substantially improves upon D3PM (Austin et al., 2021), despite both being built from the same discrete diffusion principles. ### 5.2.2. One Billion Words Dataset\n\nWe also test SEDD on One Billion Words, a more medium sized and real world dataset. We follow He et al. (2022) for the tokenization, training, and model size configurations. In particular, our baselines are all around the size of GPT-2 small. Following He et al. (2022), we compare primarily against other language diffusion models, although we also train a standard autoregressive transformer as a benchmark. We report perplexity values in Table 3. Our SEDD model outperforms all other diffusion language modeling schemes by $50-75 \\%$ lower perplexity (in particular D3PM). Furthermore, SEDD is within 1 perplexity of the autoregressive model, likely matching since we only report an upper bound. | Type | Method | Perplexity $(\\downarrow)$ |\n| :--- | :--- | ---: |\n| Autoregressive | Transformer | $\\mathbf{3 1 . 9 8}$ |\n| Diffusion | D3PM Absorb | $\\leq 77.50$ |\n|  | Diffusion-LM | $\\leq 118.62$ |\n|  | BERT-Mouth | $\\leq 142.89$ |\n|  | DiffusionBert | $\\leq 63.78$ |\n| Ours (Diffusion) | SEDD Uniform | $\\leq 40.25$ |\n|  | SEDD Absorb | $\\leq \\mathbf{3 2 . 7 9}$ |\n\nTable 3: Test perplexities on the One Billion Words\nDataset. The autoregressive result is an exact likelihood, while the diffusion results are upper bounds. SEDD beats all other discrete diffusion models (by at least $2 \\times$ ) while matching the autoregressive baseline. ### 5.2.3. GPT-2 ZERO SHOT TASKS\n\nFinally, we compare SEDD against GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019). We train on OpenWebText as the original WebText dataset has not been made available (this is typical practice and does not meaningfully affect results in practice) (Gokaslan \\& Cohen, 2019) and test on the LAMBADA, WikiText2, PTB, WikiText103, and One Billion Words datasets (which were all of the GPT-2 zero-shot tasks that measured perplexity).",
    "sedd-11": "We recompute baseline likelihoods for all datasets except 1BW, where we encountered unexpected behavior with the public implementations. Our likelihood computation changes from the original setting since we evaluate unconditionally (i.e. without a sliding window), and this results in higher values than originally reported. Our results are reported in Table 1. Our SEDD Absorb beats GPT-2 on a majority of the zero-shot tasks across both sizes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time where a non-autoregressive language model has matched a modern, reasonably sized, and well-known autoregressive model for perplexities. We also compare against the most competitive continuous (Gulrajani \\& Hashimoto, 2023) and discrete (Austin et al., 2021) diffusion baselines, seeing a large improvement over both. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_3ab8b55ed33e08ab5146g-07.jpg?height=692&width=836&top_left_y=215&top_left_x=184)\n(a) Generative Perplexity ( $\\downarrow$ ) vs. Sampling Iterations. | N | a hiring platform that \"includes a fun club <br> meeting place,\" says petitioner's AQQFred- <br> ericks.

We compare SEDD and GPT-2 by the perplexity of their analytically generated sequences. Our SEDD models consistently outperform GPT-2, interpolating between a $32 \\times$ speedup and a $6-8 \\times$ improvement based on the chosen step size. The generated text reflects this improved generation capability, as our samples are far more coherent. Additional samples and ablations can be found in Appendix D. 3\n\n### 5.3. Language Generation Comparison\n\nWith our trained models, we compare against prior work in terms of generation quality. In particular, we compare GPT2 with our SEDD Absorb on a variety of scales. Results for SEDD Uniform are given in Appendix D. ### 5.3.1. UNCONDITIONAL GENERATION\n\nWe first compare the quality of unconditional samples between GPT- 2 and SEDD. As most language metrics are meant for comparing conditional generations (Pillutla et al., 2021), we instead measure the generative perplexity of sampled sequences (using a GPT-2 large model for evaluation). This is a simple and common metric (Han et al., 2022; Dieleman et al., 2022) but can easily be \"hacked\" by simple distribution annealing methods. So, we compare analytically sampled generations (i.e. no temperature scaling). For SEDD, we simulate using 32 to 2048 steps, which approximates the learned distribution with minimal error for a large number of steps (the sequences are length 1024). Our results (both the measured generative perplexity and some samples) are shown in Figure 1. SEDD matches GPT-2 quality using $32 \\times$ fewer network evaluations and outperforms by $6-8 \\times$ when using the full 2048 steps. Furthermore, SEDD forms a predictable log-log linear pareto frontier between the number of sampling steps and generative perplexity. However, each network evaluation is different due to the KV-cache, which introduces a cost benefit tradeoff that we discuss more in Section 6. ### 5.3.2. INFILLING CONDITIONAL GENERATION\n\nFinally, we showcase SEDD's ability for conditional generation. We generate samples conditioned on a fixed amount of input text (from the WebText dataset) and compare their MAUVE scores (Pillutla et al., 2021). For SEDD, we consider two prompting strategies: standard generation given the beginning and infilling using the beginning and end, although obviously more sampling strategies exist (and several are visualized in Table 4). We compare against GPT-2 and SSD-LM (Han et al., 2022), a competitive language diffusion model built for this task (all models are medium sized). Interestingly, a critical component for both baselines is distribution annealing: nucleus sampling for autoregressive modeling (Holtzman et al., 2019) (which clips the token probability) and thresholding for diffusion (Li et al., 2022; Lou \\& Ermon, 2023) (which constrains generation to disallow paths in low probability spaces). As introducing similar annealing methods for SEDD is out of scope for this paper, we compare against both the annealed and un-annealed baselines samples. Our results are given in Table 5. SEDD is highly competitive with the best configuration for both baselines, in fact beating both when using standard prompting. This is rather notable since SEDD does not use distribution annealing and does not explicitly encode left to right prompting as an architectural inductive bias (while GPT-2 and SSD-LM were trained explicitly for autoregressive-like generation). A bow and arrow is a traditional weapon that enables an attacker to attack targets at a range within a meter or maybe two meters.",

SEDD also offers more flexibility (enabling infilling generation with comparable performance) and does not require distribution annealing techniques for good generation. ## 6. Related Work\n\nContinuous Diffusion Models for Text Data. Initially proposed by Li et al. (2022), continuous language diffusion models embed tokens in a latent space, learn a diffusion model there, and take the nearest neighbor to dequantize. While initial versions struggled, these models have achieved significant results by iterating on several empirical components. For example, prior works improve downstream performance with alternative loss functions (moving away from likelihood-based score matching) (Han et al., 2022; Mahabadi et al., 2023) and explicitly encoding conditional information (e.g. inputting an infilling mask) (Gong et al., 2023; Dieleman et al., 2022). Additionally, distribution annealing methods like thresholding ( Li et al., 2022) and classifier-free guidance (Ho, 2022) can further improve generation quality, although recent work has shown that methods like self-conditioning (Strudel et al., 2022) and designing a less sparse embedding space (e.g. based on bits) (Chen et al., 2022) can obviate the need for such methods. Finally, Gulrajani \\& Hashimoto (2023) showed that, with many surgical changes to the training paradigm, it is possible for language diffusion models to begin approaching autoregressive performance for likelihoods. Discrete Diffusion Models. Most discrete diffusion works follow the framework set out by D3PM (Austin et al., 2021) which mimics \"mean prediction\" (Ho et al., 2020). These discrete diffusion methods are largely applied to fields other than language (e.g. images), likely due to empirical challenges. Despite this, some works have shown strong performance on language, particularly for seq-to-seq tasks and more efficient generation (Zheng et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2023). Notably, from these works discrete diffusion has tended to be advantageous over continuous diffusion in reducing network evaluations. SEDD vs Prior Work. SEDD is a discrete diffusion model that focuses on score matching, the crucial ingredient for continuous diffusions (Song \\& Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020). Many such works also focus on reversing a discrete diffusion process (Campbell et al., 2022; Benton et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023), so score entropy is naturally related with prior training objectives. However, SEDD focuses on a principled, scalable, and performant objective (namely denoising score entropy), filling in shortcomings found in previous works. In particular, prior methods train either with the equivalent of implicit score entropy (which is intractable and high variance) or propose alternate losses that suffer from other issues. These critical differences enable large improvements for language tasks, where prior discrete diffusion models have conspicuously struggled on. Furthermore, SEDD achieves better results (for both perplexity and generation) than even continuous diffusion models (without resorting to empirically driven heuristics). This is desirable since discrete data should necessitate a novel approach. Future work could adapt empirical designs from continuous diffusion, further improving performance. Finally, SEDD challenges autoregressive models, achieving competitive perplexities (beating GPT-2) and generation quality (beating nucleus sampling). While there is still a large gap with modern large language models, we believe that future work can bridge this using SEDD as a backbone. SEDD vs Autoregressive Sampling Iterations. SEDD and autoregressive models have significantly different sampling procedures due to the introduction of the KV-cache for standard decoder-only transformer models. In particular, this complicates the inference code (as each network pass changes from being a standard full batch forward) and trades\noff speed with memory. For example, for our (known) unoptimized codebase and the existing huggingface transformers library (Wolf et al., 2020), we observed that SEDD matches autoregressive inference time when using around 100 steps but can increase the batch size by roughly $4-6$ times by removing the KV-cache memory. Future work will likely decrease the steps required for optimal generation (similar to existing work in standard diffusion (Song et al., 2021a)) which can improve this tradeoff. ## 7. Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced score entropy discrete diffusion (SEDD) models, a discrete diffusion model that is parameterized by the concrete score and can be trained efficiently with our novel score entropy loss. SEDD beats previous language diffusion models and rivals autoregressive models for both perplexity and quality. We hope that future work can build off our framework to defines alternatives to the modern autoregressive language modeling paradigm. ## Impact Statement\n\nThis paper proposes work that advances the field of natural language generation. Outside of existing ethical questions for this area (e.g. bias, toxicity, fake content), our approach does not present any specific danger as the core work is largely theoretical and not at the scale to pose a specific problem. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis project was supported by NSF (\\#1651565), ARO (W911NF-21-1-0125), ONR (N00014-23-1-2159), CZ Biohub, a Stanford HAI GCP grant.

Latent normalizing flows for discrete sequences. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 7673-7682. PMLR, 2019. ## A. Proof of Main Results\n\nProof of Prop 3.2. Given infinite samples, the loss becomes equivalent to minimizing\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\theta} \\sum_{x, y \\neq x} p(x) w_{x y}\\left(s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}-\\frac{p(y)}{p(x)} \\log s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere we have removed constants not depending on $\\theta$. This is minimized when\n\n$$\ns_{\\theta}(x)_{y}-\\frac{p(y)}{p(x)} \\log s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}\n$$\n\nis minimized for all $x, y$. Taking a derivative with respect to $s$ and setting to 0 , we see that this occurs when $s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}=\\frac{p(y)}{p(x)}$, which can be easily checked to be optimal as the function is convex as a function of $s$. One can check that the loss is 0 at the minimum. Proof of Prop 3.3. The trick is the categorical equivalent of the divergence theorem. In particular, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p} \\sum_{y \\neq x} \\frac{p(y)}{p(x)} f(x, y) & =\\sum_{x, y: x \\neq y} \\frac{p(y)}{p(x)} p(x) f(x, y) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{x, y: x \\neq y} p(y) f(x, y) \\\\\n& =\\mathbb{E}_{y \\sim p} \\sum_{x \\neq y} f(x, y) \\\\\n& =\\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p} \\sum_{y \\neq x} f(y, x)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor abitrary $f$. By setting $f(x, y)=w_{x y} \\log s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}$, we get that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p}\\left[\\sum_{y \\neq x} w_{x y}\\left(s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}-\\frac{p(y)}{p(x)} \\log s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}+K\\left(\\frac{p(y)}{p(x)}\\right)\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& =\\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p}\\left[\\sum_{y \\neq x} w_{x y} s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}-w_{y x} \\log s_{\\theta}(y)_{x}+w_{x y} K\\left(\\frac{p(y)}{p(x)}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the desired equivalent (as the last term does not depend on $\\theta$ ). Proof of Thm 3.4. This is similar to the same denoising variant for concrete score matching. We just need to show that the $\\log s_{\\theta}\\left(x_{t}\\right)_{y} p_{t} \\frac{p_{t}(y)}{p_{t}}$ marginalizes out, since everything else does not change or is a constant. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p} \\sum_{y \\neq x} f(x, y) \\frac{p(y)}{p(x)} & =\\sum_{y \\neq x} f(x, y) p_{t}(y) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{y \\neq x} \\sum_{x_{0}} f\\left(x_{t}, y\\right) p\\left(y \\mid x_{0}\\right) p_{0}\\left(x_{0}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\mathbb{E}_{x_{0} \\sim p_{0}} \\sum_{y \\neq x} f(x, y) \\frac{p\\left(y \\mid x_{0}\\right)}{p\\left(x \\mid x_{0}\\right)} p\\left(x \\mid x_{0}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\mathbb{E}_{x_{0} \\sim p_{0}, x \\sim p\\left(\\cdot \\mid x_{0}\\right)} \\sum_{y \\neq x} f(x, y) \\frac{p\\left(y \\mid x_{0}\\right)}{p\\left(x \\mid x_{0}\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nApplying this to our loss when $f(x, y)=w_{x y} \\log s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}$ gives us\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p}\\left[\\sum_{y \\neq x} w_{x y}\\left(s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}-\\frac{p(y)}{p(x)} \\log s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}+K\\left(\\frac{p(y)}{p(x)}\\right)\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& =\\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p}\\left[\\sum_{y \\neq x} w_{x y}\\left(s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}+K\\left(\\frac{p(y)}{p(x)}\\right)\\right)\\right]-\\mathbb{E}_{x_{0} \\sim p_{0}, x \\sim p\\left(\\cdot \\mid x_{0}\\right)}\\left[\\sum_{y \\neq x} \\frac{p\\left(y \\mid x_{0}\\right)}{p\\left(x \\mid x_{0}\\right)} w_{x y} \\log s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}\\right] \\\\\n& =\\mathbb{E}_{x_{0} \\sim p_{0}, x \\sim p\\left(\\cdot \\mid x_{0}\\right)}\\left[w_{x y}\\left(s_{\\theta}(x)_{y} \\frac{p\\left(y \\mid x_{0}\\right)}{p\\left(x \\mid x_{0}\\right)} \\log s_{\\theta}(x)_{y}+K\\left(\\frac{p(y)}{p(x)}\\right)\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nProof of Thm 3.6. The full bound is given by\n\n$$\n-\\log p_{0}^{\\theta}\\left(x_{0}\\right) \\leq \\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{DWDSE}}\\left(x_{0}\\right)+D_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\left(p_{T \\mid 0}\\left(\\cdot \\mid x_{0}\\right) \\| \\pi\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {DWDSE }}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} \\mathbb{E}_{x_{t} \\sim p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(\\cdot \\mid x_{0}\\right)} \\sum_{y \\neq x_{t}} Q_{t}\\left(x_{t}, y\\right)\\left(s_{\\theta}\\left(x_{t}, t\\right)_{y}-\\frac{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(y \\mid x_{0}\\right)}{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(x_{t} \\mid x_{0}\\right)} \\log s_{\\theta}(x, t)_{y}+K\\left(\\frac{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(y \\mid x_{0}\\right)}{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(x_{t} \\mid x_{0}\\right)}\\right)\\right) d t\n$$\n\nEffectively, $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {DWSDE }}$ is the path measure KL divergence (Campbell et al., 2022; Song et al., 2021b), and the proof follows similarly. In particular, we have that, by the data processing inequality\n\n$$\n-\\log p_{0}^{\\theta}\\left(x_{0}\\right)=D_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\left(\\delta_{x_{0}} \\| p_{0}^{\\theta}\\right) \\leq D_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\left(\\mathbb{P}_{x_{0}} \\| \\mathbb{P}^{\\theta}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbb{P}_{x_{0}}$ is the path measure for the reverse of the noising process applied to $\\delta_{x_{0}}$ and $\\mathbb{P}^{\\theta}$ is the learned reverse process. Generally, we can replace $\\delta_{x_{0}}$ with a more general data distribution $p_{\\text {data }}$, with the computation remaining the same. We have,\n\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\left(\\mathbb{P}_{x_{0}} \\| \\mathbb{P}^{\\theta}\\right) \\leq \\mathbb{E}_{x_{T} \\sim p_{T \\mid 0}\\left(\\cdot \\mid x_{0}\\right)}\\left[D_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\left(\\mathbb{P}_{x_{0}}\\left(\\cdot \\mid x_{T}\\right) \\| \\mathbb{P}^{\\theta}\\left(\\cdot \\mid x_{T}\\right)\\right)\\right]+D_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\left(p_{T \\mid 0}\\left(\\cdot \\mid x_{0}\\right) \\| \\pi\\right)\n$$\n\nWe analyze the term $\\mathbb{E}_{x_{T}} D_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\left(\\mathbb{P}_{x_{0}}\\left(\\cdot \\mid x_{T}\\right) \\| \\mathbb{P}^{\\theta}\\left(\\cdot \\mid x_{T}\\right)\\right)$, which we can compute by Dynkin's formula (Hanson, 2007; Campbell et al., 2022), which, similar to Girsanov's Theorem for standard SDEs (\u00d8ksendal, 1987), allows one to compute the change in measure. In particular, by applying Theorem 7.1 of Hanson (2007) with degenerate SDE coefficients, we find the expectation to be given explicitly by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{0}^{T} \\mathbb{E}_{x_{t} \\sim p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(\\cdot \\mid x_{0}\\right)} & \\sum_{y \\neq x_{t}} \\bar{Q}_{t}^{\\theta}\\left(y, x_{t}\\right)-Q_{t}\\left(y, x_{t}\\right) \\log \\left(\\bar{Q}_{t}^{\\theta}\\left(x_{t}, y\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& +Q_{t}\\left(y, x_{t}\\right) \\log Q_{t}\\left(y, x_{t}\\right)+Q_{t}\\left(x_{t}, y\\right) K\\left(\\frac{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(y \\mid x_{0}\\right)}{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(x_{t} \\mid x_{0}\\right)}\\right) d t\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince our reverse rate matrices $\\bar{Q}_{t}^{\\theta}$ are parameterized with $s_{\\theta}$, we can simplify the above to\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} \\mathbb{E}_{x_{t} \\sim p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(\\cdot \\mid x_{0}\\right)} \\sum_{y \\neq x_{t}} Q_{t}\\left(x_{t}, y\\right)\\left(s_{\\theta}\\left(x_{t}, t\\right)_{y}+K\\left(\\frac{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(y \\mid x_{0}\\right)}{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(x_{t} \\mid x_{0}\\right)}\\right)\\right)-Q_{t}\\left(y, x_{t}\\right) \\log s_{\\theta}(y, t)_{x_{t}} d t\n$$\n\nTo finalize, we simply note that the summation over $Q\\left(y, x_{t}\\right) \\log \\left(s_{\\theta}(y, t)_{x_{t}}\\right)$ can be simplified with the (reverse of) the trick used for proving 3.3 . $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}_{x_{t} \\sim p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(\\cdot \\mid x_{0}\\right)} \\sum_{y \\neq x_{t}} Q\\left(y, x_{t}\\right) \\log s_{\\theta}(y)_{x_{t}} & =\\sum_{x_{t}, y \\neq x_{t}} p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(x_{t} \\mid x_{0}\\right) Q\\left(y, x_{t}\\right) \\log s_{\\theta}(y)_{x_{t}} \\\\\n& =\\mathbb{E}_{y \\sim p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(\\cdot \\mid x_{0}\\right)} \\frac{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(x_{t} \\mid x_{0}\\right)}{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(y \\mid x_{0}\\right)} Q\\left(y, x_{t}\\right) \\log s_{\\theta}(y)_{x_{t}} \\\\\n& =\\mathbb{E}_{x_{t} \\sim p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(\\cdot \\mid x_{0}\\right)} \\frac{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(y \\mid x_{0}\\right)}{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(x_{t} \\mid x_{0}\\right)} Q\\left(x_{t}, y\\right) \\log s_{\\theta}\\left(x_{t}\\right)_{y}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the last line is just a permutation of the notation of $x_{t}$ and $y$. As such, we get the desired loss\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} \\mathbb{E}_{x_{t} \\sim p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(\\cdot \\mid x_{0}\\right)} \\sum_{y \\neq x_{t}} Q_{t}\\left(x_{t}, y\\right)\\left(s_{\\theta}\\left(x_{t}, t\\right)_{y}-\\frac{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(y \\mid x_{0}\\right)}{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(x_{t} \\mid x_{0}\\right)} \\log s_{\\theta}(x, t)_{y}+K\\left(\\frac{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(y \\mid x_{0}\\right)}{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(x_{t} \\mid x_{0}\\right)}\\right)\\right) d t\n$$\n\nProof of Thm 4.1. This can be shown by Bayes' rule:\n\n$$\np_{0 \\mid t}\\left(x_{0} \\mid x_{t}\\right)=\\frac{p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(x_{t} \\mid x_{0}\\right) p_{0}\\left(x_{0}\\right)}{p_{t}\\left(x_{t}\\right)}=p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(x_{t} \\mid x_{0}\\right) \\frac{p_{0}\\left(x_{0}\\right)}{p_{t}\\left(x_{t}\\right)}\n$$\n\nWe have $p_{0}=\\exp (-\\sigma Q) p_{t}$ and $p_{t \\mid 0}\\left(x_{t} \\mid x_{0}\\right)=\\exp (\\sigma Q)_{x_{t}, x_{0}}$, so the theorem follows. Proof of Thm 4.2. Using our factorization assumption we get that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& D_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\left(p_{t-\\Delta t \\mid t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t-\\Delta t} \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right) \\| p_{t-\\Delta t \\mid t}^{\\theta}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t-\\Delta t} \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& =-\\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x}_{t-\\Delta t} \\sim p_{t-\\Delta t \\mid t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t-\\Delta t} \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right)}\\left[\\log p_{t-\\Delta t \\mid t}^{\\theta}\\left(x_{t-\\Delta t}^{i} \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right)\\right]+C\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $C$ is a constant independent of $\\theta$. We simply need to minimize the following cross entropy loss for each $i$\n\n$$\n-\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x}_{t-\\Delta t} \\sim p_{t-\\Delta t \\mid t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t-\\Delta t} \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right)}\\left[\\log p_{t-\\Delta t \\mid t}^{\\theta}\\left(x_{t-\\Delta t}^{i} \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nOur $\\tau$-leaping condition implies that our transition assumes no change in other dimensions, so in particular $p_{t-\\Delta t}^{i}\\left(x_{t-\\Delta t}^{i} \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right)=p_{t-\\Delta t \\mid t}^{\\theta}\\left(x_{t}^{1} \\ldots x_{t-\\Delta t}^{i} \\ldots x_{t}^{d} \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right)$.

Additional Experimental Details\n\n## C.1. Diffusion Details\n\nThe geometric noise distribution is $\\bar{\\sigma}(t)=\\sigma_{\\min }^{1-t} \\sigma_{\\max }^{t}$. The log linear noise schedule is $\\bar{\\sigma}(t)=-\\log (1-(1-\\epsilon t))$ for some small epsilon for numerical stability as $t \\rightarrow 1$, commonly $10^{-3}$ or $10^{-4}$. These noise schedules were chosen such that the prior loss $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\left(p_{T \\mid 0}\\left(\\cdot x_{0}\\right) \\| \\pi\\right)$ and the approximation of $p_{\\text {data }}$ with $p_{\\bar{\\sigma}(0)}$ are negligible. We typically scale the uniform transition matrix down by $\\frac{1}{N}$ and take $p_{\\text {base }}$ to be uniform. For the absorbing state, we take $p_{\\text {base }}$ to be the MASK state with some leakage of probability to a random non-MASK state (to avoid inf KL divergence, although this is negligible and is not used for generation in practice). ## C.2. Model Details\n\nOur model train with flash attention (Dao et al., 2022) with fused kernels wherever applicable. We also use the adaLN-zero time information network of (Peebles \\& Xie, 2023) with 128 hidden dimension. Following previous work, we parameterize the network with the total noise level instead of the time $t$. We also found it easier to postprocess the output of our network to form $s_{\\theta}$, rather than outputting it directly. Concretely, we exponentiate (which maintains positivity) to be beneficial to avoid numerical errors and also found that scaling by $e^{\\bar{\\sigma}}-1$ helps for absorbing diffusion. SEDD models have the same hidden dimensions, number of blocks, and number of heads as their corresponding GPT-2 models. However, SEDD models also use a separate word embedding matrix and output matrix. In total, SEDD small and SEDD medium have around 90M parameters and 320 M non embedding parameters respectively (compared to GPT- 2 small 86M and GPT-2 medium 304M non-embedding parameters respectively).",
    "sedd-33": "## C.3. Training Details\n\nAll models were trained with a batch size of 512 and trained with a learning rate of $3 \\times 10^{-4}$. We clip our gradient norm to 1 and have a linear warmup schedule for the first 2000 iterations. We also use a 0.9999 EMA. We trained on nodes of 8 A100 80GB or 16 A100 40GB GPUs, using gradient accumulation when our batch size did not fit into memory (as is the case for SEDD medium). ## C.4. Hyperparameter Search\n\nWe did not do a hyperparameter or achitecture search. Our hyperparameters were chosen for convenience purposes (e.g. the architecture was taken from DDiT (Peebles \\& Xie, 2023), but we use rotary embeddings since they come included in previous work (Gulrajani \\& Hashimoto, 2023)) or were naturally lifted from previous training recipes (e.g. the ubiquitous $3 \\times 10^{-4}$ learning rate, 0.9999 EMA$)$. ## C.5.

The non-autoregressive baselines are, in order, Multinomial Diffusion (Hoogeboom et al., 2021), MAC (Shih et al., 2022), Bayesian Flow Networks (Graves et al., 2023), and D3PM (Austin et al., 2021).",

GPT-2\n\nThe only two non GPT-2 baselines are PLAID (Gulrajani \\& Hashimoto, 2023) and D3PM (with Absorbing Transition) (Austin et al., 2021). We retrain both models (as they have not been trained with our exact specifications) to compare against small models. We reuse our model architecture and match hyperparameters (i.e. model size, training specifications). ## C.6. Likelihood Evaluation Details\n\nWe randomly sample with 1000 timesteps to Monte Carlo estimate our likelihoods. We use invertible tokenizers, as is customary for GPT-2 experiments. We report results on the test set for all datasets besides WikiText02, where we report on the train set since WikiText02 and WikiText103 share the same test set. ## C.7. Unconditional Generation Details\n\nWe generate using the Tweedie denoiser, which performed slightly better than the Euler sampling (typically by 1-4 perplexity points). We generated 1000 samples for all models. ## C.8. Conditional Generation Details\n\nWe follow Han et al. (2022) and generate 5 samples for each ground truth sample before calculating MAUVE. Note that this implies that we compare 5000 generated samples and 1000 ground truth samples. We sample by conditioning on 50 tokens and generating a new 50 . For autoregressive-type sampling, this means we take the first 50 tokens. For SEDD with infilling, this means we clamp all input text sizes to a max of 100 tokens and condition on the first and last 25 tokens. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_3ab8b55ed33e08ab5146g-17.jpg?height=1164&width=1529&top_left_y=231&top_left_x=271)\n\nFigure 2: Generative Perplexity for SEDD Uniform.",

In general, we found that this did not train well, resulting in $3-4 \\times$ higher likelihood loss, which corresponds to $10,000 \\times$ higher perplexity. Similarly,\n\n## D.2. Further Evaluation of Generative Perplexity\n\nWe further evaluate our generative perplexity for uniform models as well as different sampling schemes (analytic sampling based on Tweedie's vs Euler sampling based off of reverse diffusion). Results are shown in Figure 2. Generally, we find that uniform does not produce the same linear tradeoff curve as absorbing (most likely due to a bottleneck in generation quality). Futhermore, analytic generally outperforms Euler sampling, and this is a major factor for the uniform model. We also generated on our trained baselines (Austin et al., 2021; Gulrajani \\& Hashimoto, 2023), finding both performed substantially worse than our SEDD Absorb baseline but slightly better than our SEDD Uniform.",

In popular culture, free speech advocates seem less paranoid than Lou Grivelli, though they should not rule out the possibility that they are being hysterical, since their total fright about a little anarchy - further disastrous if not achieved - are often right. Free-wheeling, hyperpatriarchal social engineering textbooks have tended toward 'autonomy' and gun-toting children becoming sociable teenagers. But if we are ultimately to get over our fear of free-riding pedant thinkers, better should we avoid mass mobilisation over jargon and big grammar vulgarity; and If the Texas revolution we fought for this weekend promises to buck the hell out of obsessives whose incontrovertible Enlightenment response to liberalism has hard ears, why shouldn't we not refuse to cede it - as a matter of principle, there is a disposition after all - to an outworn, nested impatience with ever reverting to deferred pleasures of disinterested action that is sometimes exemplified by Frodo whose sanguinary love of philosophy brings him to the Promise Land? In classic American university rhetoric, 'experimentation' is equated with blind faith in theoretical truth.

    "sedd-44": "But what is it really? That's also the subject of next post. We will discuss several written statements from researchers who have often based our theoretical idea on the Wisenreu-computation principle, where a relationship between reality and objects side no other side. Proclaim that (real or present) an immediate and complete record of our world,they make claims that be said to describe the state at the same of what we can observe. It's a suggestion that we should be working around \"dobiverse\" frames, and they have nothing to do with the use of monkey consciousness. The moment that will seem like perhaps this is a post of the late '60s. What has distinguished it from these claims? Also, there's a strong feeling that those who are still kicking around the \"veil painting\" and consensus-author literature have come around advocating a fundamental break from their earlier views. I don't I should talk here again. Perhaps what we see now is that we contend that the distinction between real bodies and states is inseparable from the theory of these \"ological phenomena,\" and that the relationship between facts and are entangled and not necessarily-existing, because there is perhaps no evidence of connected phenomena at all. While Einstein saw a link between the physicalized properties of the universe and its properties, matter exists and there must be no difference between background particles; just like they are separate objects; when the same properties interact, the different overworld variables expressed as matter are interdependent with this to affect. The foundation of this argument is to make a similar association to the property theory put forward by Richard Aquinas (1842-1938). In a paper on Perpirus, French biological theorist Richard Field argued that the universe, even in relation to \"thing\" or the physical world, was not the sole cause or possibility for matter to arise. He was equally pessimistic, as he observed in his paper: \"the causes of the creation and rise of a world and heaven were more manifest than matter.\" So what happens to matter, what happened to land? (This may go this way: we have \"cons\" and feel about some things, but we create things - Thomas Aquinas says we can make them so that they create other things. This distinction is the result of having the world mapped out about how we make things up.) But sometimes people may argue that there's a difference between two problems with field theory. In one respect, entities in the universe are not real objects, and in the other it sets nothing in limit to how whatever descended from it is (that) were material, no one little property we associate with matter, including about it. Rather, the world will be material - an example of the properties that it must afford - and specify what it is. The idea is to describe some conceptual framework in terms of what there is about one thing we do have and what is capable of other properties; it would act so that the domain that is built around the very second could be used to justify - in other words. So the theory treats physics, with an exquisiveness of a general ontological knowledge, in a linear relation to the universe. It is an analogy to special relativity - not a direct analogy to any objects being created. In a remarkable book and probably a manual of metaphysics, Richard Field writes: \"the really is about particular relations, as, when something objects interfere with one another, they are dependent on a unique 'material' (whose object or effect he considers this to have different properties on it).\" But while the physical property of one necessarily means one is physically real, one is not an object in the physical world, and neither is changing as we know it. So how is that? Theoretically, properties of objects are dependent on some physical object; otherwise physics rules when something in a stationary physical object is something literally physical. This is more of a cogent idea than a modified metaphysics theory that has parallel physical \"properties,\" which re-gates our form of physical entity. Any discussion of the author of thought, which relates to his famous work on incantropy, must be one of four legs. Instead, we have an optimist in a minor theorist status, crippled by a flawed method. What is more productive than few ideas? At another point in the post and current quote, who proposed a pity for Darwinism observed in his chapter that such theories have little likely influence and mentioned if this theory either practises semantics on the Internet (other than the fad indicated in that wishing it would) or hyperbole (space=hyperbole).

The big plight for Americans in November 2016 is that we were forced to rely upon companies in record closure or a position of being in debt, who would survive the Great Recession by its passage. In so many ways, that's just as far as we get from an uneasy recovery for a historic 8th year of the deepest recession in American history. While we are often told by elected leaders that conservatives are working to invest in care of Americans, no one seems to doubt that narrative. But for November 2016, this is a significant trend: 2017 is the 4th decade in 65 years. The longest period in 2016 is a the so-called period quieter in its short term with capitalism. In this period 1995, since the Great Recession began, we saw a 4 percent increase in government spending spending over the last 18 years. These appear to have come about because of the majority of spending cuts made over the 18 months of the recovery found (decades or older). This period has continued into this period. Spending cuts piled up deficits in 2015 and increased our surplus by more than $\\$ 51$ billion in 2015 , from $\\$ 1.3$ trillion in 2012 . Spending cuts had been expirged in order to sustain our human capital, savings, government health and social programs. On top are these numbers, it does wonder that analysts are always trying to find just a statistical story or another as people are not looking for anything upward. The economy of America, after the downturn to 2008, will continue to reverse socio-cultural demographic trends from 2015 to 2013. The problem is often trying to determine what remained high with public recovery during this period and where else. Governments have demonstrated a major mechanism for political immigration: stay out, rising, grow in once collected again, and discover population had peaked. Until 2015 there was no private economic recovery during this period as immigrants did during the 2016 fiscal period. Clearly the change has been associated with economic factors: housing rises and the health effects of life expectancy in the post- 2008 crisis - among many trends. Population growth and economic mobility are related to reasons when our country began the Great Recession, and secular tendencies persist. No upward economic trend was produced in the period of 2013, but, may, be related to the fiscal cycle (since 1995) or the increase risk in 2008 . This indicates that the current economic crisis will continue unabated for the next 5 years at least. Figure 10: SEDD-Absorbing Small.

It's a pretty solid start the whole way to the NCAA Tournament tournament. I know games will start coming out and I have confidence to go. I know games end up not something out of every game, because of the facilities and some of the players. I have one team that already has not even has their facilities come up.

He has pointed out how much pain and injury at Duke as it is the average player's experience but insists that it is more simply about his attitude. \"I ever had all of this negative ones during my injury career and that've changed since, and it was a little 'no' in the first couple of February, but there was something positive. As you can tell, that that kept me out for a lot of months,\" he said. \"I just kept going from there.

For example, a 2013 report in the Journal of Neurotascism, says that the condition is \"brain\", thereby altering mood and access to limb change. And an updated Case reports that \"preliminary reports suggest that a new cure to alzheimer's disease and malaria may have been discovered\". People's Week in Music re-published these findings. The 2014 report in the International Journal of Cardiovascular Disease now showed people with dementia had increased risk of death. Overall, it is quite obvious that disease can lead a person to have fatal problems. Alzheimer's disease has been very well studied. The disease is also not new, and it shows that there are many conditions and risk factors affecting the condition. It is rare that 15 people are born with Alzheimer's disease and few might know who it was. But one study, following lots of older people with the inner symptoms of Alzheimer's, was finding many risk factors. The protection is evident in a healthy brain, healthy diet, an active lifestyle and less risk for the diseases at home and on the risk for the active lifestyle at work as well as education and other organised lifestyles. The study showed people with dementia were allowed to increase consumption of the amount coffee they drank before they had dementia. Health-related changes\nAlzheimer's disease is by far the main cause of dementia in the US. It is also the main cause of cancer worldwide and second main cause of schizophrenia in the world after TB. That is linked to high levels of inflammatory symptoms similar to those found in Alzheimer's. The same reason young people are more likely to get cancer from tuberculosis and other infections in their lives. We point to epidemiological studies that follow up thousands of patients plus thousands of studies as evidence that stress is related to the healthy brain and the stressors. And then diabetes occurs most often. What might be the cause? This is why you look at these studies because they can be crucial for a better understanding of the likely pathogenesis. The robust disease in alzheimer's is closely linked to inflammation. Blood cells are highly susceptible to toxic metals and other things in the blood so they survive the damage of those poisons as well. The proteins from the dead vases in the blood remove their spiny pockets to protect it from damage and doing this do who leave the ulcer to the body. When damaged, the great Alzheimer's disease is devastatingly severe. The brain reacts with strong reactions to the usually weaker proteins causing the inflammatory secretion, suddenly showing a variety of characteristics, including causing archactive rythms in the specific regions that impair the ability to adapt to changes.
