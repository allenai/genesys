      "1. You need to think of a meaningful name of the GABUnit you are designing or\n",

      "   have an idea of the function of this GABUnit. By defining placeholders, you\n",
      "   are defining the outline of the design you want to implement.\n",
      "2. When calling a GABUnit, you should pass both the X and Z to the GABUnit. You\n",
      "   should pass Z in the kwargs manner, for example {GABUnit}(X, **Z).\n",
      "3. When defining a GABUnit object in __init__, you should privide the type hint,\n",
      "   for example, ```self.unit: GABUnit = {unit_name}(**kwargs) ```, remember to\n",
      "   pass such a kwargs which allows more customized arguments you will define\n",
      "   later in your actual implementation to be passed in. When you defines a\n",
      "   GABUnit, it should be either a known GABUnit or a placeholder of a GABUnit\n",
      "   you are going to design. It should never be something else such as nn.Module\n",
      "   or a constant. The system will automatically detect the GABUnit placeholders\n",
      "   and create a new empty GABUnit or fetch it from the base if it is already\n",
      "   defined.\n",
      "4. Be sure to design the block in a top-down manner, be patient and think\n",
      "   long-run, do never think of designing everything at once. Learn to define\n",
      "   placeholders that may carry out complicated operations and implement them\n",
      "   later. Especially when you are working on the root GABUnit. \n",
      "5. Be sure to be innovative, do not copy the existing designs such as the\n",
      "   vanilla Transformer block. Be creative and think of a new design that can\n",
      "   defeat the existing state of the art models. Try your best to transcend the\n",
      "   human experts!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, give your design, don't be hurry to try to design everything at once, be\n",
